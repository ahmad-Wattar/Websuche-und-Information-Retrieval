I dont think that we have supernatural powers but at the same time feel that what holds many back are our own minds.

My response is always that anyone can learn a foreign language. You may learn faster or slower than the next but if you work hard you will learn the language.\nAdults are no different than kids in our ability to learn except that we have this intellectual or emotional baggage that tells that we cant do something or that it is too difficult and not worth trying. Kids just do it because it is part of their life.\nIve been thought about this for a long time and these are just some of my personal rantings about Kids vs Adults in language learning. Heres the blog post that reignited this subject for me.\nIm not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural speaker of the 2nd language. Adults can achieve the same results but it takes time and hard work. Work that kids just saw as part of life and occured naturally for them in their daily activities.\nI think that part of the reason that we think that kids learn easier is because they dont remember how hard it was because it was just part of life. Do you ever think about 2nd grade and say history, math or English class was hard? Probably not.\nAs adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak fluently in 30 days.\nIt takes kids 7-8 years before they speak their native language extremely well. Even then they will be learning it for another 8-10 years depending on their education. Adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this new skill and knowledge. Additionally, adults have become accustomed to learning new thing quickly with their increase intelligence and experience.\nLanguage has a humbling effect and probably takes the same amount of time to learn as an adult as it does as a child. So do I think that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language than adults. NO! Adults are just more aware of all of the hard work it takes to learn a language.\n"}, {"score": 2082.4448, "uuid": "1e7d83aa-4083-5826-8e49-3c1a4f358f18", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-32-26269", "target_hostname": "www.languagestars.com", "target_uri": "http://www.languagestars.com/funimmersion-blog/249-blog-early-is-best.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>Language</em> Stars - <em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> School for <em>Kids</em> - Early <em>is</em> best, but", "snippet": "Why are they <em>learning</em> three <em>languages</em>? &gt;From purely <em>a</em> brain standpoint, <em>learning</em> <em>at</em> <em>a</em> young age <em>is</em> the optimal time.

We go over the answers and I put the same questions on the midterm and final exams. On the exams, they need to answer the questions \u201ctrue or false\u201d and give the scientific reason behind the answer. I\u2019m shocked at the number of students who get this question wrong. I probably shouldn\u2019t be, it\u2019s one of those myths that pervades our society. On top of that, the exercise would not be any fun if the students answered all the questions correctly. It\u2019s a great way to get them interested in the topic.\nWe need our entire brain to function fully. Different abilities are \u201clocalized\u201d in specific areas of the brain. The plasticity of the brain I discussed in previous blogs allows for some reorganization of these abilities if damage to the brain occurs. How much reorganization, and of which skills, depends on the age of the person at the time of the injury. In general, children\u2019s brains are far more plastic than those of adults.\nTwo areas of the brain are largely responsible for our processing of language. Broca\u2019s Area, located in the frontal lobe, allows us to produce language while Wernicke\u2019s Area, located in the temporal lobe, allows us to understand language. Damage to an adult\u2019s brain in either of these areas typically leads to a permanent impairment of language (either the ability to produce language or to understand it based on where the damage is). The brain of an adult has lost its plasticity to reorganize these functions.\nSo, what does all of this have to do with my children? Why are they learning three languages? >From purely a brain standpoint, learning at a young age is the optimal time. For example:\nAll languages use different sounds to create words (called phonemes). There are over 500 known phonemes, but each language uses only a small subset of them (English uses about 30). An infant is able to distinguish between all of the different phonemes in all of the languages that have been studied. This ability, however, begins to decline around age one. The brain actually \u201cprunes away\u201d (or recycles) the connections that are not activated by the environment, so toddlers can only distinguish between the phonemes in the language(s) to which they have been exposed. Makes sense, right? After all, if I don\u2019t actually need those brain connections (I don\u2019t speak Hindi or Korean), I might as well use them for something else. With intensive language immersion, some of these connections can be reestablished as an adult, but not all. Katie and Nick have been exposed to Mandarin from a young age. As I said many times before, they can hear many of the sounds in Mandarin I cannot. Unfortunately, I probably will never be able to hear them correctly. My brain has lost its plasticity for this ability.\nChildren learn a second (or third or fourth) language the same way they learn their first. We don\u2019t actually need to \u201cteach\u201d our children to use language. The finer points of \u201cto, too and two\u201d and \u201ctheir, there and they\u2019re\u201d do need to be taught, but they learn basic language skills just by being exposed to adults talking with them! I really think our ability to learn language so effortlessly is nothing short of miraculous. Children exposed to multiple languages learn them all this way. As adults, we tend to \u201ctranslate\u201d from our first language into our second. It\u2019s not effortless, it\u2019s effortful.\nAnd, finally, with respect to plasticity of the brain\u2014early exposure actually changes the location of the language centers in the brain!!!! (WOW!!). Environmental exposure to multiple languages at an early age actually changes the physical structure of the brain in different (better) ways than later exposure. This simple fact is why Nick and Katie\u2019s brains will forever be more efficient processers of language than my or my husband\u2019s brain. When children learn multiple languages, the same area of the brain is responsible for the processing of all languages. The language areas overlap. With later exposure, the areas of the brain that processes the different languages are adjacent to one another instead of on top of one another. This leads to far less efficient processing and, I suspect, the need to \u201ctranslate\u201d from one language to another.\nIn a nutshell, \u201cEarly is best, but later is better than never\u201d when it comes to learning languages. I\u2019ve said in other blogs that my children already know more Mandarin than I, and their Spanish is moving right along. Their brains are in an optimal state to make use of the environmental exposure to language.\nSo, we do use more than ten percent of our brains, but more importantly, the organization and efficiency of our brains is directly related to our environmental input.\nUntil next week\u2014learn something new and change your brain!\nCindi\nVisit some of our Parent Bloggers on their own blogs:\nCarelys Hepburn:\n"}, {"score": 1841.7015, "uuid": "335dae6d-993d-5186-a6e5-766154106a46", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-32-33486", "target_hostname": "www.languagestars.com", "target_uri": "http://www.languagestars.com/why-learn-young.html", "page_rank": 3.2435896e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Language</em> Stars - <em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> School for <em>Kids</em> - Benefits", "snippet": "Children <em>who</em> learn <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> <em>at</em> <em>a</em> young age also exhibit <em>better</em> problem-solving skills, enhanced spatial relations, and heightened creativity.", "explanation": null, "document": "Parent Testimonials\nThe Benefits of Learning Language Young\nYoung children are uniquely suited to learning a second language. The developing brain is hard-wired to acquire language. Never again will it be this natural or this easy!\nClick to view video of our Education Director Karen Gould discuss the benefits of learning a language young.\nChildren Learn A Second Language Naturally\nExposing your child to a second language while young allows a child to optimize his or her learning potential, helping to shape the brain at its most flexible stage. Young children are uniquely suited to learning a second language.\u00a0 Learning a second language at a young age is cognitively as easy as learning a first language.\nYoung children can acquire native-like fluency as easily as they learned to walk. Where adults have to work through an established first-language system, studying explicit grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young kids learn naturally, absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and rules of a second language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue. The young brain is inherently flexible and uniquely hard-wired to acquire language naturally.\nIn taking advantage of this window of opportunity , young learners enjoy a wide range of benefits:\nLinguistic Benefits\nYoung language learners can acquire native-like fluency as easily as they learned to walk, in contrast to an adult language learner. Where adult learners have to work through an established first-language system, studying explicit grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young learner learns naturally, absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and rules of a second language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue. The young brain is inherently flexible, uniquely hard-wired to acquire language naturally.\nOlder learners lose the ability to hear and reproduce new sounds by age 8-12, according to experts, resulting in a permanent foreign-sounding accent in any language. Younger learners benefit from flexible ear and speech muscles that can still hear the critical differences between the sounds of a second language, as well as reproduce them with native-like quality.\nCognitive Benefits\nWhile some parents worry that starting their toddler on a second language will interfere with developing English skills, the opposite is actually true. Children can differentiate between two languages within the first weeks of life. \"Learning another language actually enhances a child's overall verbal development,\" says Roberta Michnick Golinkoff Ph.D., author of How Babies Talk.\nThe research goes on to show a number of additional cognitive benefits to learning a second language at an early age. Children who study foreign language show higher cognitive performance in overall basic skills in elementary school. According to the College Entrance Examination Board, they go on to score higher on SATs. Children who learn a foreign language at a young age also exhibit better problem-solving skills, enhanced spatial relations, and heightened creativity. Learning a second language early on encourages flexible thinking and communication skills, helping children consider issues from more than one perspective.\nAdditionally, research shows that multilinguals have enhanced memory, planning, and multi-tasking skills. When learning multiple languages young, the brain is trained to attend to salient information and to disregard non-pertinent information, a skill that later supports better focus, memory, planning and multitasking abilities. Research shows that multilinguals use more of their brains than monolinguals and outperform monolinguals on creativity tests.\nLifelong Benefits\nThe gift of language is an investment that last a lifetime!\nYoung learners enrich their lives and open up doors to their future by gaining:\nAn expanded world view.\nGreater intercultural appreciation and sensitivity.\nAbility to learn additional languages more easily.\nA competitive edge in future markets and\u00a0the global marketplace.\nOn Language Learning...\n\"Americans who travel abroad for the first time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the progress that has been made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in foreign languages.\"\nDave Barry\n"}, {"score": 1823.9078, "uuid": "1fcfa100-458b-5bfa-af3e-fed17166a58e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-55-28445", "target_hostname": "www.languagestars.com", "target_uri": "http://www.languagestars.com/about-us/faqs.html", "page_rank": 2.2127848e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Language</em> Stars - <em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> School for <em>Kids</em> - <em>Language</em> Stars FAQs", "snippet": "Children <em>who</em> learn <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> young absorb the <em>language</em> and use it spontaneously without translating through their native tongue. <em>A</em> child&#x27;s <em>learning</em> process fundamentally differs from how adolescents <em>or</em> <em>adults</em> learn <em>language</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Return to Top\nHow can I reinforce Language Stars at home?

We are happy to enroll your child at anytime and welcome your family to begin reaping the many benefits of learning another language immediately!\nReturn to Top\nHow often do children attend?\nChildren are welcome to enroll as many days per week as they choose. Children will progress in their language learning attending once per week; however, attending more than once per week will increase their exposure and practice and will accelerate their progress.\nBenefits of coming twice a week, or attending a 3 hour session:\nMore than double the progress! We have found that students who come for three hours a week progress leaps and bounds beyond children who come for just 85 minutes. Being able to double the exposure time with native speakers, and double the amount of practice time allows children to accelerate their learning both actively and receptively.\nDouble the fun! A second class won't just be a repeat of the first. Within the same weekly theme (such as Mad Science! or I Spy:Treasure Hunt) children will experience different games, art projects, and activities. They'll have twice as much fun!\nDouble the enthusiasm! Children who come to Language Stars twice a week learn the language faster and feel even more confident in and connected to their new language. We have seen that they participate with greater enthusiasm in class and feel more comfortable using the language outside of Language Stars.\nReturn to Top\nWhat is full-immersion?\nFull-immersion is a style of teaching that fully immerses a child in the new language.

Whichever language you choose, you will be providing enormous benefits to your child beyond just the practical ability to speak another language. If there is a particular language that your child is interested in, she will be more motivated to learn it. If there is a family member or friend who speaks another language, your child will be able to take advantage of her Language Stars learning outside her class. In addition, children who learn a second language find it easier to learn a third or fourth language.\nReturn to Top\nIs it too early for my child to start a second language?\nIt is never too early for a child to begin a new language. Children have a unique capability that allows them to learn languages naturally. This capability exists within a unique \"window of opportunity\" from birth to adolescence. After adolescence, children lose this ability to learn a language naturally and then must translate their first language in order to learn a new language. The earlier a child begins a new language, the better.\nReturn to Top\nHow do you track progress?\nWe track progress using our Learning LadderTM and set goals and expectations for each child daily.

learn a foreign language?\nChildren are more susceptible to foreign sounds than adults and adolescents, making them more capable of identifying and forming new sounds.\u00a0 Therefore, they tend to be more successful in the pronunciation of a new language.\nChildren are able to gain a better communicative fluency if they are exposed to a foreign language for a long period of time.\nStudents of foreign language\u00a0benefit academically in many ways as\u00a0neural pathways are enhanced, supporting them in\u00a0many other academic learning\u00a0tasks.\nThe\u00a0early years of childhood are the most significant years in which a development of attitudes toward different cultures is formed.\nChildren who study foreign languages and cultures gain a better understanding of the world and thus have greater potential in international and intercultural communication.\nLearning foreign languages allows children to improve their self concept and sense of accomplishment during school.\nWhy Chinese for Children?\nStarting Chinese studies at an early age can enable children to be more successful with the four tones in Chinese pronunciation, which is crucial for communication.\nA long sequence of training is required for achieving a\u00a0 high level of proficiency since Chinese is listed by the Foreign Service Institute as a Group IV language.\u00a0 This means that learning Chinese takes 2.5 to 3 times the time necessary to gain the same level of proficiency as a Group 1 language such as French, German or Spanish.\u00a0 *The Mandarin Bilingual program allows children to receive the appropriate amount of time needed to gain a high level of proficiency.\nExperts believe that early exposure to an idea or experience that is \"foreign\" can become the driving force for cognitive development.\u00a0 Chinese is a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family.\u00a0 It is completely unrelated to the Indo-European language family, to which English and most other European languages belong.\u00a0 Therefore, an early exposure to Chinese will enhance a child's menatal flexibility, creativity, divergent thinking and complex thinking skills.\nWriting Chinese characters helps children acquire fine motor skills since character writing requires visual-hand coordination and awareness of proportion.\nAlthough Chinese is listed as a Group IV language, its grammar at the\u00a0very basic level is quite simple for children to learn.\u00a0 Unlike Western languages, Chinese characters do not have changes with word endings for gender, case, number, person or tense.\u00a0 The initial stage of Chiense language learning requires imitation and repetition, both of which children enjoy doing, particularly when incorporated into the context of games, rhymes, songs and skits.\nEarly exposure to the Chinese language and culture will provide children with an opportunity to explore lifestyles, values and beliefs that are very different from our own.\u00a0\u00a0We hope the understanding they gain will be of great significance to the harmony\u00a0of our world.\nIn the era of global communication, it is important to be able to negotiate, trade and exchange ideas in foreign languages with appropriate attention to cultural differences.\u00a0 Children will benefit from their early experiences with Chinese studies as they grow up in an increasingly global and multicultural society.\nSince China has maintained one of the fastest growing economies in the world for over twenty years, studying Chinese at an early age can further a child's potential for a future career in international trade and intercultural exchange.\nWe are grateful to\u00a0The Far East Book Co., Ltd. for providing\u00a0the information presented above.\nHome |Principal's Message|Meyonohk Staff||Why a Foreign

Sally S.", "explanation": null, "document": "Foreign Language Learning and Learning Disabilities\nBy: Sally S. Scott and Elaine Manglitz (1997)\nMaking the college transition\nMany individuals with learning disabilities experience difficulty in learning a foreign language. Is it any wonder? Learning disabilities (LD) often affect language-based tasks such as reading, spelling, writing, or listening. Problems in the native language will still be present, if not magnified, in the process of learning a second language system.\nResearch since the 1980's has supported the logical conclusion that there is indeed a link between native and foreign language learning. Results have shown that phonological difficulties (problems with tasks involving putting sounds together and pulling sounds apart in spoken and written language) and orthographic difficulties (problems with sound-symbol tasks in language) have the most immediate and severe impact on foreign language learning. These types of abilities are called on for such fundamental tasks as learning a new alphabet (e.g., Hebrew), a new sound-symbol system (e.g., spelling the nasal sounds in French) or the beginning vocabulary words of any new language. Other areas that have been found to affect foreign language learning include syntactic abilities (use and understanding of the grammatical rules of language), semantics (understanding word meaning and concepts), and short-term memory needed to acquire and practice new language demands.\nResearchers have also identified patterns in developmental history and academic learning that may correlate with later foreign language learning problems. Individuals with learning disabilities who have difficulty learning a foreign language often experienced difficulty or delay in learning to speak, received speech therapy early in their lives, or had a family history of language and learning problems. Academically, they may have had difficulty in learning to read, especially with learning phonics. Early difficulties with spelling and inconsistent use of grammar and mechanics are often part of the individual's learning history and frequently persist into adolescence and adulthood.\nAt the same time that research has been affirming the difficulties in foreign language learning of many students with learning disabilities, an increasing number of individuals with LD are attending college. Recent national figures show that 3-4 percent of all college freshmen identify themselves as having learning disabilities. How students with LD are meeting college foreign language requirements and what accommodations and services are available to them are still relative unknowns.\nCollege accommodations and services\nWith the increased focus in high schools and colleges on preparing students for life and work in a global society, students can expect that more colleges and universities will require the completion of foreign language courses for their degrees. Students with learning disabilities who attend college will find a continuum of services and choices related to foreign languages. Supports and services vary widely ranging from basic classroom and testing accommodations, to special sections of a language, to course substitutions. Although federal law requires colleges and universities to provide reasonable accommodations for students who have documented learning disabilities, the range of accommodations and modifications are determined by individual campuses.\nA survey done in the late 1980's showed that tutoring was the most frequently reported college service for foreign language support. A smaller number of institutions offered an individualized learning pace, and a few colleges had special sections of classes for students who have difficulties completing the foreign language requirements. Almost three-fourths of the colleges and universities were offering course substitutions, although not all of the institutions had a formal, written policy. Colleges and universities that offer course substitutions typically have specific requirements for documentation of the LD. Some also require additional information, such as: a history of difficulty with foreign languages in high school, letters from instructors or tutors, or records of an attempt to complete a foreign language in college.\nOver time, colleges have continued to expand their support of students with LD. Though some campuses provide minimal services in foreign language learning, many have devised creative learning accommodations in order to provide greater access for students with LD. Options and supports include both formal accommodations (specific to the needs of students with LD) and informal supports available to all students in foreign language learning.\nMany programs offer selective advisement to guide students with LD to take a foreign language or programmatic option (such -as study abroad or immersion) that fits their strengths. Supports open to all students such as participating in a conversational lunch group or pairing with a student from a specific country to study and learn the language are also encouraged.\nAdministrative alternatives are frequently used including the option to audit the class before taking it for credit, take a class under a pass/fail condition, or have an extended drop/add date that would not penalize the students. At some institutions, foreign language instructors are willing to provide increased support for students with learning disabilities, including creative multisensory teaching methods and accommodations more specific to foreign language learning (e.g., permission to write dictated questions before composing responses or extended time to formulate replies on oral exams). Some colleges have created additional programmatic options for students with LD, such as: providing one semester of coursework over a two-semester time period, creating a reading or writing \"track\" of a language, or providing a special section of a language that is structured and paced to meet the needs of students with LD.\nIt is clear that with the various requirements, instructional options, accommodations, and modifications related to foreign languages at colleges and universities, it is important for students to be informed consumers when preparing for and choosing a college. Students should start early considering questions similar to the following:\nWhat can I do in high school to prepare for and anticipate problems related to learning a foreign language in college?\nWhat questions do I need to ask when visiting campuses?\nRecommendations\nIf your learning disability has an impact on your foreign language learning and you know you want to attend college, there are ways you can be better prepared to meet college requirements. We recommend two main strategies: get a head start in high school and choose your college carefully.\nGet a head start in high school: Thinking about the college foreign language requirement requires advanced preparation on your part. High school is a good time to learn more about yourself as a foreign language learner. Talc& a foreign language early in high school. Depending on the courses offered at your high school, you may be able to select which language you want to attempt. If your listening/speaking skills are strong, you may want to try Spanish since the regularity of the sound system in Spanish sometimes helps. If you are stronger at reading, you may want to try Latin, which typically does not involve as much oral communication and often helps build vocabulary in English.\nIf you run into difficulty in your foreign language learning, talk with your LD teacher about what is difficult and easy in your foreign language class. Work with this person to generate ideas for you to try, and talk with the foreign language teacher about strategies and accommodations that may assist you. Be sure to keep these teachers informed of your progress.\nIf you continue to have significant difficulty, some high schools now grant foreign language course waivers for students with LD. This means that you may be able to be excused from meeting the high school foreign language requirement. Waivers are a matter of school policy and are not available everywhere, so check with your local school system. Also, be aware that the waiver process has its pros and cons. Though a waiver does prevent the frustration and hardship of trying to learn a foreign language in high school, not all college admissions offices are familiar with this policy and you may be considered \"deficient\" in meeting admission requirements. Be sure to check with your school system and state education agency about how they are coordinating this potential policy gap with colleges and universities. Another factor to consider is that, when you enter college, you may still be required to take a foreign language. Many students with LD report that by working through high school foreign language courses and taking the same language in college (though perhaps starting over at the beginning level course) they are more successful in adjusting to the fast pace of college language instruction.\nDoes this mean you should not have a foreign language waiver if this is available at your high school? No, for some students with LD this is the most appropriate accommodation and is absolutely necessary. But it is important for you to be aware of the later implications and possible planning needs involved. Some colleges may ask for information on how this decision was reached in high school so they can determine what accommodations are most appropriate for you in the college setting. It will be helpful for you to gather information on what supports you used and the strategies you tried when you attempted a foreign language in high school. A letter from your foreign language teacher documenting your effort in class and the difficulties you experienced would also be useful.\nYour college search: As you begin your college search, be sure to consider your foreign language learning needs. As you investigate other supports and services available to college students with learning disabilities, ask specifically about the foreign language requirements and policies in place. Not all colleges require a foreign language. Within a college or university, not all programs of study require foreign language learning. Actively investigate what options are available to any college student attending the institution.\nIf the college or program of study that looks best for you does require a foreign language, ask specifically about the kinds of accommodations available and whether the university permits substitutions. Do not assume that the college will provide the same services you received in high school. At the college level, waivers are typically not provided. Instead, many colleges offer a broader range of learning options and may possibly include a course substitution (such as taking classes in culture or literature in translation instead of a language).\nAsk whether the university has specific criteria you need to meet to qualify for foreign language accommodations and services. This is particularly important if you believe that you may need a substitution of the foreign language requirement. Typically, colleges request thorough documentation of your LD. In addition, some campuses will ask for any supporting documentation of your prior foreign language learning experiences in high school. Some service providers at campus disability support offices may not be able to tell you with certainty prior to admission whether a course substitution will be an approved accommodation for you. You are not getting the run around! Final decisions about whether a course substitution can be approved are often the decision of an academic committee. The service provider can tell you whether you are a good candidate for the substitution, general attitudes of foreign language faculty on campus, and what other accommodations and supports would be available to you.\nIf your LD impacts your foreign language learning, be an informed consumer. There is a wide range of services and supports at the college level. It is important that you prepare in high school and investigate programs that meet your specific needs in college. College access to foreign language learning is not \"one size fits all!\" Look at your performance and grades in foreign language classes in high school. Think about your interests and goals in attending college. Actively investigate the learning options available to you and weigh all the options based on your individual needs and learning profile.\nEditor's Note: Sally S.

Scott and Elaine Manglitz (1997)\nMaking the college transition\nMany individuals with learning disabilities experience difficulty in learning a foreign language. Is it any wonder? Learning disabilities (LD) often affect language-based tasks such as reading, spelling, writing, or listening. Problems in the native language will still be present, if not magnified, in the process of learning a second language system.\nResearch since the 1980's has supported the logical conclusion that there is indeed a link between native and foreign language learning. Results have shown that phonological difficulties (problems with tasks involving putting sounds together and pulling sounds apart in spoken and written language) and orthographic difficulties (problems with sound-symbol tasks in language) have the most immediate and severe impact on foreign language learning. These types of abilities are called on for such fundamental tasks as learning a new alphabet (e.g., Hebrew), a new sound-symbol system (e.g., spelling the nasal sounds in French) or the beginning vocabulary words of any new language. Other areas that have been found to affect foreign language learning include syntactic abilities (use and understanding of the grammatical rules of language), semantics (understanding word meaning and concepts), and short-term memory needed to acquire and practice new language demands.\nResearchers have also identified patterns in developmental history and academic learning that may correlate with later foreign language learning problems. Individuals with learning disabilities who have difficulty learning a foreign language often experienced difficulty or delay in learning to speak, received speech therapy early in their lives, or had a family history of language and learning problems. Academically, they may have had difficulty in learning to read, especially with learning phonics. Early difficulties with spelling and inconsistent use of grammar and mechanics are often part of the individual's learning history and frequently persist into adolescence and adulthood.\nAt the same time that research has been affirming the difficulties in foreign language learning of many students with learning disabilities, an increasing number of individuals with LD are attending college. Recent national figures show that 3-4 percent of all college freshmen identify themselves as having learning disabilities. How students with LD are meeting college foreign language requirements and what accommodations and services are available to them are still relative unknowns.\nCollege accommodations and services\nWith the increased focus in high schools and colleges on preparing students for life and work in a global society, students can expect that more colleges and universities will require the completion of foreign language courses for their degrees. Students with learning disabilities who attend college will find a continuum of services and choices related to foreign languages. Supports and services vary widely ranging from basic classroom and testing accommodations, to special sections of a language, to course substitutions. Although federal law requires colleges and universities to provide reasonable accommodations for students who have documented learning disabilities, the range of accommodations and modifications are determined by individual campuses.\nA survey done in the late 1980's showed that tutoring was the most frequently reported college service for foreign language support.

Schwarz (1997)\nForeign language study is an increasingly prominent part of education everywhere. Not only are high school students nearly always required to study a foreign language, but many lower and middle schools have added foreign languages to their curricula, whether as an enrichment or a requirement. Foreign language \"magnet\" schools have been created in some school districts and seem to be very popular. And of course, it's more common than not that colleges and universities require foreign language study for graduation. For the student unencumbered by a learning disability, foreign language study is indeed an enriching and rewarding experience. For the learning disabled student, however, it can be an unbelievably stressful and humiliating experience, the opposite of what is intended.\nWhile it has long been recognized in the learning disabilities field that foreign language study would be a terrific challenge to learning disabled students, somehow this fact has been widely ignored in the field of foreign language instruction and in schools in general until very recently. Teachers of ESL students have also recognized that there are students who have great difficulty mastering English because of learning disabilities. This fact has added some urgency to the need for recognition of this problem. As more research is being done and more teachers are recognizing the problem, more solutions are being created for the student facing the challenge of learning a foreign or second language and the teachers who teach them.\nWhat causes this difficulty?\nThe field of second language acquisition has historically blamed language learning failure on a number of factors. Anxiety in the foreign language classroom (anxiety about making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, about understanding the teacher, about remembering vocabulary) has been prominent as a purported cause of the failure. Among other causes cited in the literature have been lack of effort, lack of motivation, poor language learning habits and low \"ability\" in language learning. In the late 1960's, Dr. Kenneth Dinklage of Harvard University was compelled to find out why some of Harvard's brightest and best were not passing their language classes. He quickly dismissed lack of effort, seeing that most of these students were putting other courses and their degrees at major risk by devoting unusual amounts of time and effort to their language classes. Similarly, lack of motivation was not a cause, as these students could not graduate without completion of their language requirement. As for anxiety, he realized that the students were coming to see him because they were suffering from extreme anxiety as a result of not being able to pass their language classes. Since most of these students had never failed a class before, he felt that anxiety had not originally played a part in their failure.\nWhen he interviewed these students, Dinklage found that a number of the failing language students had in fact been diagnosed as learning disabled and had overcome their disability through good tutoring and very hard work; still, the foreign language course had triggered the problems the students thought were behind them. Others in the group, Dinklage found after testing, had previously undiagnosed learning disabilities; again the problems had not shown up until foreign language classes were attempted. The third part of the group, he felt, had a \"language learning disability,\" though Dinklage could not find the usual evidence of problems in testing. Clearly these students were unable to be successful in their foreign language study while at the same time they were excellent students in their other classes. He could find no other explanation. Then, in a kind of experiment years ahead of its time, he arranged for a graduate student who had a learning disabled sibling to teach Spanish to some of these struggling Harvard students using methods of instruction known to be helpful to those with learning disabilities. The students taught in this way were mostly able to pass the exams necessary to complete the foreign requirement.\nThus nearly 30 years ago, Dr. Dinklage pinpointed most of the basic ideas and principles relating to foreign languages and learning disabilities: The problem was related to being learning disabled, not to lack of motivation or effort or to anxiety by itself. Anxiety was the result of failure not the cause. Students not previously diagnosed as LD showed up as LD in the foreign language classroom. The learning disability had to be addressed in educational measures taken. Once the LD issues were addressed, the students could learn.\nLeonore Ganschow of the University of Miami, Ohio, and Richard Sparks of Mt. St. Joseph's College, both college psychologists who had numerous students referred to them because of problems in foreign language classes, began in the 1980's to look more closely at Dinklage's observations. In their research, they formulated a theory which explained the problems and variations in foreign language acquisition. An extension of earlier research on foreign language acquisition in which language is described as having component parts or linguistic codes, (phonological, semantic and syntactic), Ganschow and Sparks' Linguistic Coding Deficit Hypothesis (LCDH), states that difficulties with foreign language acquisition stem from deficiencies in one or more of these linguistic codes in the student's native language system. These deficiencies result in mild to extreme problems with specific oral and written aspects of language. Their view is that most learners experiencing difficulty with foreign language learning have problems with \"phonological awareness\". That is , they have trouble with the basic sound units of language, phonemes, and do not recognize or otherwise manipulate these basic units of sound efficiently. As a result, the student may have difficulty with the actual perception and production of language necessary for basic comprehension, speaking and spelling, or with language comprehension, which may affect understanding and/or production of language on a broader scale. According to their theory, excellent language learners are strong in all three of the linguistic codes, and conversely, very poor language learners are weak in all three. In between, however, are students who may be quite glib and able to do conversational language, but who have great difficulty with grammar and writing in the new language, or the opposite kind of student who perhaps reads and writes fairly well, but cannot speak with a good accent in the foreign language or cannot understand very much of what is spoken to him or her. These difficulties, the researchers say, spring from deficits in the native language. That these problems may be overt or so subtle as to have been ignored was observed by Dinklage many years ago, and this fact contributes to the difficulty many experts and non-experts have in believing that the problem is in fact based in first language. How can a student be competent, sometimes very competent, in his first language and have difficulties with a new language, difficulties that are supposedly based in the first language? It is hard to accept.\nHow can learning disabled students be taught foreign languages?\nOnce they had pinpointed what they felt was the root of the foreign language learning problem, Ganschow and Sparks began investigating ways that learning disabled students could be helped to learn a foreign language. At least two approaches to foreign language instruction different from \"normal\" or traditional language instruction have emerged as being effective.\nThe first and most researched approach is a response to Ganschow and Spark's findings that many, if not most, students having trouble with foreign language acquisition have phonological deficits in their first language. Ganschow and Sparks theorized further that to help these students, the sound system of the target language must be very explicitly taught. In order to test this theory, Ganschow and Sparks collaborated with a high school Spanish teacher who had learned about the Orton-Gillingham method of teaching phonology, reading and spelling to very significantly learning disabled students. In this method, sounds are presented in a highly structured fashion with a great deal of visual, kinesthetic and tactile practice and input. The Spanish teacher, Karen Miller, has tested the effectiveness of teaching Spanish to learning disabled students using the Orton-Gillingham approach. The research on her students has shown quite conclusively that LD students taught Spanish in this way have been able to learn and retain it. Another collaborator, Elke Schneider, has had similar results teaching German to LD students.\nIn their studies on Karen Miller's students, Ganschow and Sparks found that by being taught phonological skills in one language, the students improved their phonological awareness in English also. This finding has led to a variation on the method of teaching phonology in the target language: teach the fundamentals of phonology in the student's native language before foreign language instruction begins. That is, students are taught to recognize phonemes, to decode, or read words, efficiently and to encode, or apply the sounds to the written language. Basically, they learn what language is and how its sounds and parts function. Application of this knowledge to the language they are trying to learn is the next step. This has proven an effective remediation as well. In fact, so strongly do Ganschow and Sparks believe this, they now recommend very strongly that such phonological skills be much more heavily stressed when children are learning to read. They feel students' reading and language skills will be much stronger, and future problems with foreign language acquisition will be headed off for many.\nThe second approach to language instruction which has been effective has been to adapt the foreign language courses according to principles of instruction known to be effective for LD students. This means making such changes as reducing the syllabus to the essential elements, slowing the pace of instruction quite considerably, reducing the vocabulary demand, providing constant review and incorporating as much visual/tactile/kinesthetic (i.e. multisensory) stimulation and support as possible. Many of these course adaptations were also responses to the specific complaints and requests of foreign language students having trouble in their classes. Furthermore, in some schools there are courses designed for the student strong in listening and speaking skills but weak in reading and writing, and vice versa. The University of Colorado at Boulder has shown this latter approach to be effective in Latin and Spanish courses adapted for LD students. A phonological component is part of this adapted curriculum.\nWhat if these instructional conditions can't be met?\nWhile it is good news that the underlying cause of problems with foreign language learning has been tentatively identified and that ways have been found to teach LD students foreign language, two major problems remain. The first is that it is relatively rare that a school can, or more importantly, is willing to, devote an entire foreign language section or class to LD students. The second is that finding teachers trained to teach foreign language to LD students is even rarer. Most often in the real world, LD students find themselves in a classroom of so-called \"normal\" language learners. In this case, the students must rely on the willingness of the teacher to be inventive and flexible and on the school or school system itself to accommodate the student to the best of its ability and to the requirements of the law. As any LD student and his or her family will tell you, this is rarely a smooth process. It is almost equally painful when a teacher recognizes the needs of a particular student, but does not have the time or resources or support to be able to adequately accommodate that student, except to the degree the law requires.\nAs with any aspect of learning for any learning disabled student, no single solution is good for everybody. Stories abound of learning disabled students who have learned a foreign language one way or another. The question to be asked however, is what \"learned\" means. Students may become highly conversational with excellent accents and still be quite weak in grammar and in written language. Others may be very skilled readers of a foreign language and yet be virtually unable to converse in more than the most rudimentary phrases poorly pronounced. Still others may be fairly competent in all areas but never come close to attaining an accent that is close to \"native\" in the foreign language.\nConsequently, when a learning disabled student faces foreign language learning, a realistic assessment of the student's situation, problems and needs should be done. In other words, what the student may be able to do in a language and what the learning situation offers may not match at all. A student able to do oral language may be in a situation where passing grammar and translation tests is really what is required. Similarly, someone who reads and translates proficiently may be up against a teacher for whom pronunciation and conversation are of great importance. In cases such as these, \"reasonable accommodation\" may indeed mean providing a waiver and/or requiring a substitution. Some colleges are very inventive on the substitution issue. Catholic University in Washington, DC requires literature or history courses in cultures that are not based in romance languages. For example, students can study Middle Eastern culture or African or Chinese history or literature. Sometimes sign language is permitted as a substitution, though there is debate about that as a viable alternative to a foreign language.\nPolicies on waivers from foreign language requirements vary enormously. Every school has its own set of requirements. Some require full documentation of a learning disability with findings pointing to the deficits which are associated with foreign language learning problems; others might require a score on the Modern Language Aptitude Test ( MLAT). Unfortunately for the LD student, many schools, especially colleges, may require evidence of having attempted a foreign language and failed.\nThe path of the LD student facing a foreign language requirement is made even rougher by the fact that many schools lack personnel who are versed in the problems of foreign language difficulties for learning disabled students. Even prominent universities who boast of their accommodation of learning disabled and other handicapped students may be ignorant of this problem. Certainly, the foreign language departments are even more unaware of its existence. Students and families asking schools for accommodation on this issue need to be well-versed themselves and prepared to provide literature or at least reference to literature that will inform the school of this problem. Even better, when possible, parents or adult students should discuss the problem with a school before enrolling, to be sure that the problem can be dealt with. In one case, an LD student known to have such poor phonological skills that any oral foreign language study was out of the question, worked out an agreement with his school that he would become proficient in the reading of French if the school would accept that for his language requirement. Since he was a European history major and a brilliant student with excellent reasoning and memory skills, this seemed possible. Indeed, in a short time he was reading French texts quite comfortably and was well on his way to a reasonable compromise with his school of choice.\nOnce again, as with all things associated with learning disabilities, the answers are often complex and long-term, and everyone student's problem and solution is likely to be different. What is most important is that the problem of foreign language learning for the learning disabled be recognized for what it is and that the student be fairly and reasonably accommodated. Hopefully, as learning disabilities personnel, foreign language professionals and others become more aware of the research and literature, the path for the LD student facing foreign language requirements will become smoother.\n"}, {"score": 1772.4257, "uuid": "8ea2d21f-28a1-5098-a573-841171da89fa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-85-07928", "target_hostname": "www.ldonline.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ldonline.org/article/6065", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Learning</em> Disabilities and <em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> | LD Topics | LD OnLine", "snippet": "Even <em>better</em>, when possible, parents <em>or</em> <em>adult</em> students should discuss the problem with <em>a</em> school before enrolling, to be sure that the problem can be dealt with.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learning Disabilities and Foreign Language Learning\nBy: Robin L. Schwarz (1997)\nForeign language study is an increasingly prominent part of education everywhere. Not only are high school students nearly always required to study a foreign language, but many lower and middle schools have added foreign languages to their curricula, whether as an enrichment or a requirement. Foreign language \"magnet\" schools have been created in some school districts and seem to be very popular. And of course, it's more common than not that colleges and universities require foreign language study for graduation. For the student unencumbered by a learning disability, foreign language study is indeed an enriching and rewarding experience. For the learning disabled student, however, it can be an unbelievably stressful and humiliating experience, the opposite of what is intended.\nWhile it has long been recognized in the learning disabilities field that foreign language study would be a terrific challenge to learning disabled students, somehow this fact has been widely ignored in the field of foreign language instruction and in schools in general until very recently. Teachers of ESL students have also recognized that there are students who have great difficulty mastering English because of learning disabilities. This fact has added some urgency to the need for recognition of this problem. As more research is being done and more teachers are recognizing the problem, more solutions are being created for the student facing the challenge of learning a foreign or second language and the teachers who teach them.\nWhat causes this difficulty?\nThe field of second language acquisition has historically blamed language learning failure on a number of factors. Anxiety in the foreign language classroom (anxiety about making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, about understanding the teacher, about remembering vocabulary) has been prominent as a purported cause of the failure. Among other causes cited in the literature have been lack of effort, lack of motivation, poor language learning habits and low \"ability\" in language learning. In the late 1960's, Dr. Kenneth Dinklage of Harvard University was compelled to find out why some of Harvard's brightest and best were not passing their language classes. He quickly dismissed lack of effort, seeing that most of these students were putting other courses and their degrees at major risk by devoting unusual amounts of time and effort to their language classes. Similarly, lack of motivation was not a cause, as these students could not graduate without completion of their language requirement. As for anxiety, he realized that the students were coming to see him because they were suffering from extreme anxiety as a result of not being able to pass their language classes. Since most of these students had never failed a class before, he felt that anxiety had not originally played a part in their failure.\nWhen he interviewed these students, Dinklage found that a number of the failing language students had in fact been diagnosed as learning disabled and had overcome their disability through good tutoring and very hard work; still, the foreign language course had triggered the problems the students thought were behind them. Others in the group, Dinklage found after testing, had previously undiagnosed learning disabilities; again the problems had not shown up until foreign language classes were attempted. The third part of the group, he felt, had a \"language learning disability,\" though Dinklage could not find the usual evidence of problems in testing. Clearly these students were unable to be successful in their foreign language study while at the same time they were excellent students in their other classes. He could find no other explanation. Then, in a kind of experiment years ahead of its time, he arranged for a graduate student who had a learning disabled sibling to teach Spanish to some of these struggling Harvard students using methods of instruction known to be helpful to those with learning disabilities. The students taught in this way were mostly able to pass the exams necessary to complete the foreign requirement.\nThus nearly 30 years ago, Dr. Dinklage pinpointed most of the basic ideas and principles relating to foreign languages and learning disabilities: The problem was related to being learning disabled, not to lack of motivation or effort or to anxiety by itself. Anxiety was the result of failure not the cause. Students not previously diagnosed as LD showed up as LD in the foreign language classroom. The learning disability had to be addressed in educational measures taken. Once the LD issues were addressed, the students could learn.\nLeonore Ganschow of the University of Miami, Ohio, and Richard Sparks of Mt. St. Joseph's College, both college psychologists who had numerous students referred to them because of problems in foreign language classes, began in the 1980's to look more closely at Dinklage's observations. In their research, they formulated a theory which explained the problems and variations in foreign language acquisition. An extension of earlier research on foreign language acquisition in which language is described as having component parts or linguistic codes, (phonological, semantic and syntactic), Ganschow and Sparks' Linguistic Coding Deficit Hypothesis (LCDH), states that difficulties with foreign language acquisition stem from deficiencies in one or more of these linguistic codes in the student's native language system. These deficiencies result in mild to extreme problems with specific oral and written aspects of language. Their view is that most learners experiencing difficulty with foreign language learning have problems with \"phonological awareness\". That is , they have trouble with the basic sound units of language, phonemes, and do not recognize or otherwise manipulate these basic units of sound efficiently. As a result, the student may have difficulty with the actual perception and production of language necessary for basic comprehension, speaking and spelling, or with language comprehension, which may affect understanding and/or production of language on a broader scale. According to their theory, excellent language learners are strong in all three of the linguistic codes, and conversely, very poor language learners are weak in all three. In between, however, are students who may be quite glib and able to do conversational language, but who have great difficulty with grammar and writing in the new language, or the opposite kind of student who perhaps reads and writes fairly well, but cannot speak with a good accent in the foreign language or cannot understand very much of what is spoken to him or her. These difficulties, the researchers say, spring from deficits in the native language. That these problems may be overt or so subtle as to have been ignored was observed by Dinklage many years ago, and this fact contributes to the difficulty many experts and non-experts have in believing that the problem is in fact based in first language. How can a student be competent, sometimes very competent, in his first language and have difficulties with a new language, difficulties that are supposedly based in the first language? It is hard to accept.\nHow can learning disabled students be taught foreign languages?\nOnce they had pinpointed what they felt was the root of the foreign language learning problem, Ganschow and Sparks began investigating ways that learning disabled students could be helped to learn a foreign language. At least two approaches to foreign language instruction different from \"normal\" or traditional language instruction have emerged as being effective.\nThe first and most researched approach is a response to Ganschow and Spark's findings that many, if not most, students having trouble with foreign language acquisition have phonological deficits in their first language. Ganschow and Sparks theorized further that to help these students, the sound system of the target language must be very explicitly taught. In order to test this theory, Ganschow and Sparks collaborated with a high school Spanish teacher who had learned about the Orton-Gillingham method of teaching phonology, reading and spelling to very significantly learning disabled students. In this method, sounds are presented in a highly structured fashion with a great deal of visual, kinesthetic and tactile practice and input. The Spanish teacher, Karen Miller, has tested the effectiveness of teaching Spanish to learning disabled students using the Orton-Gillingham approach. The research on her students has shown quite conclusively that LD students taught Spanish in this way have been able to learn and retain it. Another collaborator, Elke Schneider, has had similar results teaching German to LD students.\nIn their studies on Karen Miller's students, Ganschow and Sparks found that by being taught phonological skills in one language, the students improved their phonological awareness in English also. This finding has led to a variation on the method of teaching phonology in the target language: teach the fundamentals of phonology in the student's native language before foreign language instruction begins. That is, students are taught to recognize phonemes, to decode, or read words, efficiently and to encode, or apply the sounds to the written language. Basically, they learn what language is and how its sounds and parts function. Application of this knowledge to the language they are trying to learn is the next step. This has proven an effective remediation as well. In fact, so strongly do Ganschow and Sparks believe this, they now recommend very strongly that such phonological skills be much more heavily stressed when children are learning to read. They feel students' reading and language skills will be much stronger, and future problems with foreign language acquisition will be headed off for many.\nThe second approach to language instruction which has been effective has been to adapt the foreign language courses according to principles of instruction known to be effective for LD students. This means making such changes as reducing the syllabus to the essential elements, slowing the pace of instruction quite considerably, reducing the vocabulary demand, providing constant review and incorporating as much visual/tactile/kinesthetic (i.e. multisensory) stimulation and support as possible. Many of these course adaptations were also responses to the specific complaints and requests of foreign language students having trouble in their classes. Furthermore, in some schools there are courses designed for the student strong in listening and speaking skills but weak in reading and writing, and vice versa. The University of Colorado at Boulder has shown this latter approach to be effective in Latin and Spanish courses adapted for LD students. A phonological component is part of this adapted curriculum.\nWhat if these instructional conditions can't be met?\nWhile it is good news that the underlying cause of problems with foreign language learning has been tentatively identified and that ways have been found to teach LD students foreign language, two major problems remain. The first is that it is relatively rare that a school can, or more importantly, is willing to, devote an entire foreign language section or class to LD students. The second is that finding teachers trained to teach foreign language to LD students is even rarer. Most often in the real world, LD students find themselves in a classroom of so-called \"normal\" language learners. In this case, the students must rely on the willingness of the teacher to be inventive and flexible and on the school or school system itself to accommodate the student to the best of its ability and to the requirements of the law. As any LD student and his or her family will tell you, this is rarely a smooth process. It is almost equally painful when a teacher recognizes the needs of a particular student, but does not have the time or resources or support to be able to adequately accommodate that student, except to the degree the law requires.\nAs with any aspect of learning for any learning disabled student, no single solution is good for everybody. Stories abound of learning disabled students who have learned a foreign language one way or another. The question to be asked however, is what \"learned\" means. Students may become highly conversational with excellent accents and still be quite weak in grammar and in written language. Others may be very skilled readers of a foreign language and yet be virtually unable to converse in more than the most rudimentary phrases poorly pronounced. Still others may be fairly competent in all areas but never come close to attaining an accent that is close to \"native\" in the foreign language.\nConsequently, when a learning disabled student faces foreign language learning, a realistic assessment of the student's situation, problems and needs should be done. In other words, what the student may be able to do in a language and what the learning situation offers may not match at all. A student able to do oral language may be in a situation where passing grammar and translation tests is really what is required. Similarly, someone who reads and translates proficiently may be up against a teacher for whom pronunciation and conversation are of great importance. In cases such as these, \"reasonable accommodation\" may indeed mean providing a waiver and/or requiring a substitution. Some colleges are very inventive on the substitution issue. Catholic University in Washington, DC requires literature or history courses in cultures that are not based in romance languages. For example, students can study Middle Eastern culture or African or Chinese history or literature. Sometimes sign language is permitted as a substitution, though there is debate about that as a viable alternative to a foreign language.\nPolicies on waivers from foreign language requirements vary enormously. Every school has its own set of requirements. Some require full documentation of a learning disability with findings pointing to the deficits which are associated with foreign language learning problems; others might require a score on the Modern Language Aptitude Test ( MLAT). Unfortunately for the LD student, many schools, especially colleges, may require evidence of having attempted a foreign language and failed.\nThe path of the LD student facing a foreign language requirement is made even rougher by the fact that many schools lack personnel who are versed in the problems of foreign language difficulties for learning disabled students. Even prominent universities who boast of their accommodation of learning disabled and other handicapped students may be ignorant of this problem. Certainly, the foreign language departments are even more unaware of its existence. Students and families asking schools for accommodation on this issue need to be well-versed themselves and prepared to provide literature or at least reference to literature that will inform the school of this problem. Even better, when possible, parents or adult students should discuss the problem with a school before enrolling, to be sure that the problem can be dealt with. In one case, an LD student known to have such poor phonological skills that any oral foreign language study was out of the question, worked out an agreement with his school that he would become proficient in the reading of French if the school would accept that for his language requirement. Since he was a European history major and a brilliant student with excellent reasoning and memory skills, this seemed possible. Indeed, in a short time he was reading French texts quite comfortably and was well on his way to a reasonable compromise with his school of choice.\nOnce again, as with all things associated with learning disabilities, the answers are often complex and long-term, and everyone student's problem and solution is likely to be different. What is most important is that the problem of foreign language learning for the learning disabled be recognized for what it is and that the student be fairly and reasonably accommodated. Hopefully, as learning disabilities personnel, foreign language professionals and others become more aware of the research and literature, the path for the LD student facing foreign language requirements will become smoother.\n"}, {"score": 1770.2074, "uuid": "a5fcf70d-c9ec-5f2e-9958-5133b27b61a3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-75-14585", "target_hostname": "www.ldonline.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ldonline.org/article/6065/", "page_rank": 1.2195369e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Learning</em> Disabilities and <em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> | LD Topics | LD OnLine", "snippet": "Even <em>better</em>, when possible, parents <em>or</em> <em>adult</em> students should discuss the problem with <em>a</em> school before enrolling, to be sure that the problem can be dealt with.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learning Disabilities and Foreign Language Learning\nBy: Robin L.

Let us help you set the record straight on the benefits of learning languages young.\n1. Being bilingual from an early age significantly alters the brain's structure.\nFACT! In recent brain research, scientists have discovered that bilingual adults have developed denser gray matter (brain tissue packed with information-processing nerve cells and fibers) in the brain\u2019s left hemisphere, where most language and communication skills are controlled.\nThe effect is strongest in people who learned a second language before the age of five and in those who are most proficient at their second language. This finding suggests that being bilingual from an early age significantly alters the brain\u2019s structure.\nReference: Society of Neuroscience, \"Brain Briefings\u201d September 2008, The Bilingual Brain\nWhile new language learning is easiest by age 7, the ability markedly declines after puberty. \"We're seeing the brain as more plastic and ready to create new circuits before than after puberty,\" according to Dr. Patricia Kuhl. As an adult, \"It's a totally different process. You won't learn it in the same way. You won't become (as good as) a native speaker.\"\nReference: Unraveling How Kids Become Bilingual\u00a0So Easily\n2. I don't speak Spanish. If I try to help my child with Spanish at home and mispronounce words, I will do more harm than good.\nMYTH! Exposure to native speakers in class will outweigh your less-than-perfect accent, but nothing can replace the enthusiasm and support you show for language learning at home!\nMany people in bilingual communities or homes need to speak to their child (at least some of the time) in a language which is not their native language. There is nothing at all wrong with doing this. Language shift (moving to a language which is not the language of your ancestry) is a normal part of human behavior. Some parents worry that they will pass on an \"incorrect\" accent to their children. Don't worry about this.\nOnce children start mixing with other children (from the age of 2 or 3) they start to learn their accent from their friends. Parents soon discover that they are not the model for their children's language behavior, any more than they are the model for their sense of fashion. Children acquire the language of the community where they live. Be prepared for this\u2014you might not like it!\nReference: Deborah D.K. Ruuskanen, Professor of English Linguistics at the University of Vaasa, Finland, and mother of three bilingual children.\nNot knowing a language perfectly well and having an accent in it is not a reason for not speaking that language to a child. Note also that many families who have changed linguistic regions or countries, and have to help their children who are schooled in another language, often do not have perfect knowledge of the outside language.\nIt is very important for children to receive as much exposure as possible to each language.\nReference: Professor Francois Grojean - Professor Emeritus and former Director of the Language and Speech Processing Laboratory at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland.\n3. If we start now and my child is not able to continue, he will lose everything he learns.\nMYTH!\"Use it or lose it\" is a myth. Like getting on a bike after many years, the skills come back with practice. A child will retain the ear, native-like accent, and ability to learn again at an accelerated pace when returning to language learning later.\nA student re-learning a language more formally later in life will have retained the ability to speak with a native accent, the meta-linguistic knowledge and the language learning strategies, even if he or she needs a refresher on specific vocabulary and grammar.\n4. Starting a language young will enhance literacy development in the first language.\nFACT! Learning a second language young actually improves reading abilities and general literacy in the first language.\nEarly language learning builds \"meta\" language skills\u2014a broader understanding of the uses of language as a whole, increased ability to integrate and retain new vocabulary, and increased ability to interact with symbolic systems such as print.\nThere is a correlation between second language learning and increased linguistic awareness. A study by the ACTFL aimed to validate the effects of second language learning on children's linguistic awareness. The results showed an advantage for the children who attended bilingual classes since kindergarten: they were better at grammatical judgment and correction tasks and word recognition.\nReference: Demont, E. (2001). Contribution of early 2nd-language learning to the development of linguistic awareness and learning to read. International Journal of Psychology, 36(4), 274-285. from PsycINFO database.\nIn comparing 9- to 10-year-old bilinguals to English monolinguals on tasks in English, the bilingual skilled readers scored higher on word-reading and spelling tasks than the monolingual skilled readers.\nReference: D'Angiulli, A., Siegel, L. S., & Serra, E. (2001). The development of reading in English and Italian in bilingual children. Applied Psycholinguistics, 22(4), 479-507. from PsycINFO database.\nThere is also a correlation between young children\u2019s second language development and the development of print awareness. Three groups of 4- and 5-year-old children were examined for their concepts of how print refers to language. Bilingual children understood better than monolingual children the general symbolic representation of print. The older Chinese-English bilingual children also showed advanced understanding of the specific correspondence relations in English print.\nReference: Bialystok, E. (1997). Effects of bilingualism and biliteracy on children's emerging concepts of print. Developmental Psychology, 33(3), 429-440. from PsycINFO database.\nThe study of foreign languages has also been shown to have positive effects on memory and listening skills. While children are developing the ability to communicate in a different language system, they also learn to see language as a phenomenon in itself. Children become aware that language and its objects are independent of one another, and that there are many ways in which to refer to one object. This may also be the reason why language learning skills transfer from one language learning experience to another. Knowledge of one foreign language facilitates the study of a second foreign language (Curtain & Pesola, 1988).\n5. My child will be delayed in his first language if he learns a second language too young.\nMYTH! Children are NOT delayed in overall language development when learning a second language young. Research shows that a child who is exposed early in life to two languages achieves each and every milestone on the same timetable as the other language\u2014and also on the same overall timetable as a monolingual child.\n\"In looking at that literature, I was surprised by claims being made about the developing child being exposed to two languages,\" says Dr. Laura-Ann Petitto of Dartmouth College. \"What was claimed is that very early exposure to two languages caused the child to be developmentally delayed in language, language confused, to mix the two languages. Strong attributions were made that these children were fundamentally confused.\n\"Implicit in that is a notion about the brain that didn't seem to be plausible. If that were true, it would almost have to be that you and I have brains that were neurologically set for one language\u2014wired to be monolingual. Then bilingualism is some kind of assault, some deviation where the brain has to limp along, and eventually tolerates two languages. So, I changed that into a testable hypothesis about the development of young bilingual children. I examined very young bilingual children, and asked, \"Well, ARE they language delayed?\" Through a series of studies over a period of ten years, we mapped out the milestones for young children acquiring two languages\u2014and were quite surprised to find that they are not delayed at all. In fact, a child who's exposed early in life to two languages achieves each and every milestone on the same timetable as the other language\u2014and also on the same overall timetable as a monolingual child. There was no timing deviance. These children were acquiring language on the same developmental time course in each language.\"\nReference: From Interview: \"The Brain's Capacity to Learn Multiple Languages: Dr. Laura-Ann Petitto Discusses Her Work.\" Professor Laura-Ann Petitto is a cognitive neuroscientist teaching at Dartmouth College, where she also serves as Director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory for Language & Child Development in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Education.\n6. Children who learn another language young demonstrate better focus and multitasking skills.\nFACT! Research shows that multilinguals have enhanced memory, planning, and multi-tasking skills. When learning multiple languages young, the brain is trained to attend to salient information and to disregard non-pertinent information, a skill that later supports better focus, memory, planning and multitasking abilities.\nReference: research at ACTFL (American Council on the teaching of Foreign Languages)\n7. Mandarin is no harder to learn than Spanish.\nFACT! New brains are \"equipped with the ability to pick up any language equally well. Infants and children learn the language that...is used with them in everyday life.\"\nReference: The Bilingual Edge, p.39, Alison Mackey, Kendall King.\nInfants' initial universal ability to distinguish between phonetic units must eventually give way to a language-specific pattern of listening. In Japanese, the phonetic units \u2018r\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 are combined into a single phonemic category (Japanese \u2018r\u2019), whereas in English, the difference is preserved (\u2018rake\u2019 and \u2018lake\u2019); similarly, in English, two Spanish phonetic units (distinguishing \u2018bala\u2019 from \u2018pala\u2019) are united in a single phonemic category. Infants can initially distinguish these sounds, and Werker and colleagues investigated when the infant \"citizens of the world\" become \"culture-bound\" listeners. They showed that English-learning infants could easily discriminate Hindi and Salish sounds at 6 months of age, but that this discrimination declined substantially by 12 months of age. English-learning infants at 12 months have difficulty in distinguishing between sounds that are not used in English.\nReference: Early Language Acquisition: Cracking the Speech Code, Patricia K. Kuhl, Nature Reviews. Neuroscience. Volume 5. November 2004. 831.\n8. My child has videos and CDs. He doesn't need a language class.\nMYTH! Research shows that personal interaction improves sound acquisition and vocabulary much more than TV or CDs alone.\nNine-month-old American babies who played games with and were read to by Mandarin speakers could still hear Mandarin phonemes at 14 months after only a dozen 25-minute Mandarin sessions. A control group could not. Babies who were exposed to videotaped Mandarin could not.\nReference: Early Language Acquisition: Cracking the Speech Code, Patricia K. Kuhl, Nature Reviews. Neuroscience. Volume 5. November 2004. 831.\nResearch clearly indicates that some activities are more effective than others in promoting second language acquisition and bilingualism. In particular, we know a growing amount about the limits of television and video as instructional aides with young children. For instance, recent studies have examined the process of perceptual narrowing in infants, that is, infants' gradual loss of the ability to perceive sounds unlike those in the language(s) to which they are regularly exposed. Researchers have found that live interaction (e.g., reading or talking to a child) is more effective than exposure to recorded sounds (e.g., television) in reversing the narrowing process (Kuhl, Feng-Ming, & Huei-Mei, 2003). Other studies have found that, for older children, being read aloud to in the second language increases second language vocabulary much more than watching television in that language (Patterson, 2002). In short, while audio and video materials can serve as a positive and entertaining source of support for language learning, human interaction is the best method for fostering both first and second language development.\n"}, {"score": 1694.9912, "uuid": "0d4aba32-d3d7-582c-97fc-242ae2f07da4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0808wb-15-09039", "target_hostname": "ricks.foreignpolicy.com", "target_uri": "http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/12/16/some_side_benefits_of_learning_both_a_foreign_language_and_a_foreign_culture", "page_rank": 1.2025192e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Some side benefits of <em>learning</em> both <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> and <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> culture", "snippet": "The man wrote <em>a</em> nice piece about how <em>learning</em> <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> and culture can help people, and you&#x27;re going mental.

Mark Jacobsen, USAF\nBest Defense guest columnist\nHere's a note from an Air Force pilot who is studying Arabic in Jordan.\nA few months ago I wrote up a list of secondary benefits that come with learning a foreign language, based on my own experience learning Arabic. It's a bit long, but I hope it will be of interest.\nHow to listen to other people's stories and perspectives. Being able to shut up and really listen to different opinions is a rare skill. If we want to make informed policy in cross-cultural contexts, we need to humanize and understand the \"other\" -- which includes both our allies and our enemies. We do not have to agree with each other, but we need to listen long enough to genuinely understand each other's narratives. Being in a foreign language environment forces you to concentrate and listen, especially because you probably lack the language skill to respond as you wish.\nHow to operate in an environment of constant uncertainty. When you arrive in a foreign culture, everything is uncertain. You feel a constant tightness in your chest because you don't know the rules for even the most trivial day-to-day tasks. Even something as simple as buying hummus and falafel or riding in a taxicab involves new processes, rituals, and vocabulary -- especially if you want to do it like the natives. You can't be a perfectionist, because you'll never get anything done otherwise. You learn to control negative emotional responses like fear, anger, or frustration. Fortunately, you do acclimate to this uncertainty. You learn to be patient, cool, and observant.\nHow to communicate without a solid common language. The lingua franca of the world is not English; it is broken English. This only gets people so far, and in many contexts they fall back on a variety of second mutual languages to communicate. It's common for a multiethnic group to shift from one language to another as they try to communicate a point. Learning to communicate in this fragmented, multilingual manner is an important skill in its own right.\nNot to take yourself too seriously. None of us like being made a fool of. But when you live in a foreign culture, there's no getting around it: you are the fool. You get ripped off. You make embarrassing cultural and linguistic mistakes. These experiences teach you to relax and to laugh at yourself. They teach humility. Anyone charged with crafting U.S. foreign policy should have a few of these experiences under his or her belt.\nThe limits of cross-cultural \"expertise.\" If you're wise, you come to disdain the word \"expert.\" I suppose there is such a thing as a cross-cultural expert, but few who claim the title really deserve it. It takes years -- probably decades -- of close work with another culture to really develop expertise. When you gain enough language to really penetrate the local culture, you realize how much is going on beneath the surface that you were previously blind to. You gain a healthy skepticism for reigning conventional wisdom about the culture.\nThe importance of local relationships. This is the corollary of the above point, and it is especially true if you can really immerse and avoid a supportive American network. You are utterly dependent on your local friends. This requires deep trust and humility, because you are constantly at their mercy. You quickly learn that you, as an American, are not the main actor in their country; you are a bewildered guest, and your success hinges on the strength and quality of your local relationships.\nHow to learn about culture and language. When you live in a foreign culture, you learn how to learn. You learn what vocabulary is important, what language learning techniques work, how to make relationships, what skills are important, what details to pay attention to. These skills will carry over to other languages and other cultures in the future.\nThe nature and unique dangers of translation. You learn that translation is not a mechanical science; it is an art. You learn what ideas translate directly and what do not. You gain an intuitive sense for the moment-by-moment decisions an interpreter must make, which can have serious impacts on the message. You learn how to communicate clear messages to an interpreter to increase the odds that they will be transmitted accurately.\nHow to speak clearly and directly. As a student of a second language, you learn a lot about communication. You learn to appreciate people who speak clearly, slowly, and in a direct way. You are frustrated by those who speak quickly and use lots of slang or jargon. As your ear gets attuned to these characteristics, you begin to analyze your own speech -- and the speech of other Americans -- when they speak English to non-native speakers. You gain a feel for when a message is being successfully transmitted, and when it's not.\nCapt Mark Jacobsen is a C-17 pilot and Olmsted scholar studying Arabic, Conflict Resolution, and Islamic History in Amman, Jordan.\nbgrimmni/flickr\n"}, {"score": 1688.5435, "uuid": "bae67f77-be0c-5d07-acda-578a51a13a06", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1111wb-95-21411", "target_hostname": "www.letutor.com", "target_uri": "http://www.letutor.com/category/how-to-learn-a-foreign-language/", "page_rank": 1.2082143e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "How to learn <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> |", "snippet": "When the going gets tough \u2013 When <em>language</em> <em>learning</em> becomes difficult <em>or</em> <em>a</em> chore students often give up <em>or</em> move on.

You do have to learn grammar eventually but music is absolutely key in learning languages. I speak seven languages and listening to lyrical music in these languages was fundamental to my being able to copy the melody of these languages and remember pronunciation and vocabulary. \u00a0The science of language learning shows that not only is the previously considered \u201ccritical period\u201d of language acquisition longer than previously thought but that multilingual people are \u201cmental jugglers\u201d. Music is a way to keep your language juggling fluid and natural.\nIt\u2019s so simple. Yet sometimes it feels like I am talking to the wall when I tell people how lyrical songs can help people learn language. \u00a0I\u2019ve given presentations about my book, Language Is Music , to the US State Department (the Foreign Ministry of the US), various universities and to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California and I got many dumbfounded looks from language teachers when I explained how to use songs to teach language.\nReally? I can use songs to teach grammar?\nYes.\nThe neurological links between language and music are vast but the basic thing to remember is that music activates more parts of the brain than language does, on both the right and left sides of the brain. So if you remember something to a tune, you are more likely to recall the information than if you just read it or heard it spoken.\nHave you ever heard a song on the radio that you haven\u2019t heard in a decade and you surprise yourself by singing all the lyrics?\nMusic and catchy jingles can stick in our minds for years while names of people, places,\u00a0 verb conjugation charts and memorized data disappear.\nExample:\nJust yesterday, I was writing an email to someone in Spanish and telling him that I needed to dust off my Thai cookbook to remember the recipe for Thai coconut milk soup for a Lunar New Year party with my friends. I\u2019d never used the word \u201cdust off\u201d in Spanish before, but I recalled it from the song \u201cAunque no est\u00e9 de moda\u201d by Silvio Rodriguez, where the singer says:\n\u201cDesempolvemos algo las pasiones lejanas\u00a0algo de aquellos sue\u00f1os sin ventanas.\u201d\n(Let us dust off something from our distant passions,something of those windowless dreams).\nMy words about Thai coconut milk soup were not as poetic or romantic as the words from the song, but it was my memory of the song lyrics that made me think of the word \u201cdesempolvar\u201d in Spanish.\nMusic makes the puzzle of a foreign language come together\nWhat happens when you hear something in a song is that you are opening yourself up to the greater global picture of the language. Then when you learn what the words mean by using a dictionary or reading the translation of the lyrics or just guessing from the context, you are putting the puzzle of the language together. If you start with the puzzle pieces (grammar rules, conjugation charts, vocabulary lists, etc), you may end up using those puzzle pieces as a sleeping pill rather than as means to learning the language. Let yourself breathe in the language with music so you can get a rhythmic introduction to the language.\nMusic wakes up your brain to remember words\nSongs are awakening the language capacity of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords who suffered brain damage caused by a bullet that passed through the left side of her brain, causing her to lose expressive speech. As you can see in this ABC News special report about her recovery,\u00a0 songs are helping the former Arizona Congresswoman regain her speech.\nAs the Nightline Special says, \u201cWhen the music fades away, the words stay\u201d. After listening to songs, Representative Giffords remembers the words from songs that she previously could not say. The music activates her memory of the words and ability to pronounce them.\nIf songs can help someone with brain injuries regain speaking abilities, then music can help everyone else learn languages. No more excuses!\nTips on listening and using music to learn languages\n1. \u00a0LISTEN then talk\nWatch this video to understand the fundamentals of how to listen to a foreign language to learn. This five minute video can save you many hours of painful work later on to polish your accent. If you listen first to your target language, before speaking, you have a better chance of having good pronunciation. If you launch into speaking from Day One, you are likely to be speaking with a poor accent and it will be hard to rewire your brain later on to produce different sounds after you may have solidified your speaking patterns.\nThere\u2019s a reason we have two ears and one mouth. Listen first, speak later, then learn the grammar and write.\nDon\u2019t rush into speaking. Learn the sounds of your languages first.\nIt does not matter if at first you do not understand. You may start singing along without even knowing what you are singing. You are not only learning the rhythm of the language, you are learning new vocabulary.\nRelax and close your eyes. Turn off the lights. Lie down, sit in a comfortable position or play. At first, don\u2019t try to understand the words, just listen. Your mind needs to be calm in order to absorb the sounds. Your ears need no other distractions to properly hear all the high, medium and low frequencies of the language. Do this regularly.\nAcademic proof of why listening first makes sense\nDr. Paul Sulzberger, did his PhD thesis in linguistics in New Zealand about how people learn Russian . He had one group of students who got to listen to Russian speech before formally learning Russian. The other group had no exposure to Russian at all. Those who spent time listening to Russian before studying it, had an easier time than those who had no experience listening to the language when it came to recognizing individual words in speech when they were formally learning the language. Therefore, the exposure to listening to the language to pick up the melody and sound patterns before learning words and grammar was advantageous to the students. Listening is a major factor in language acquisition!\n2. \u00a0What kind of music?\nFind music in your target language that you like. Seriously, it\u2019s not uncommon to find language teachers who aren\u2019t familiar with contemporary music in the language they are teaching and play old songs that don\u2019t resonate to their student\u2019s ears. You have to like what they are listening to. It\u2019s best to find songs that tell a story so you can learn a story line. Stay away from music with profanity or inappropriate content.\n3. \u00a0Find You Tube videos\nGo on You Tube and find music in the target language that they like. Some videos even come with subtitles in the target language or in translation. Videos may also help you understand what the song is about. This is especially important for visual learners because they can see the story being told by the lyrics and better understand what the song is about and match their new vocabulary to the images on the screen.\n4. \u00a0Write the lyrics\nAfter listening to the song(s) several time to get used to its sounds and melody, students write the lyrics of the songs while listening. You will have to pause the music and rewind or repeat many times to get the words down. Some words will be hard to write because they may be idioms or slang that you haven\u2019t learned yet, but just write as much as they can understand. Compare the lyrics they noted down with the original song lyrics that you will provide them and see how well you were able to understand the song. Some CDs come with the lyrics inside the CD case. If you don\u2019t have them, look for them online on lyrics websites.\nResources\n"}, {"score": 1635.9111, "uuid": "5933bc53-1017-5780-bcdd-5020c54dd170", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1909wb-14-07691", "target_hostname": "www.yearlyglot.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yearlyglot.com/2010/10/dont-study-a-foreign-language/", "page_rank": 1.2916953e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Don\u2019t study <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em>!", "snippet": "You have to use it and practice it to get <em>better</em> and understand <em>a</em> <em>language</em>.

But this isn\u2019t a joke post, and it\u2019s not reverse-psychology. I\u2019m absolutely serious\u2026 if you\u2019re studying a foreign language, you need to stop.\nSurely you must think I\u2019m mad. A guy who says anyone can learn to speak a foreign language is telling people not to do it? Well\u2026 not exactly. I\u2019m not telling you not to learn\u2026 I\u2019m only telling you not to study.\nStop studying\nPeople study to pass tests. Students study in order to do well in school. New drivers study for their driving exam. A doctor studies an x-ray. An investigator studies a crime scene.\nIf you were paying close attention to that last paragraph, you will have noticed a pattern: people study for intense short-term results. When people study, they devote elevated, sometimes even intense amounts of attention to a particular topic with the specific intent of high short-term recall.\nBut that\u2019s not how we use language! You don\u2019t study for a conversation. You can\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be said. Okay, if you knew you were going to meet a football player, you might think you could study football vocabulary beforehand. But he doesn\u2019t want to talk about the rules of the game, or the position on the field\u2026 and when he changes to the more interesting subject to his opinion of instant-replay you\u2019ll already find that the words you learned in advance weren\u2019t helpful. But more importantly, whether your study helped or not, you will most likely forget those words soon afterwards.\nQuit making time to study a language. Stop cramming. Put an end to all that ridiculous memorization. Never use flash cards. Throw out those vocabulary lists. Seriously!\nAnd I know you hate all those things. I\u2019m certain that those are the details you dread about language learning anyway. So stop doing them!\nLearn instead\nThink about how you learned your native language. There weren\u2019t lists. You didn\u2019t have to study. You just learned the words that were important to the things you were doing \u2014 which usually meant learning the things you enjoy. So why not learn like that now?\nI can tell you that I have spent almost no time studying Italian this year. I\u2019m not lying. I do not study. I have not done any flashcards. None. And in spite of my post about frequency lists , I have not bothered to look at one or check off any words. If I had a particular word-count for a goal, I might do that\u2026 but I don\u2019t have any such goal. My goal is to communicate.\nIn spite of not studying I\u2019m learning just fine, and so can you. Here\u2019s what I am doing, and why (in spite of not studying) I\u2019m quite pleased with my progress in Italian:\nEvery night I read at least one chapter of a book written in Italian. In the beginning, that was a simple reader, but I am currently reading Pinocchio in the original Italian, and thoroughly enjoying it. In the earlier chapters I had to look up a lot of words as I read, but half-way through the book I am now reading almost uninterrupted. Often, I can figure out the meaning of a word from context, and I only have to look up one or two difficult words in a chapter.\nI only listen to music in Italian. Whether I\u2019m paying full attention or just listening passively (and I do both), the only music getting into my head this year is Italian music. And it\u2019s working. Instead of having Lady Gaga\u2019s latest hit stuck in my head, I\u2019m stuck repeating something in my target language. That helps more than you might imagine.\nWhen I want to watch recent movies, I try to find those movies in Italian. This isn\u2019t always possible, but if you know how to search and use torrents, you can find some pretty good films professionally dubbed in Italian. This is how I watched Iron Man 2, The Crazies, Green Zone, The Men Who Stare At Goats, Did You Hear About The Morgans, Robin Hood, and several others. Watching a movie is much more enjoyable than \u201cstudying\u201d, and if you\u2019re going to spend time being idly entertained, at least this way it counts toward your language goal.\nWhen writing an email or chatting with an Italian-speaker, I write only in Italian. Even if I don\u2019t know how to say something. Especially when I don\u2019t know how to say something! How else will I learn if I don\u2019t try it then? You only learn when you do the things you don\u2019t know. And since the moment I started learning Italian, I, too, am an Italian-speaker, so that includes any notes I write to myself. Figuring out how to say something when you write a note to yourself is a great way to save the stress of figuring it out when talking to someone else. A great place to do this is Lang-8 .\nAnd, perhaps the most helpful of all, I take the time to learn things (expressions, grammar, etc) as I write about them to explain them to you in my posts! When I write a 400-word post about Italian, it takes me several hours\u2026 not because I write slow, but because I spend time learning the things I\u2019m writing about and double-checking my information. And sometimes I still end up getting corrections in my comments. Learning this way keeps everything relevant to what I\u2019m doing (writing a blog) and it never feels like studying. When listening to a song, or watching a movie, or having a conversation with an Italian, when I hear a new expression, I write it down and learn it so I can share it later with you!\nAll of these things are compatible with having a normal life. When asked how much time I spend studying, I know that the question stems from the belief that I must have no life if I\u2019m learning a new language every year. But I have a life! I have plenty of time for everything because I\u2019m not adding any hassle to my schedule. I\u2019m simply replacing activities in English with activities in Italian. Once you get past basic grammar, it only takes a few moments to look up a word you don\u2019t know.\nSo my answer is\u2026 I don\u2019t study. And neither should you.\nWC\nI\u2019m really sick of people telling me to learn like a baby. I don\u2019t have 16 hours a day for 6 years to learn the minimum necessary bits of a language to get my point across. I certainly don\u2019t have the 12+ years it took me to be able to write essays and have intelligent conversation.\nSo I study. And I practice. And I use the language. Like an adult.\nSusan\nThis is the best information about learning a language that I\u2019ve ever read.\nhttp://www.fluentin3months.com/ Benny the language hacker\n\u201c16 hours a day for 6 years to learn the minimum\u201d WTF??\nWith 16 hours \u201ca day\u201d you\u2019d learn the minimum necessary bits before breakfast on day 1 and after a week you\u2019d be communicating pretty well if you were in learn-mode rather than study mode.\nI\u2019m also not a fan of saying \u201clearn like a baby\u201d since adults are SOCIAL creatures, but retorts like that just show how illogical the study-focused attitude is. People think that full time learning just means their current unbalanced study method times twenty. It\u2019s no wonder they think you have to be a genius to learn a language\u2026\nSteve\nI really enjoy study and as a result I retain most of it and use it so I don\u00b4t think everyone should stop studying. Different things work for different people. I agree with the other stuff you said and do it too but I also really enjoy studying and feel the benefits of it when talking, listening, reading etc.\nhttp://beyondbounds.org/ Jason Sharp\nReally great post. I personally think spending some time in Anki / with grammar does help, though using the language absolutely should be the focus. I don\u2019t see how WC got that you should use the language like a baby or that it\u2019ll take 16 hours for 6 years this way..\nTony\nI would disagree, boing both is the best thing, at least for me. I attempt to watch films, read articles and listen to music in my target language, and without a doubt it helps and is much more enjoyable than studying. Any words that I see frequently, I add to ANKI, and I spend at least 10-20 minutes a day going through my ever increasing ANKI word list. Since I discovered Anki, I\u2019m amazed at how fast I\u2019m able to learn words and phrases.\nBut studying is a must, even if it\u2019s a little. I will read up on grammar, do exercises and use books to practice writing and speaking in various different situations. Situations that I may never encounter, but it\u2019s practice and exposure non-the-less. I\u2019m certainly not studying to pass an exam, but I\u2019d like to understand what I\u2019m hearing, reading and speaking. Having a good balance between the two is important, I don\u2019t study too much that I get bored, but I study enough so that I make progress.\nI don\u2019t mean to sound critical, but after reading some of your earlier posts it seems like you are contradicting yourself. Didn\u2019t you learn hundreds of Russian phrases using Anki? Spending a few hours reading and then writing articles about grammar is also studying (Although in an unconventional way). I think \u201cStop Studying\u201d is far too much of a strong statement. I would say \u201cStudy less, and have more fun :-)\u201d. Find a balance that is right for you.\nAntje\nNow, that really feels creepy cause I have the impression you just\nlooked into my head! I spent 3 years in Spain when I was a child and\nobviously learned Spanish exactly this way. I spent a year in France\nstaying with a French family, never studied but nevertheless _learned_\nFrench. And now I live in Scotland and I really want to improve my\npoor English (I\u2019m German), so I read English books, only English books\nwhich I get from the local library \u2013 and as you said: In the beginning\nI looked up a lot of words but then my reading became more and more\nfluently \u2013 and I so enjoy that! I write English short messages,\nEnglish e-mail (English comments ;), watch English movies \u2013 and I\nenjoy it. That\u2019s exactly the way I love to learn a language \u2013 and it\nworks!\nExcellent! I can see that it has worked well for you.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nI have never used ANKI or any flashcards. Last year, I did try to learn from a frequency list, but I can tell you that what I learned from studying that list was slow and painful and didn\u2019t stick, whereas those same words, when I read them in a news article, stuck permanently in my mind. Without context around the word, you\u2019re memorizing. It\u2019s slow, and not very fun, and not very effective for recall.\nAnd regarding the grammar I learn as I write here, I don\u2019t think of that as study, because I read it, find a way to understand it, write about it, and then stop thinking about it. Study would seem to imply that I keep looking at it over and over\u2026 which I don\u2019t.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nI\u2019m seeing a lot of people mention Anki. Call me unconventional, but I just don\u2019t believe you can learn a language from flashcards.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nIf you enjoy study, then at least you\u2019re getting something out of it when you do it.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nThanks!\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nI can tell from your congenial response that you have absolutely no built up frustration on this topic.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nEveryone told me it would take seven years to learn fluent Russian. I did it in one. I can\u2019t help thinking that my method works. :)\n\u201cLearn like a baby\u201d is an ignorant thing to say, since we are not babies. But \u201clearn like a child\u201d actually makes sense, because children learn almost everything socially, and the average five-year-old in Spain speaks better Spanish than most adults I know.\nhttp://beyondbounds.org/ Jason Sharp\nRight right. I don\u2019t think using anki is absolutely essential as well (nor any flashcard program), as I didn\u2019t use one when I learned Chinese\u2026 although I did write down words and look at them occasionally. Language is for sure easier to learn (and sticks better / more motivating) when learned through use, although doing 20 minutes of Anki a day really does help.\nCheck out http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/ , he has some good posts on this, although I really don\u2019t agree with the overall Heisig method of first learning to read, then learning to pronounce. It\u2019s dull, robotic, and doesn\u2019t make sense in terms of how our minds piece together information.\nInstead of thinking about flashcards in the traditional boring way, perhaps you can try to think of Anki as a memory assistance program. The best part of Anki IMO isn\u2019t that it\u2019s flashcards, but rather the SRS part of it \u2013 outsourcing the review process to a program that can do it more efficiently than you can. You don\u2019t even have to just input words \u2013 you can input sentences too. It is nice having pre-built decks to learn from, but I do my learning outside of Anki (as you say), then use it to help me remember \u2013 very little effort to maintain it for life.\nAni\njust like you said, you practiced and used it. Thats what they say. You may study all you want but that not how you improve. You have to use it and practice it to get better and understand a language.\nToo me what they mean by studying like a child is you aren\u2019t worried about making mistakes and you choose what you want to watch, listen to, or read. have fun, like kids do. They dont learn grammar til in high school. At least where I grow up.\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nWhether you choose to call it \u201cmemory assistance\u201d or something else, it\u2019s still just flashcards, which means you\u2019re learning to memorize words out of their context. Not only do I think this is a terrible way to learn, but I also believe it creates problems for you later on.\nBottom line: Whether it\u2019s flashcards or frequency lists or any other arrangement of words in a list, if you\u2019re learning for the sake of increasing the number of words you know, you\u2019re already missing the point. If I was learning Italian for the purpose of musical study, I could learn every word I needed from just talking about musical study, and every additional word that I learned would be useful in that realm. But if I started reading vocabulary lists or doing flashcards, I would be spending valuable brainpower on things that I don\u2019t need and will never use.\n(Disclaimer: That\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m learning Italian. It just makes a good example.)\nTony\nDid you learn Russian the same way as you have been learning Italian? I\u2019d love to see a post summarizing how you learnt it to such a high-level in the course of a year (Maybe you already have posted, but I don\u2019t remember seeing it).\nAlthough as I wrote above, I do read and watch films in my target language, I\u2019m at a loss on how I\u2019d progess quicker without actually spending time studying books, learning vocab using Anki, etc. I\u2019m absolutely 100% for ditching the boring books and Anki :-)\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nThe same way? No. It was similar. While I wasn\u2019t writing the blog then, Russian was, essentially, my first \u201cfluent in one year\u201d project. So in addition to learning what works, I also learned a lot about what doesn\u2019t work.\nThere is a lot of grammar involved in Slavic languages, and the important thing was getting my head around all of that. No matter what language I\u2019m learning, I start early on with learning the grammar. Sure, I\u2019m not going to master it that way, but understanding the grammar gives me the ability to understand and learn from the things I\u2019ll see from then on.\nFortunately, there are only two verb tenses, and a few other really simple details, which lightens the burden when you\u2019re learning 6 noun cases in 3 genders.\nAnyway, the reason I was able to learn Russian well in a short period of time is because I was constantly using it. Since the beginning of the year, I was listening to mostly Russian music and very little else. I was watching movies and tv shows in Russian every few days. I was around Russian speaking people regularly. And I was chatting online with Russians every day.\nThat was all very overwhelming at first, but slowly as I learned, things began to make more sense. And by the end of the year, I was able to host a Christmas party for all of my Russian friends.\nI can argue with people all day about whether or not it helped to study the grammar\u2026 but nobody can deny that the intense level of immersion I created for myself was the biggest key to my success in Russian.\nAnonymous\ncould you please provide a bit more details on how you learn words, for example, while reading? when i find a new word in an article, look it up and try to learn it for a few seconds, it may not always stick. so then the next day when i find the same word i\u2019ll have to get the dictionary once again. i think it\u2019s quite a waste of time. (i haven\u2019t used anki yet, but i think it could be a possible solution for this. and anki doesn\u2019t necessarily mean learning lists of separate words \u2013 you can make a sentence list and therefore learn words in context.)\ndo you have the ability to learn most of the new words in a few seconds or half a minute, so that within a few days you would recognize them? if so, is there any technique that you use for quick memorisation, or is it natural for you :) if not, how do you deal with not having to look the words up more than once?\nhttp://www.yearlyglot.com/ Randy the Yearlyglot\nExcellent questions!\nFirst, my strategy isn\u2019t to learn every word. In general, writers use a vocabulary much bigger than speakers. In most cases, I\u2019m happy to figure out the meaning of a particular word from context, though if I\u2019m unclear I will look it up.\nI try to focus on words that are important to the theme of what I\u2019m reading, which I find isn\u2019t very hard, since they are repeated often. For example, when reading a book about personal finance, you\u2019ll see words like \u201csaving\u201d and \u201caccount\u201d and \u201cretire\u201d a lot. You may have trouble learning it on page 7, but by page 50 you\u2019re never going to forget those words.\nAs for remembering words, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m blessed with any special gift of memory. I just use what I know to help me with what I don\u2019t. For instance, two days ago I learned the Italian word for thumb is \u201cpollice\u201d, which sounds a lot like \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446, the Russian word for finger. So in spite of having never seen that word before, or again, I was able to look it up and then remember it permanently within a few seconds.\nThe same thing worked when I learned scocciare, whose verb stem sounds to me like the stem from the Russian verb \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c, and since the two mean similar things, I was again able to learn the word permanently withing a few seconds.\nObviously, that doesn\u2019t work for everything. And some words just aren\u2019t going to be learned that easily.\nBut there are usually ways to facilitate memory. Learning prefixes and suffixes, and deconstructing words tends to help a lot! An example from last week, I learned the word comportarsi, meaning how you treat others. I paused the conversation for a moment, and deconstructed the word \u2013 co=with, portare=carry, si=yourself. So the word means \u201cto carry yourself with\u201d, and that makes a lot of sense. \u201cNon comportarsi cos\u00ec\u201d = \u201cDon\u2019t carry yourself [with others] this way.\u201d\nI can see this is a great topic for a post.\nAnonymous\nthese are some great tips and examples!\nlooking up all the new words (sometimes up to 20-30 per page) was quite a tedious task. i used to think that it\u2019s a great opportunity to improve my vocabulary, but i just couldn\u2019t cope with it. now after reading your comment i\u2019m trying to go a different way \u2013 look up just the words which are essential for understanding the plot/story (some 3-5 words per page), and guess or even skip the rest. even though i will learn a smaller amount of words from that specific source, i will learn them better and the process will be more enjoyable (which is very important!) and less stressful.\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/jinxmontague Jinx\nFantastic post, Randy! I would love to share this with some people I know who are scared of learning languages and ask me \u201cHow can you do that much studying?\u201d I always reply, \u201cIt\u2019s not study, it\u2019s fun!\u201d but they don\u2019t seem to get it.

We spoke with Pi\u00f1a Madera* and Lisa Locklin**, two fabulous instructors who offer classes at our Concord Studio, to learn why children should learn a foreign language. Please read on for our Q & A with Pi\u00f1a and Lisa, and come back next week for part two!\nQ: Why do you think it is important to expose children to foreign languages?\nPi\u00f1a: There are so many good reasons to give kids a jump-start on learning multiple languages. Here are just a few:\nIt helps with language and literacy overall.\nIt exposes them to the notion that there are other places where people speak different languages (and as they get older you can naturally introduce new customs), and this opens their mind to things that are different, preparing them for a global reality.\nIt allows them to communicate with people they would otherwise never meet.\nIt increases their future career prospects.\nLisa: A second language enriches and enhances a child\u2019s mental development, and it has a positive effect on intellectual growth. It also leaves students with more flexibility in thinking, a greater sensitivity to language and culture, and a better ear for listening. Studies consistently show, for example, that students who are multilingual perform better on standardized tests.\nQ: What are the benefits of introducing children to foreign languages at an early age as opposed to later in life?\nPi\u00f1a: Research has shown that it is actually good for the brain\u2014improving test-taking, handling distraction, math, music and even delaying Alzheimer\u2019s for truly fluent bilinguals\nThe young brain is uniquely prepared to learn language in the early years. We traditionally introduce languages at the onset of puberty, when we are distracted, highly self-conscious, and risk-averse. Young children are not inhibited about making mistakes, or mispronouncing words, or sounding silly. Teens are. You will be sparing your future teen many embarrassing moments and arduous memorization if you teach them now.\nLisa: Children\u2019s brains are more \u201copen\u201d when younger\u2014they absorb things more quickly. A second language can bring them more confidence. And younger children can adopt a \u201cnative-like accent\u201d better than older children. Children understand intuitively that language is something to explore, have fun with and enjoy.\nQ: In your experience, what is the best way to get a child excited about learning a new language?\nPi\u00f1a: We have found that giving children language they can use, and conducting their favorite activities in the second language makes for an easy, satisfying transition. Music and silliness is always a great add when teaching kids anything. Incorporate tickling, if possible!\nLisa: By having fun with books, songs, games, attending multicultural events and role-playing.\u00a0 One of my favorite learning games is making a passport and \u201cflying\u201d to Paris for a visit.\nQ: What do you think is the hardest part of mastering a new language?\nPi\u00f1a: Finding a community to practice with can be hard, but worth the hard work. A community can inspire, encourage and help with what is a slow process.\nKnow, too, that kids develop language through relationships with a loving caregiver\u2026not through videos and apps. It\u2019s great to add media as a support, but studies show that language is learned from loving caregivers much more effectively than from media.\nLisa: For adults, an authentic accent becomes harder and harder as you age, and the nuance of humor is a very difficult aspect of learning a new language. But for a child, a foreign accent and joking is easy. For the youngest children, the hardest part of learning a language is not about the language, but about their ability to listen and focus on the class, and to participate.\nHave you ever tried to learn a foreign language?

As parents, we spend many months encouraging our little ones to utter their first words and begin their voyage through language. During the school years, teachers pound proper grammar into kids\u2019 heads. It usually is not until children reach the middle years of their schooling that they are potentially offered the opportunity to learn a second language. But, is it too late? What is the optimal age for learning a foreign language?\nThe Brain and Learning a Foreign Language\nThe brain learns in amazing ways. Our brains have many compartments that are in charge of different specialties, such as the left brain covering creativity and the frontal lobe taking care of solving problems. According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, learning occurs without intervention \u2013 and introducing a second language to youngsters can be effortless. They find that in the early stages of learning, \u201c neural circuits are activated piecemeal, incompletely, and weakly .\u201d With more experience, those circuits become hardwired and the learning becomes automatic.\nFor some children, learning a second language happens within the home, through parents, beginning at birth. Children raised in a bilingual environment often have a dominant language, or one that they excel in, that is most often spoken in their everyday life. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, it is never too early to introduce a child to a secondary language, and learning two languages will not cause any speech or language delay problems for children .\nIntroducing a Second Language\nFor those parents that are not versed in two languages, the educational system or personal tutors are looked upon to introduce another language. Even short bouts of intensive foreign language learning at the elementary level sets children up for a positive foreign language learning experience. There are several benefits for introducing young children to a foreign language, such as:\nThe earlier children begin learning a foreign language, the greater the foreign language skill set they obtain. Children that begin learning at an earlier age, and then continue the foreign language study in years to come, have a better chance of developing the secondary language at a higher level of proficiency .\nLearning a foreign language aides in keeping the brain healthy and boosting brainpower. Learning other languages alters grey matter in the brain, which processes information, just like how exercising creates healthy muscles. Those who learn languages earlier in life are more likely to have more advanced grey matter \u2013 meaning they will be better learners in general.\nAccording to Kathleen Marcos, writing for Kid Source, children that are exposed to learning a foreign language prior to the onset of adolescence are more likely to have a native-like pronunciation . Along with learning a secondary language, young children also gain important knowledge of other cultures, further broadening their outlook and appreciation of others.\nWhen to Start\nBut, what is the ideal age for learning a foreign language? It is hard to determine an exact number. Around the age of three, children are ripe for hearing and pronouncing, and are just beginning to grasp their native language. This makes it an ideal time to begin introducing a foreign language. Along with learning about their native language, hearing a foreign language and being encouraged to speak it, aides in the learning of both languages. But, do not expect too much. Take it slow and keep expectations low for a positive language-learning environment.\nStart by introducing children to music or television in a foreign language within a comfortable environment. Even though you may not think your child is gleaning any information, he is getting his ears used to hearing the language, which sets him up for future foreign language learning.\nIntroduce one word at a time. Most young children are not speaking in complete sentences yet, so it cannot be expected for them to learn a foreign language in the same way. While introducing the word to the child in their native language, say the word in the foreign language also , so the learning happens at the same time.\nTurn the learning into a game. Find fun ways to use the words for colors or shapes in a foreign language in your family\u2019s favorite game. The next time your child wants to play Bingo, say the letters or numbers in the foreign language and see if he can figure it out. Making learning fun encourages his future enjoyment of learning more of the secondary language.\nEncourage your child to teach the foreign language he is learning to the rest of the family. This gives your child the role of a foreign language teacher, encouraging his brain to reinforce learning, and the opportunity to practice the skills he has gained. It also boosts his confidence and speaking abilities.\nOlder Foreign Language Learners\nIf a foreign language is not introduced until a child is in his teenage years, he is still able to maximize his learning \u2013 with some additional help. Once your child has been introduced to foreign language within the school setting, help reinforce learning at home. Often, one short class a week in foreign language isn\u2019t enough to create concrete learning . Spending time with your child reinforcing his learning shares your desire to see his success in learning a secondary language, and offers an opportunity for some quality together time.\nIt is never too late to learn a foreign language. The adult brain is always ready for new information, and by using repetitive methods and immersion , the older brain is able to absorb new language learning just as well as a young child\u2019s.\nBy Sarah Lipoff.

My uncle (and aunt and cousins) was a missionary in Puerto Rico (later in Spain) and therefore spoke fluent Spanish. But when I reached 7th grade and had the opportunity to select a foreign language for study, after hearing all three or four teachers (German, Spanish, Italian, and French) give their 'pitch,' I chose French. Looking back, I'm not sure why, given the access I had to German and Spanich - I think I just liked it.\nCharlotte Mason taught French first, and many have rightly noted that it was an obvious first 'second language' by reason of geography. The parallel to the United States seems to be Spanish - a language that is commonly spoken in many parts of this country.\nHowever, I would encourage people to consider some other factors. Language study, IMHO, is not to be done purely for pragmatic reasons of how many people around you speak that language. I do not have a French community nearby, nor do I have French neighbors or a French televison station. However, my knowledge of French - first of all - has allowed me to begin to see through the eyes of another culture, and that is a crucial element of long-term foreign language study (not just saying things the way other people say them, but seeing things the way they see them). It makes it easier to transfer that to other cultures - once you've done it with one. I think this is an important but often neglected ingredient of foreign language study.\nSecondly, my knowledge of French has enhanced my knowledge of English. I see this now in my oldest daughter's education, as her knowledge of English grammar is at a significant level - which I attribute to her foreign language study. I think Charlotte Mason would agree with that.\nThirdly, my foundation of French has made the transition to learning additional languages (which is what Charlotte Mason advocated) much easier. I'm teaching my younger 2 children (8 and 5 yo) French, but my oldest (10th grade) is now also learning Koine Greek (New Testament Greek) and also Latin. We expect to add Spanish next year. We don't intend to learn each language to the same depth. French is the 'deepest', with us working on literature and grammar, as well as conversation. Greek is learned to have an appreciation for the original language of the New Testament and to aid in Bible study,and Latin is learned to ameloriate vocabulary skills in English. Spanish will be learned just to the level of basic conversation - much like a traveler's level. (I do see importance in Americans knowing some Spanish.) But I find that learning multiple languages is easier than most would think, once a foundational 'second language' is learned.\nFor each of these reasons, French is not the issue. It could be any language - but for us, French has worked well.\nThere is a final consideration in foreign language study that I think is important. We've addressed the pragmatism of learning one language over another, in order to get to use the language. That's great - and I support that. But I would challenge families to realize that it's a \"small world\" today - and access to many foreign languages is growing, not diminishing. But most important, it's not the particular foreign language that's important, it's the fact of learning a foreign language that is vital.\nWe have an issue in the United States right now in which only a handful of people in the CIA or the Pentagon, for instance, speak the languages of the area in which the enemy terrorists live. I think that may be attributable to the de-emphasis on foreign language in our schools in recent years (emphasizing math and science instead - so that we've got all these great computer skills, but we don't know how to understand another culture and worldview, and we don't have the skills to learn their languages). If someone learns one language somewhat 'deeply,' then learning additional pertinent or timely languages is much easier. We don't know what language our children may need to learn - as missionaries, as people in the military or government positions, or other situations. They may be languages we wouldn't even think of now - but foreign language study is more than being able to count in Spanish, French, or German - it's understanding how to learn a foreign language, and how to appreciate someone else's perspective.\nI guess what I'm saying is that I don't think one language is superior than another for a first 'second language' - I think it should be one that you stick with over a period of time, so that your child can learn it with some proficiency...and then the next language will be much easier.\nI've also read studies that say that children who learn foreign languages score significantly higher on achievement tests than even those who emphasize math and science. So there are lots of good reasons for language study!:-)\nLove in Christ, Donna-Jean Breckenridge\nFrench language ideas\nAs much as I have enjoyed PowerGlide French, it will only take one so far. What, then to do with a 2nd or 3rd year student of French? I have kind of turned French Studies into a hobby, so I thought I'd share some things with this group.\n1) I use as much french at home with my children as possible - using english words as needed. The more french we learn, the more we use.\n2) Great site for learning french. I signed up for the word a day, which comes with a pronunciation guide and the daily word is used in a couple of sentences. I particularly look for sentences that we can use often. (Nous devons franchir le fleuve! We have to cross the river! We do have to cross a river to get to town, so we use this sentence a lot. We then changed it to Nous pouvon... We can). http://french.about.com/index.htm?terms=French+Language\n3) Part of the site above, but focusing on french language study. http://french.about.com/cs/schools/index.htm?terms=French+Language\n4) Media links to french online newspapers, radio stations, etc. http://french.about.com/cs/newsandmedia/index.htm?terms=French+Language\n5) An on-line Who-Done-It in french... a teaching program. I recently found this one, and it looks interesting. Can't vouch for the quality, as I have not spent much time there. http://www.polarfle.com/pages/lecrimedeb.htm\n6) University of Calgary offers 4 french reading courses... I have only finished the 1st lesson of the 1st course so far, but have noticed a HUGE improvement in my french reading skills. The first lesson points out that about 1/2 of all words used are common, everyday words... like the, then, and, like, of, behind, because, for, etc. There are about 250 of these words, so we should learn them asap... make a list and keep it with you while reading... it's amazing how quickly these words are learned, and how much improvement in understanding there is. Highly recommended... I am just doing the course for myself and not for credit: http://fis.ucalgary.ca/RF/235Overview.html\n7) Lyric Language VCR tape - 10 songs, sung in both french and english (spanish version also available). My kids quickly learned these songs, and I hear them singing them when playing together. Good increase in vocabulary, but I would not use this as a stand-alone curriculum. Having said that, this is a great augmentation to PowerGlide. I would put Muzzy in this category also, although Muzzy is much less interesting, and less interactive. (Muzzy also comes in spanish. I would not spend the money for Muzzy, I'd buy a DVD player instead, and DVD's that have the language track of choice. Then your kids are watching movies they like, not just Muzzy over and over, which my kids didn't really like anyway).\n8) DVD player. Because of country coding, DVD's released in the US are the same ones released in Canada, so many DVD's sold in America have a french language track or french subtitles available. Once familiar with the movie, I don't let my kids listen in english at all. If they want to watch the movie, they know they have to listen to the french.\nAlthough I dislike Disney, we do enjoy the recently released animated version of Tarzan. Phil Colins does the singing on all 3 sound tracks - english, spanish and french. Nice way to compare the sounds of all 3 languages, and the vocabulary is not too difficult for 2nd yr. french students. Some violence, be prepared for a good vs evil theme.\nThe Princess Bride DVD does not have a french language track, but does have french subtitles. We turn off the volume, and just read in the french. Since my kids can quote this movie forward and backward in english, they have no trouble at all following the french.\nThe Wizzard of OZ DVD has a french language track, but the songs are the originals in english. Vocabulary is more difficult than Tarzan.\n9) Books in french. Our local library has a very limited selection, and many are difficult to understand unless your vocabulary is high. Recently at a library book sale, we obtained a box of french books at varying levels... from easy readers (some english and french) to The Old Man and the Sea by Hemmingway. One of the best books that has helped me is \"Easy French Reader\" by R.de Roussy de Sales. Title does not do it justice, as it contains conversations, history lessons, and 'edited' short stories that progress in difficulty. Quite challenging toward the end.\nThe Bible in French: http://un2sg4.unige.ch/athena/html/francaut.html\nWeb site similar to Gutenberg, only texts in French: http://un2sg4.unige.ch/athena/html/francaut.html\nAnother french text site: http://abu.cnam.fr/\n10) CD's and CD-ROM programs. Personally, I like audio productions that I can pop into the CD player when the kids and I are out running errands in the car, or on trips. Berlitz has some, and are dry, particularly for younger ones. (Berlitz's focus is giving you phrases you might need if traveling in a foreign country). Berlitz might be usable for self-starters, self-motivators.\nI've not found any CD-ROM french programs that really helped a lot. I'm not sure why, as I like computers, but I just don't get much from these types of programs. Maybe it is my learning style, so decide for yourself.\nA new bilingual French/English CD is out called \"The Twisted Doors\" that sounds promising, although it is a spooky story of some sort. I've not bought this or read it, or listened to the CD, so you'll have to make your own judgement. Review of the book: http://french.about.com/library/bl-portestordues.htm?terms=Twisted+Doors\n11) I keep a french notebook. In it, I keep my list of common french words, my word of the day and sentences of the day, and any notes I make of french grammar or french helps. This notebook has turned out to be a great resource for me, and I having my kids start their own french notebooks when they are ready.\n12) I would love to be able to take my kids to a french-speaking church, but there are none in our area. This might be a valuable resource for some of you to consider.\nHope this helps, and would be interested to hear what others are doing for 2nd, 3rd, etc. year language study.\nCarmen\nWould there be any reason not to just begin with Latin as your language:regardless of the child's age?:\nHave you read the new Parents Review article on teaching languages ( Beginning Modern Languages ) that was posted to the Ambleside site? The writer gives a list of advice and theories about teaching languages (some of them humorous) and then ends up (with tongue in cheek, I think) with the piece of advice not to bother teaching languages at all because it's impossible to really learn them in England.\nCharlotte Mason's students started with French, which was quite logical for them as many of them had opportunities to spend time in France. In keeping with that pattern, we recommend starting with a modern language (Spanish, French or another language that makes sense for you). Most of the language teaching you'd do with a young child would be oral, so Latin would probably not be the first choice there. You could of course teach the chants and so on, but they're not very meaningful until you get into teaching grammar, and I don't think you want to be doing declensions with a young child.\nIdeally (in CM terms) an older child (say 10 or 11 and up) would have some experience with a modern language and be ready to take on Latin grammar. If they haven't had that background, then of course it's your choice whether you want to focus on one or the other.\nAnne W.\n\"I would like:to start with French as our Foreign Language. What program should I start with? Also when is a good time to start:Latin?\"\nI think you have to choose something that meets your needs as a teacher. I haven't tried the popular programs like Powerglide simply because I don't have access to them and can't afford them right now; but I've heard great things from people who have used Powerglide and Rosetta Stone. Some people highly recommend The Learnables and others say it's boring. I think you could use all of these (as teacher) without knowing the language well yourself. Another less expensive option, suitable for elementary grades, would be the \"Teach Me French\" and \"Teach Me More French\" tapes; they come with the words and coloring/activity books. Finally, a popular program in Canada is \"L'Art de Lire\", and their website is http://www.nallenart.com , I'm pretty sure. If that link doesn't work, just search for \"Nallenart\" .\nIf you have some fluency in the language, then it's easier to use a textbook or put together your own lessons using French children's books and tapes, TV programs, online resources, etc. Our library has quite a good selection and we receive a couple of TV channels with French childrens' shows (and French versions of shows like Arthur that my kids are already familiar with).\nThe main thing seems to be not which program you use, but the amount of consistent exposure your child gets to the language. Of course that's the most difficult thing unless you live somewhere where the second language is spoken, or you speak it fluently yourself! But even some training in another language will help, even if perfect fluency isn't the goal.\nAnne W.\nCM didn't recommend Latin as first language-largely because Latin is learned grammatically, while other languages can be learned by ear. CM recommended Latin beginning a little later-say age 10 to 12-while a second or even third language could be learned in spoken form by very young children.\nThe emphasis on Latin comes from the \"classical\" side of Jenny Sockey's new book, not the CM side, although I could show you where CM says that parents have no right to neglect Latin studies with their children.:-)\nIt's a judgment call for each family. We've chosen not to bother with Latin in the elementary years because we live in a foreign country, and the children need to focus on their \"real\" second language. At the same time, I decided that the \"vocabulary\" aspect of Latin was the most valid reason for learning it, and we have used English From the Roots Up to (slowly) learn those roots (Greek and Latin!).\nOne of CM's big reasons for waiting to start Latin was that children could learn as much in one year (at 12) as they would spend years learning from 6-11. She knew that the schools covered the same ground year after year, and she felt that their time could be better spent learning to actually speak a living language while their tongues and throats were still capable of learning those accents, etc...\n~Karen\n\"A free online Spanish program. It is very nice and easy to use and even gives you the pronunciations of vowels, consonants, words, etc.\" http://www.studyspanish.com\nAnother Spanish website: www.moshihola.org\nThese notes about various foreign language programs on the market were compiled from various member opinions on the Ambleside Online email list. The Advisory has not used all of these programs and therefore cannot give opinions about the compatibility with CM for all of them. These notes are posted to give as much information as possible to those contemplating a foreign language purchase for their children.\nPlease note - list members generally agree that no program can take the place of frequent exposure to that language in a normal setting, such as actually living in a foreign country where that language is spoken, or having a parent who speaks that language. It is also of note that in Jane Healy's book Endangered Minds, children who weren't receiving language stimulation in their native tongue - who were spending more time in front of TVs and video games than in regular, normal conversation with their parents, did not pick up a foreign language when their parents hired a foreign-language-speaking maid. For children to benefit from a bilingual environment, they must be fluent in their own language, and that only comes from the kind of active dialog that comes from interacting with parents.\nLearnables http://www.learnables.com/ Uses native speakers, starts with listening before speaking, much pointing and looking. Appropriate for ages 6-10. Many members said their children found this one \"boring\" and expensive.\nPower Glide http://www.power-glide.com/ Has children's level (\"junior\") and adult level programs, but nothing in between. Total immersion method in programs for older students; junior level adventure stories, while fun, use stories mixing English and the foreign language, making progress slow. Some parents felt that, although the junior program for young children was fun, children retained little and the teacher's guide wasn't very helpful for parents. Students seem to enjoy the program at both levels. Uses lots of repitition, which helps retention. All conversational, no reading required. Power Glide for older students seems popular among Ambleside members. Power Glide is a pricey program\nPhrase A Day for Young Children by Judith White, ages 5-11, limited availablity, may be going out of print? Try http://www.audioforum.com order #SFR275 Amazon.com also sells it as a \"special order hard to find\" item. Cassette and book (no CD). Simple to use as a first step in learning a new language.\nSpringboard to... series (Springboard to Spanish, Springboard to French, etc) Book with two cassettes. Lessons are in English and the foreign language. Lessons are short, and previous concepts are reviewed in subsequent lessons. Children are taught simple vocabulary and phrases through \"Simon says\"-type games. This is a fun introductory program. Available from http://www.audioforum.com/ and other places.\nLyric Language cassettes and vidoes use songs to teach words and phrases in a foreign language. Children learn songs rather than conversational language, so this would need to be supplemented with something like Power Glide. Since songs are sung in both English and the foreign language, some children may learn only the English lyrics. Video version has animated characters doing very modern dances (rap-style in some?) to the songs. Available at http://www.pentonoverseas.com\nRosetta Stone http://www.rosettastone.com/ Computer program with workbook and grammar, so you can read as well as hear the lessons. Available in many langages, seems popular and effective among Ambleside members, but is pricey.\n\"L'Art de Lire\", or Nallenart French by Canadian homeschooler, Norma Allen http://www.nallenart.com or http://www.nallenart.on.ca/us After completing the course, students should know enough to move into high school French. Highly recommended by Canadian list members. Student must be able to read to use the program (although they have an all oral program, 'L'art de Dire', for pre-readers). One member priced the complete program - six levels of workbooks, cassettes, flashcards, teacher keys, and tests for about $120.\nMuzzy http://www.early-advantage.com/ Videotaped lessons in story form with supplementary cassettes for practice and a CDRom program. May seem simple, slow and repetitive - some children find it \"dull.\" Expensive, but comes with a 30-day guarantee.\nInstant Immmersion Language Starter for Kids http://www.eurotalk.co.uk One member found these affordably at Sam's and liked them, but they are expensive from the website.\nStorybridges to... series features a mother telling familiar folktales to her children, mostly in English, with some phrases in the foreign language.

Therefore, students lack an active role in the classroom and as a result they fail to express themselves adequately in spoken language.\nAlso, translating word for word is wrong because exact translation is not always possible or correct. Moreover, translation is nowadays considered an index of one\u2019s language proficiency.\nAnother disadvantage of this method is that it does not provide such practice to the learner that the person can internalize the patterns of a language to the extent to make it a habit.\nGrammar Translation Method Video: positive and negative sides\n* Language learning means acquiring certain skills, which can be learned through practice of listening, speaking, reading and writing and not by just memorizing rules.\nThe audio-lingual method\nIn the audio-lingual method, students are taught directly in the target language without using their native language. New words and grammar are explained orally in the target language.\nUnlike the direct method, the audio-lingual method doesn\u2019t focus much on vocabulary, but on static grammar drills. There is no explicit grammar instruction, just memorizing in form and practising a certain construction until it is used spontaneously.\nThe innovation, however, was the use of the language laboratory or lab (an audio or audio-visual installation aid). In this context, the teacher presents the correct model of a sentence and the students repeat it. The language lab stayed in use in modern teaching, especially to practice listening comprehensions. However, the students exposed to this method have almost no control on their own output and exactly this is in direct opposition with modern language teaching.\nThe origins of the audio-lingual method\nThe audio-lingual method is also known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u2019the army method\u2019\u2019 because of the influence of the military; this method is the product of three historical circumstances and the third factor of its birth was the outbreak of World War II. American slodiers were sent to war all over the world and there was a need to provide them with basic verbal communication skills.\nIn addition, the launching of the first Russian satellite in 1957 motivated the Americans to give special attention to foreign language teaching in order to prevent possible isolation from scientific advances in the world.\nThe other two circumstances inlude: (1) the work of American linguists such as Leonard Bloomfield, who led the development of structural linguistics in the US (1930-1940) and (2) the work of behaviourist psychologists (e.g. B.F. Skinner) who believed that all behaviour (language included) was learnt through repetition and positive or negative reinforcement.\n* The prevailing scientific methods of the time were observation and repetition, conveniently suited for teaching masses.\nThe primary concern of American linguistics in the first decades of the 20th century were languages spoken in the U.S. and linguists relied on observation in order to theoretically describe native languages.\nThe Pennsylvania project conducted in the period from 1965 to 1969 by Philip Smith provided significant proof that the traditional cognitive approach involving mother tongue was more effective than the audio-lingual methods.\nOther research also produced results which showed that explicit grammatical instruction in the mother language is more productive.\nSince 1970, audio-lingualism has been discredited as an effective teaching method, yet, it continues to be used today, although not as the foundation of a course. It is rather integrated into lessons covered by modern language teaching methods.\nThe structural view of language was eventually replaced by the view presented in oral approach. The philosophy of the oral approach consists in viewing speech as the basis of language and structure i.e. the basis of speaking ability.\nAmerican structuralists such as Charles C. Fries shared this view, but the British linguists (such as M.A.K. Halliday and J.R. Firth) went further and stated that structures must be presented in situations in which they could be used. Thereby, they opened the door to Situational Language Teaching.\nAn example of a FUNCTIONAL METHOD\nSituational Language Teaching\nIn applied linguistics, Situational Language Teaching is considered an oral approach developed by British linguists in the period from 1930s to 1960s. Its main principles are learning vocabulary and practising reading skills.\nThis approach (some linguists refer to it as a method) has behavioristic background; it deals less with conditions of learning and more with the processes of learning.\nThese learning processes are divided into three stages :\nreceiving knowledge,\nmemorizing it by repetition and\nusing it in practice to the extent that it becomes a personal skill and habit.\nCharacteristics of Situational Language Teaching:\nIn theory, language learning is a habit-formation, which means mistakes should be avoided as they make bad habits.\nLanguage skills are presented orally and then in written form as they are learnt more effectively that way.\nThe meanings of words are learnt only in a linguistic and cultural context.\nThere is strong emphasis on oral practice, thereby this form of teaching still attracts the interest of many practically oriented classroom teachers.\nThe view of this method was called into question by Noam Chomsky, who in 1957 showed that the structural and behavioristic approaches to language teaching were not right. He claimed that fundamental defining features of a language such as creativity and uniqueness of individual sentences were neglected by their application. He also believed that a learner must have an innate predisposition for a certain kind of\u00c2\u00a0 linguistic competence.\n"}, {"score": 1533.333, "uuid": "fcb1a92d-0f4f-558a-a911-82336635ce01", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0403wb-68-28654", "target_hostname": "www.campusexplorer.com", "target_uri": "http://www.campusexplorer.com/colleges/major/1B53F3D8/Foreign-Languages/", "page_rank": 1.1990534e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Foreign</em> <em>Languages</em> Schools - Find <em>Foreign</em> <em>Languages</em> Degrees, Programs, Colleges", "snippet": "In this major, it helps to have <em>a</em> knack for <em>learning</em> new <em>languages</em>.

Before you choose a school, find out what kinds of opportunities you\u2019ll have to immerse yourself in the language and culture from school-sponsored cultural activities to study abroad programs. Having native speakers on staff can help you learn the language, too. If you\u2019re interested in using your language skills in business or education, make sure the appropriate courses are offered.\nFind Foreign Languages Schools\nForeign Languages Degree Programs\nMany students choose to earn a college or university bachelors degree in Foreign Languages.

Fairview Rd.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau released a report in April that showed 55,444,485 of 280,950,438 people in the U.S. ages 5 and up, roughly 20 percent, spoke a language other than English at home.\n\"Anytime you can say you are the first to do something it's pretty cool,\" he said.\nWorsowicz attended Yujin Gakuen Elementary, a Japanese immersion school in his hometown of Eugene, Ore., until fifth grade.\nWhen he was a child, he said, his father explained that they sent him to the school because they knew people who spoke French and Spanish, but no one who spoke Japanese.\nThey also \"thought it would be funny to have a white kid know Japanese,\" Worsowicz said.\nHis father later told him, \"it was an additional challenge to keep you focused in school and not screw around as much.\"\nThere are a growing number of language immersion schools in the United States, including one that was founded in Columbia called La Petite Ecole, which teaches children French as a second language at an age when children's brains are most compliant.\nStatistics, however, show that language instruction in regular schools is actually decreasing, and relatively few Americans know a second language. Scholars have spent years studying why Americans seem to disregard the importance of learning languages. While they have developed theories and posited potential solutions, the future of language learning in the United States remains hazy.\nLinguistics in America\nSince 1997, the percentage of elementary and middle schools that offer foreign language courses has fallen significantly, from 31 percent to 25 percent at the elementary level and from 75 percent to 58 percent at the middle school level.\nHowever, the decline in elementary schools appeared primarily in public schools, while private elementary schools teaching foreign language remained roughly the same at 51 percent.\nThe percentage of high schools teaching foreign language has remained at about 91 percent.\nThis information comes from a nationwide survey of public and private schools conducted in 2008 by the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, D.C.\nMeanwhile, the number of language immersion schools designed to teach a second language to English-speaking children and young adults has actually increased.\nSince 1962, 367 two-way immersion programs \u2014 schools that pair native English speakers with those who speak another native language \u2014 have developed in 28 states, including Washington, D.C. And, as of 2007, 263 total and partial immersion schools have been established, according to the Center for Applied Linguistics website.\n\"The younger the learner, the more likely the acquisition of a second language will be facilitated\u2026\u201d Adel Safty wrote in the Canadian Journal of Education. Linguistic ability shows the greatest development between the ages of 4 and 8, she wrote.\nWhile the number of people who speak a language other than English at home is still relatively small, it has more than doubled over the past 30 years, according to a U.S. Census Bureau survey released in April.\nThe largest percentage of people who speak a foreign language are between 18 and 40. The 5 to 17 age group trails closely, according to the report.\n\"Certainly at the universities there is a desire for English speakers to learn different languages,\" said Maria Beebe, a self-employed consultant who helps universities develop international programs by either attracting foreign students or providing an international experience to American students.\nBut, among those 41 and older, the percentage of people who speak a second language decreases.\n\"For some people who have not learned languages in their youth, when they become adults it is more difficult,\" she said.\nBeebe, who is from the Philippines, specializes in the study of language and spent a decade at Washington State University doing international development work, including managing the program Afghan Equality Alliances , which involved working with higher education institutions in Afghanistan.\n\"There are Americans who want to learn other languages because it provides more opportunity and sensitivity,\" Beebe said.\nClassroom immersion\nNine 3- and 4-year-old children sit in a circle on a blue rug with multicolored numbers lining the edges. The French song coming from the classroom probably is incoherent to most people, but not to these children.\nThey are just a few of the 47 students enrolled at La Petite Ecole , a French immersion school off Fairview Road in western Columbia that was founded by Joelle Quoirin in 2005. The school was established to teach children between the ages of 2 and 6 a second language while their minds are most malleable.\nUp until the late 1990s, it was believed that the window of opportunity for learning a second language was open until adolescence, Quoirin said. But later studies of the brain, through the use of MRIs, revealed that the window actually shuts closer to the ages of 6, 7 and 8.\nA second language learned before that age is stored in the same part of the brain as a person's first language. After the window closes, however, the brain stores a second language separately, making grammatical mistakes more likely and a native-like accent more difficult.\nDuring the school day at La Petite Ecole, teachers strive to speak only French to the students, Quoirin said.\n\"It is very rare when teachers speak English to the children,\" she said.\nShe said that while the children are learning a second language, they also are learning academic and life skills.\n\"Some people think, 'Why go there only to learn French?'\" she said. But, they learn skills they would acquire in a regular school \"with the added bonus of learning a language.\"\nShe said the benefits of learning a second language are too many to enumerate.\n\"The primary (benefit) is to open the brain and have the children more ready to learn,\" she said. \"It helps them to learn languages as a whole.\"\nQuoirin said that from the first time a child steps into the classroom until the time he or she leaves, there is a noticeable difference. Pointing to a little girl in the corner, Quoirin recalled how the child spent her first month at La Petite Ecole crying on a pillow. Now, she is doing math and making progress in all areas of learning.\n\"I am amazed at what kids can do,\" she said.\nThe American mindset\nAlthough immersion schools have popped up throughout the country over the past 50 years, only 19.7 percent of those surveyed speak a language other than English in their households, according to the Census Bureau report.\nIn comparison, in the European Union, which is composed of 27 different countries and 23 official languages, 56 percent of Europeans speak a language other than their mother tongue, and 28 percent speak two foreign languages, according to a 2006 European Commission survey . The commission is preparing to do a more up-to-date survey where it will test students' listening, reading and writing skills in languages other than their first language.\nOnly 8 percent of Europeans surveyed consider language learning unimportant, according to the report.\nMany journals and books have been written by various scholars and people who have devoted their lives to the study of linguistics and the lack of language diversity in America.\nThis American language mindset can be traced back to the establishment of the original 13 colonies, said Joshua Fishman, a retired sociolinguistics professor at Stanford University.\nWhile there were people who spoke languages other than English in Colonial times, the languages were discounted because they were deemed unnecessary, Fishman said. Early Colonial life was very dependent on materialistic success.\n\u201cIt made us rigid, and we never lost it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe almighty power is still almighty.\u201d\nFishman, 85, has been immersed in language his entire life. He grew up in a Hebrew and Yiddish-speaking household with parents who were language activists, and he later learned Spanish. He has written a number of books and has devoted much of his time to studying minority languages around the world.\nHe said he believes the mindset that Americans hold toward other cultures comes from their intense focus on reaping more rewards than other countries.\nHe said Americans concentrate far too much on \"instrumental values,\" such as making more money and having a better ability to wage and be engaged in warfare. That, he said, causes them to disregard what other cultures have to offer.\nThis emphasis is at the root of the American tendency to look negatively on aspects of other cultures, including language, he said.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t value cultural heritages and values, then you are not going to have much of a positive attitude toward languages,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cIt is a great pity for people who do not love culture like opera and literature. It is a great pity for yourself.\u201d\nRecalling his childhood, Fishman said his father often would ask at the dinner table: \"What have you done for the language today?\"\nFishman recalled his typical response: \"I tried to speak Yiddish to Louie on the street, but he doesn\u2019t know it.\"\n\"That is OK, but you have to remind him of it,\" his father would say.\nCompared to countries in Europe, which have a special language dynamic because they are surrounded by various cultures, America is physically separated from them, only adding to isolationist views.\n\u201c(Americans) don\u2019t think in cultural terms,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cI think (Europe) does think in cultural terms, and it does value language for its literature and history, for things that are just junk for most of Americans.\u201d\nMost Europeans can speak three or more languages because it is something they value and emphasize, he said.\n\u201cThe only language that exists really in the world is English as far as we are concerned,\" he said. \"This is not a language-conscious society.\u201d\nWhen Americans go abroad as tourists, they often avoid other languages by staying in hotels with other Americans or spending their trip on tour buses, he said.\n\u201cThat is where the concept of the 'ugly American' comes from, because they are ugly out there,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cGoing out and buying souvenirs and socializing with each other and not focusing on the culture.\u201d\nThe irony, though, is that America is more dependent on other countries than it has ever been before, he said. Fishman believes there would have to be a long-term threat for Americans to change their mindset toward learning languages.\nAmericans tend to emphasize language only when immediate threats force them into contact with other cultures, Fishman said. The last time that happened was during World War II.\n\"It is a vicious downward cycle,\" he said.\nWhen Americans begin to learn and appreciate different languages, they may begin to feel less alienated, Fishman said.\n\"You only get to loving languages by having languages around you,\" he said.\nIt appears that may be happening as we speak.\nA possible explanation\nBeebe said she has noticed an increase in different spoken languages.\n\"In the past 10 or 15 years, I hear more languages spoken, especially around airports and metropolitan cities and ethnic restaurants and groceries,\" she said.\nThis also could be due to the increase in the number of people who have immigrated into the country. During the past decade, more than 6.8 million immigrants have become naturalized citizens, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .\nWith them, they bring their possessions, expectations, culture \u2014 and language. While it is important for them to learn English, their own language can often be just as important in establishing unity in a new home.\n\"For some of the older, more established immigrants,\" she said, \"they may want to maintain their identity by finding people who speak their language.\"\nIn some ways, America is catering to these new cultures, particularly Spanish.\n\"Just in terms of announcements at airports, there is more Spanish, and even on employment sites,\" Beebe said. \"You have a choice of English or Spanish, even some Vietnamese.\"\n\"I think it is good for various groups to maintain their languages. It helps their identities,\" Beebe said. \"It is good for (English speakers) to learn some of these other languages. It should be a two-way process.\"\nUtilizing learned skills\nAs Worsowicz packs for his imminent semester in Japan, he looks back on his time in the immersion school.\n\"I liked being able to do something at 7 years old that even my 40-year-old parents couldn't do,\" he said.\nAs he progressed in school, he began taking classes in English as well as Japanese, such as grammar and reading.\n\"We did basically the same thing in each class, just one class you did it in Japanese and one class you'd do it in English,\" Worsowicz said.\nAt the end of fifth grade, his class took a two-week trip to Japan as a way to \"test out your Japanese,\" Worsowicz said. Each student stayed in a Japanese family's home and went to school with that family's children.\n\"That was the first time I had gone anywhere for two weeks,\" he said. \"It was cool to be in someone else's family.\"\nWorsowicz transferred before middle school but met with a tutor once a week to converse in Japanese.\n\"It was a good way to not forget the Japanese we had learned,\" he said.\nWorsowicz studied Japanese for two years in high school then for another two years at the University of Oregon.\nDuring his first year at MU, he focused on journalism, taking a break from Japanese. However, his passion for the language surfaced once more after he spent the summer before his sophomore year taking classes in Japan. The next year, he decided to enroll in Japanese again.\nWhen he was approached by the study abroad office about traveling to Japan for the semester, Worsowicz jumped at the chance.\n\"I know I'll have a good time there,\" he said. \"That is one thing I can honestly say.\"\nWhile he does not know exactly what he wants to do or where he will be after he graduates, he wants to put his Japanese to work.\n\"I want a job where I can keep sports as a part of my life, but I also want to keep Japanese in my life,\" he said. \"I want to mix the two, but honestly I don't know what that would be.\"\nAs he looks back on his experiences with Japanese language and culture, though, he realizes he has an unusual talent. Worsowicz said that while English is becoming a more universal language, it is important that Americans try to broaden their language skills.\nThat way, he said, they can \"communicate as much as possible with as many people as possible.\"\nShow Me the Errors ( What's this? )\nReport corrections or additions here.

At Dino Lingo , we reviewed both of the methods and summarized the pros and cons of each method, as listed in the following table.\nFREE ENGL\u0130SH FLASH CARDS FROM DINO LINGO\nTarget Language Only Instruction\nWhat matters is the duration of exposure to the target language. Immersion provides maximum amount of exposure in different contexts. (Genesee, 1987; Wode, 2001)\nMany studies have indicated immersion is the best method for children to acquire a foreign language.\n(Wode, 2001, ELIAS Studies)\nYoung children can learn by just hearing without any effort (Kuhl, 2004), they don`t need to be instructed in their primary language.\nInstruction in Learner\u2019s language\nWhat matters is motivation and understanding. If children don`t understand the instructions and if they have positive attitudes toward their first language, their motivation will decrease causing loss of interest in the target language.

However, for babies and small children it is recommended that immersion is the best method since small children do not have any concept of \u201cprimary language\u201d in their brain. Additionally, the studies that were conducted by using mixed methods had adult subjects while the immersion studies involved very young subjects including infants, toddlers and kindergarteners.\nKinzler, K.D., Dupoux, E., & Spelke, E.S.

Qualifications: BA TEFL. TEFL Experience: Russia and the USA.\nWelcome to i-to-i\u2019s Online TEFL! My name\u2019s Alex, and I graduated with honors from Perm State Pedagogical (TEFL) University in Perm, Russia back in 1995.\nI have worked as an interpreter in the past but chose teaching for my career because I found it to be in greater demand and more creative than translation. In Russia, teaching is a very female-dominated (99% of language teachers here are women) and consequently I was viewed as quite an oddity at first, but then began to steadily build my reputation.\nIn 1996 and 1997 I helped to organize several seminars for local teachers. It was then that I became fascinated by the 'Communicative' approach to TEFL, which contrasted so sharply with the traditional Soviet grammar translation style.\nSince then, I have been teaching English at two Lyceums (high schools affiliated with universities). The curriculum is highly intensive: 10 hours of English a week for each group, and the students are extremely creative. A lack of classroom materials also pushes my own creativity to the limit.\nOver the last few years, I have also tried my hand at a number of other roles: preparation courses for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language); teaching classes of young children; and also teaching private students whose goals are as wide as their levels of proficiency. Many of my former students now study in major Universities of Russia, the USA, Norway and the Netherlands.\nI had a pause in my TEFL career back in 1998-99 when I was enrolled in the Creative Writing Program at the American University in Washington, DC. It was in the US that I also tried my hand at Teaching Russian as a Foreign Language and discovered that teaching your own language is a greater challenge than teaching a language you\u2019ve had to learn yourself.\nI am married with two children - a daughter and a son.\nJudy Mabe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 TEFL Tutor. Qualifications: RSA CELTA, Trinity TESOL Diploma. TEFL Experience: Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK.\nI've been in TEFL since 1987 and have taught about 45 different nationalities.\nSome of the people and places I've been to are unforgettable: the Czech Republic in 1990, when young people were so excited about their new opportunities; the hospitality of a family living in a remote Guatemalan village, whose prize possession was their Singer Sewing Machine; staying with a Russian heart and lung surgeon who smoked 100 cigarettes a day; my very first class of students, who always did their homework; the four-year-old children who loved learning new songs; and the female office workers in Verona who always looked as if they'd just come off the catwalk. I've met some great teachers too! And I remember the woman who came on a weekend i-to-i course because she'd been travelling for 4 years and had spent nearly all her savings.\nOverall though, I think the most positive thing about being in TEFL for me is having some understanding of the values and beliefs of other cultures.\nKatia Berntzen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 TEFL Tutor. Qualifications: RSA CELTA & DELTA. TEFL Experience: Norway.\nI have been working as a TEFL teacher for more than 12 years. Twelve very grateful years indeed, since I have always enjoyed teaching a great deal. I finished university in 1989 and moved to Britain in order to study and pass my Proficiency Examination, which I did! After that, I have been through a number of postgraduate and specialization courses including the CELTA (Certificate of English Language Teaching to Adults) and DELTA (Diploma of English Language Teaching to Adults).\nOver the years I have taught students of different nationalities and believe this multicultural teaching experience has positively enhanced my performance as a TEFL professional.

As parents, we spend many months encouraging our little ones to utter their first words and begin their voyage through language. During the school years, teachers pound proper grammar into kids\u2019 heads. It usually is not until children reach the middle years of their schooling that they are potentially offered the opportunity to learn a second language. But, is it too late? What is the optimal age for learning a foreign language?\nThe Brain and Learning a Foreign Language\nThe brain learns in amazing ways. Our brains have many compartments that are in charge of different specialties, such as the left brain covering creativity and the frontal lobe taking care of solving problems. According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, learning occurs without intervention \u2013 and introducing a second language to youngsters can be effortless. They find that in the early stages of learning, \u201c neural circuits are activated piecemeal, incompletely, and weakly .\u201d With more experience, those circuits become hardwired and the learning becomes automatic.\nFor some children, learning a second language happens within the home, through parents, beginning at birth. Children raised in a bilingual environment often have a dominant language, or one that they excel in, that is most often spoken in their everyday life. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, it is never too early to introduce a child to a secondary language, and learning two languages will not cause any speech or language delay problems for children .\nIntroducing a Second Language\nFor those parents that are not versed in two languages, the educational system or personal tutors are looked upon to introduce another language. Even short bouts of intensive foreign language learning at the elementary level sets children up for a positive foreign language learning experience. There are several benefits for introducing young children to a foreign language, such as:\nThe earlier children begin learning a foreign language, the greater the foreign language skill set they obtain. Children that begin learning at an earlier age, and then continue the foreign language study in years to come, have a better chance of developing the secondary language at a higher level of proficiency .\nLearning a foreign language aides in keeping the brain healthy and boosting brainpower. Learning other languages alters grey matter in the brain, which processes information, just like how exercising creates healthy muscles. Those who learn languages earlier in life are more likely to have more advanced grey matter \u2013 meaning they will be better learners in general.\nAccording to Kathleen Marcos, writing for Kid Source, children that are exposed to learning a foreign language prior to the onset of adolescence are more likely to have a native-like pronunciation . Along with learning a secondary language, young children also gain important knowledge of other cultures, further broadening their outlook and appreciation of others.\nWhen to Start\nBut, what is the ideal age for learning a foreign language? It is hard to determine an exact number. Around the age of three, children are ripe for hearing and pronouncing, and are just beginning to grasp their native language. This makes it an ideal time to begin introducing a foreign language. Along with learning about their native language, hearing a foreign language and being encouraged to speak it, aides in the learning of both languages. But, do not expect too much. Take it slow and keep expectations low for a positive language-learning environment.\nStart by introducing children to music or television in a foreign language within a comfortable environment. Even though you may not think your child is gleaning any information, he is getting his ears used to hearing the language, which sets him up for future foreign language learning.\nIntroduce one word at a time. Most young children are not speaking in complete sentences yet, so it cannot be expected for them to learn a foreign language in the same way. While introducing the word to the child in their native language, say the word in the foreign language also , so the learning happens at the same time.\nTurn the learning into a game. Find fun ways to use the words for colors or shapes in a foreign language in your family\u2019s favorite game. The next time your child wants to play Bingo, say the letters or numbers in the foreign language and see if he can figure it out. Making learning fun encourages his future enjoyment of learning more of the secondary language.\nEncourage your child to teach the foreign language he is learning to the rest of the family. This gives your child the role of a foreign language teacher, encouraging his brain to reinforce learning, and the opportunity to practice the skills he has gained. It also boosts his confidence and speaking abilities.\nOlder Foreign Language Learners\nIf a foreign language is not introduced until a child is in his teenage years, he is still able to maximize his learning \u2013 with some additional help. Once your child has been introduced to foreign language within the school setting, help reinforce learning at home. Often, one short class a week in foreign language isn\u2019t enough to create concrete learning . Spending time with your child reinforcing his learning shares your desire to see his success in learning a secondary language, and offers an opportunity for some quality together time.\nIt is never too late to learn a foreign language. The adult brain is always ready for new information, and by using repetitive methods and immersion , the older brain is able to absorb new language learning just as well as a young child\u2019s.\nBy Sarah Lipoff.

When it comes to learning a second language, however, this readiness to imitate concerns some parents\u2014even some who have quite good conversational skills in a second language. They worry that if their language skills are a little rusty, or their accent a little too noticeably American, their children will pick up some bad habits and start off on the wrong foot.

As for the second, well, \u201capple\u201d is self-explanatory . . . maybe \u201cstrudel\u201d means \u201cgooey?\u201d John F.

Or you want your child to, knowing that a command of Spanish, Russian, or Mandarin is well worth the effort. Now the question is, where to start? With so many language courses available, which option is best for your kid? The answer depends on individual goals and learning styles. Despite the absence of a one-size-fits-all solution, familiarizing yourself with the various possibilities will enable you to make a good choice for your child. What follows is a survey of some of the most prominent approaches now in use. These range from immersion language courses in a classroom setting to specialized media for learning at home.\nRead more about language courses for children\nPortuguese for Kids\nDespite its international prevalence, Portuguese is a rare bird in American elementary and secondary schools. Por que? With 178 million speakers worldwide, Portuguese ranks as the third most widely spoken European language, after Spanish and English. Many Americans know the language only as a relative\u2014not to say ugly stepsister\u2014of Spanish. Spaniards themselves, however, have long regarded this kindred Romance language with admiration; Cervantes himself dubbed Portuguese \u201cthe sweet language.\u201d Sweet, widespread, and easy to learn, Portuguese for kids is an appealing choice.\nRead more about Portuguese for Kids\nRussian For Kids\nIn this era of vigorous technological development, the value of a sound education in science and math generally goes without question. Fair enough, right? It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to recognize the wider applications of her own quantitative training and its demand in the professional world. What too often escapes notice is the equal importance of foreign languages like Russian for kids early in their development.\nRead more about Russian for Kids\nSpanish Language Course\nRemember when political debates revolved around issues other than the economy and unemployment?

The New York Times reported that the country\u2019s economy has grown to become the second-largest in the world. Previously, Japan had occupied the number two slot, and while the United States remains at the top, economists expect it to share the spotlight with China by 2030. Never has there been a more appropriate time to encourage Chinese for kids.

Hypothesizing that motivation to communicate may be different from motivation to read, the present study attempts to investigate foreign language reading motivation. The data for this study was obtained from an original questionnaire, which largely drew upon Wigfield and Guthrie's (1995, 1997) theory of reading motivation in L1. The results of a statistical analysis suggest that motivation to read in English may be divided into four sub-components, namely Intrinsic Value of Reading in English, Attainment Value of Reading in English, Extrinsic Utility Value of Reading in English, and Expectancy for Success in Reading in English.\nkeywords: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, reading success, reading attitude\nIntroduction\nIn the field of second language acquisition (SLA), a great deal of research has been done in order to investigate second language learning motivation ever since Gardner and Lambert first shed light on the role of attitudes and motivation in second language acquisition (Gardner & Lambert, 1959). Gardner and his associates (e.g., Gardner, 1985, 1988, 2000, 2001; Gardner & Smythe, 1975; Gardner & MacIntyre, 1991, 1993) proposed a model referred to as the Socio-Educational Model of Language Learning. Underscoring the importance of the socio-psychological aspects of second language acquisition, Gardner's model includes integrative motivation, defined as a combination of attitudes toward the target group, interest in foreign language, and integrative orientation, as a key component of the socio-educational model.\nAlthough no one seems to argue against the significance of socio-psychological aspects of motivation in language learning, it is this concept of integrative motivation that has often been an object of criticism. Some researchers (e.g., Crookes & Schmidt, 1991; D\u00f6rnyei, 1994) argue that Gardner's definitions of integration-related terms are ambiguous whereas other researchers (Cl\u00e9 ment & Kruidenier, 1985; Crookes & Schmidt, 1991; D\u00f6rnyei, 1990; Oxford & Shearin, 1994) claim that the integrative motivational subsystem is more multifaceted than originally proposed. In addition, another criticism has been raised with reference to the degree to which an emphasis has been placed on integrative motivation in Gardner's socio-educational model. Summarized in Au (1988) as the integrative motive hypothesis, Gardner and his associates (Gardner, 1979, 1985, 1988; Gardner & Lambert, 1959) consistently found that integrative motivation plays a significant role in second language acquisition. However, many studies (Au, 1988; Crookes & Schmidt, 1991; D\u00f6rnyei, 1990; Ely, 1986; Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Gardner, Smythe & Cl\u00e9ment, 1979; Kraemer, 1993; Lukmani, 1972; Muchnick & Wolfe, 1982; Oller, 1981; Oller, Baca & Vigil, 1977) carried out in different contexts, especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts, found contradictory results. In part due to such dissatisfaction with Gardner and his associate's dominant models of motivation, there have been numerous attempts to redefine second/foreign language learning motivation in the past decade, (e.g., Crookes & Schmidt, 1991; D\u00f6rnyei, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2001; D\u00f6rnyei & Otto, 1998; MacIntyre, Cl\u00e9 ment, D\u00f6rnyei & Noels, 1998; Oxford & Shearin, 1994, 1996; Schmidt, Boraie & Kassabgy, 1996).\nHowever, most research, including Gardner's, focuses on students' motivation to interact or communicate with target language speakers. Therefore, many of their findings may not be directly applicable to students in EFL contexts, where limited contact with the target community is the norm. Furthermore, students with limited opportunities to use the target language inevitably have to rely on written texts as a major source of input, as is the case with the present study. Despite this, in the field of SLA, to my knowledge, Day and Bamford (1998) are the only ones who have attempted to create a theoretical model of motivation to read in a second language. In an effort to reflect the multi-faceted nature of second language reading motivation, their model included expectancy and value components. The former is concerned with constructs regarding materials and reading ability whereas the latter contains attitudes toward reading in the second language and socio-cultural environment. They further argue that materials and attitudes are major influences on motivation, which in turn may influence the decision to read in a second language (L2). Their model, however, lacks empirical evidence.\nThe paucity of research on L2 reading motivation is also an interesting contrast with the abundance of work done to probe the correlation between extensive reading and achievement (e.g., Cho & Krashen, 1994; Elley, 1991; Hafiz & Tudor, 1990; Krashen, 1993; Mason & Krashen, 1997; Robb & Susser, 1989). Therefore, on the assumption that students' motivation is an important factor in the success of any reading program, this study attempted to investigate what constitutes foreign language reading motivation.\nIn exploring foreign language reading motivation, Gardner's concept of integrative orientation was incorporated into the present study. Despite the fact that it is not directly linked to L2 reading motivation, it was included to see whether this somewhat controversial concept could be a distinct construct in the domain of reading in an EFL context.\nMotivation to Read in First Language\nThe general theoretical basis of this study rests on the theory of first language (L1) reading motivation proposed by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995) based on the hypothesis that students' motivation may be, to a certain extent, domain-specific. That is, students may be, for example, motivated to speak or listen, but not to read in English. Furthermore, this L1 reading motivational theory was used as a model instead of L2 theory because almost no theories or models can be found in the area of L2 reading aside from Day and Bamford (1998).\nWigfield and Guthrie tried to conceptualize the nature of motivation specifically for reading, arguing that motivation to learn can be domain-specific. However, due to a lack of literature dealing specifically with reading motivation, they sought support for their model by drawing upon a number of general motivational constructs that are relevant to engaging in reading. One of the theories Wigfield and Guthrie referred to was an influential model of motivation in mainstream psychology known as expectancy-value theory (Eccles, Adler, Futterman, Goff, Kaezala, Meece & Midgley, 1983; Eccles, Adler & Meece, 1984; Eccles, Lord & Midgley, 1991; Eccles & Wigfield, 1995; Wigfield, 1994; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992).\nExpectancy-value theory claims that achievement behavior is predicted by two constructs: expectancy for success in a given task and the value the individual associates with success in that task. According to this theory, expectancy for success can be predicted by perceptions of task difficulty, and by task-specific self-concept, that is, an individual's expectation of their ability to do a domain-specific task. Eccles et al. (1983) argue that the former is negatively related with expectancies for success whereas the latter is positively related with expectancies for success. They further contend that the task-specific self-concept of ability and perceptions of task difficulty are dependent upon how students interpret past events, and how they perceive attitudes and expectations of others.\nEccles and Wigfield (1995) hypothesize that the value the individual associates with success in that task consists of four components: Attainment Value, Intrinsic Value, Extrinsic Utility Value, and Cost. Attainment value refers to the individual's perception of importance of success in a given task. The importance of success in a task is consciously determined by the individual with reference to their perception of how significant a task is to their self-schema or identity. Intrinsic value refers to enjoyment that task engagement brings about whereas extrinsic utility value refers to the usefulness of the task. Both intrinsic value and extrinsic utility value in expectancy-value theory are similar to the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in Deci and Ryan's model (1985). The former is defined as motivation to do a task for its own sake while the latter is defined as motivation to engage in a task in order to obtain external rewards such as getting good grades. The last component of value in this theory is cost. Eccles and Wigfield (1995) define cost as the perceived negative consequences of engaging in the task. These include not only the effort required for the task but also perceived emotional states such as anxiety. Cost refers to extended effort, time and emotional expenditures.\nOther motivational theories Wigfield and Guthrie consulted include self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986, 1989, 1993; Schunk, 1984, 1991), achievement goal theory (Battle, 1966; Crandall, 1969; Crandall, Karkovsky & Preston, 1962), and intrinsic motivation theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). Self-efficacy theory is a model that includes self-efficacy as a major construct where self-efficacy is defined as an individual's evaluation of their capacity to organize and execute courses of action. This definition is quite similar to Eccles and Wigfield's definition of task-specific self-concept described above. Unlike self-efficacy theory, achievement goal theory focuses more on the individual's perception of how important achievement of different tasks are to them whereas intrinsic motivation theory emphasizes intrinsic motivation, which is doing a task for its own sake.\nUsing these motivational theories as reference points, Wigfield and Guthrie (1995) divide L1 reading motivation into the following three categories, which entail 11 sub-components:\nCompetence and Reading Efficacy\n(10) social reasons for reading\n(11) reading compliance\nThe first category concerns an individual's sense of efficacy and beliefs about their ability, and consists of Reading Efficacy, Reading Challenge and Reading Work Avoidance. The notion of Reading Challenge refers to the satisfaction of understanding complicated ideas in a text whereas the notion of Work Avoidance refers to aspects of reading the informer dislike.\nThe second category is derived from theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, achievement goal orientation, and achievement values, and is further sub-categorized into two parts. The first is mostly concerned with intrinsic motivation, and the second with extrinsic motivation and performance goal orientation (Ames, 1992; Nicholls, Cheung, Lauer & Patachnick, 1989). The former entails Reading Curiosity, Reading Involvement, and the Importance of Reading. Reading Curiosity refers to the desire to learn about a certain idea, and is related to work on reading interest (Renninger, 1992; Schiegele, 1996) whereas Reading Involvement refers to the enjoyment involved with reading different kinds of texts, and, thus, corresponds to Schallert and Reed's work (1997) and the notion of intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985). On the other hand, the concept of the Importance of Reading or subjective task value is grounded in Wigfield and Eccles' (1992) work.\nThe second sub-category includes Competition in Reading, Reading Recognition, and Reading for Grades. These three aspects are separate from one another in that Reading Competition is concerned with an individual's attempt to outperform others in reading, Reading Recognition is related with tangible forms of recognition such as teacher or peer approval, and Reading for Grades is associated mainly with the teacher's evaluation of learners' reading performance.\nThe last category consists of Social Reasons for Reading and Reading Compliance, based on the assumption that reading can be a social activity in a way that children often read in social settings and, thus, read to achieve social goals. Social Reasons for Reading are concerned with the process in which children share the meanings of the text with significant others, whereas Reading Compliance refers to the kind of reading required by the teacher.\nBased on their 11 theoretical aspects of reading motivation, Wigfield and Guthrie (1995) developed the Motivation for Reading Questionnaire (MRQ). They administered it to 105 fourth- and fifth graders in the United States in an attempt to identify empirically aspects of reading motivation (Wigfield & Guthrie, 1997). The statistical analyses of the MRQ results implied that, although the 11 aspects Wigfield and Guthrie identified did not always cluster as predicted, children's reading motivation is in fact multidimensional. Baker and Wigfield (1999) also administered the MRQ to 371 fifth- and sixth-graders in the United States. The statistical analyses of the data obtained confirmed Wigfield and Guthrie's claim for the multidimensionality of L1 reading motivation.\nConsidering these findings that suggest the multidimensionality of reading motivation, this study attempted to investigate what comprises foreign language reading motivation, albeit with a different sample. This study was designed to fit an EFL context, drawing upon the model proposed by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995, 1997). It was hypothesized that foreign language reading motivation, although different in some respects from L1 reading motivation, would be a multidimensional construct, and, to a certain degree, independent of general motivational constructs. Consequently, the research question for the present study was:\nWhat are the major sub-components of motivation to read in English for a sample of university students in an EFL setting?\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 447 students at a women's university in Japan participated in this study. All of the students were in intact groups and separated into 15 different reading classes with approximately 30 in each class.\nMaterials\nAt the beginning of the semester, a 30-item seven-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered in Japanese as a means of investigating students' foreign language reading motivation. (See Appendix A for the original questionnaire, and Appendix B for its English translation.) The internal consistency estimate of reliability for the questionnaire was calculated, and Cronbach's Alpha was .93.\nMany of the questionnaire items were written referring to the theory of reading motivation proposed by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995, 1997). Although Wigfield and Guthrie identified and included 11 components in their MRQ, three components, Competition in Reading, Reading Recognition, and Social Reasons for Reading, were not included in this study as these three components did not seem relevant to the participants. This irrelevance is due to the fact that Wigfield and Guthrie's motivational scales were specifically developed for primary school students learning to read in their L1. Because some items appearing in the MRQ were not considered directly applicable to university students, based on some results of my earlier studies (Mori, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002) individual items were created so that they would be relevant to the participants and the context in which this study was carried out (see Appendix C for details).\nThe rest of the items were written referring to the concept of integrative orientation in Gardner's socio-educational model of motivation (Gardner 1979, 1980, 1985, 1988, 2000, 2001). Integrative orientation is defined by Gardner as an integrative reason for learning the language, and is measured in the Attitude/Motivation Test Battery (Gardner & Smythe, 1981) by four items including \"Studying French can be important for me because it will enable me to better understand and appreciate French art and literature,\" and \"Studying French can be important for me because I will be able to participate more freely in the activities of other cultural groups.\" Thus, the questionnaire also included items that attempted to tap into some integrative reasons for learning to read in English.\nResults\nIn order to determine the interrelationship among items in the questionnaire, a principal components analysis was performed. The number of factors to be extracted was based on the following criteria:\nMinimum eigenvalues of 1.0\nEach factor contains individual items with a minimum loading of .45 or higher.\nEigenvalues appear before the decrease of eigenvalues level off in a scree plot.\nFactor loadings of .32 and above (the minimum suggested in Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996) were initially examined. However, since in this study loadings of .32 produced several complex items that loaded on more than one factor, a loading of .45 or above was chosen as the criterion for interpretation. Any items which did not load on any factors at >.45 were eliminated (items 7, 9, 20, and 25. See Appendix B), and the correlation matrix was reanalyzed. The internal consistency estimate of reliability for the questionnaire with 26 items was calculated, and Cronbach's Alpha was .93. After varimax rotation, a four-factor solution was chosen, which accounted for 56.50% of the total variance in reading motivation (see Table 1).\nTable 1: Factor Loadings for Principal Factors Extraction and Varimax Rotation of Four Factors\nFactor 1\n0.05\n0.05\nTable 2 clearly shows which items loaded on which factors. Means and standard deviations can also be found in Table 2.\nTable 2: Items Arranged According to Factors with Means and Standard Deviations\nFactor\nSD\nFactor one: Intrinsic Value of Reading\n1.

By learning to read in English, I hope to learn about various opinions in the world.\n5.42\n1.36\nFactor three: Importance of Reading\n3.

My grades for English reading classes at junior and senior high schools were not very good.\n4.11\n1.74\nFactor 1 obtained high loadings from 12 items. Those include items that were expected to split into four components, but, in fact, loaded together on this factor: Reading Curiosity (1, 12, 16, 29), Reading Involvement (2, 15, 29), Reading Avoidance (8, 23, 30, 9), and Reading Challenge (22). This result indicates that there is communality among those four hypothetical reading motivational components. A close examination of the items revealed that the communality may represent degree of students' interest in reading in English or their perception of enjoyment involved in reading in English. If that is the case, the construct underlying these items is similar to intrinsic value in Eccles' expectancy-value theory. Thus, Factor 1 is best defined as Intrinsic Value of Reading.\nFour items of Integrative Orientation for Reading in English, and two items of Reading Curiosity loaded on Factor 2. Close examination of the items, however, reveals that with items grouped under Integrative Orientation such as \"I would like to get a job that uses what I studied in English reading class,\" and \"By learning to read in English, I hope to be able to read English newspapers and/or magazines\" seem to better fit the description of Extrinsic Utility Value or perceived usefulness as explained in expectancy value theory. Therefore, Factor 2 was named Extrinsic Utility Value of Reading.\nFactor 3 obtained high loadings from five items, most of which are concerned with importance of reading in English. Factor 3 was defined as Importance of Reading in English. All Items originally grouped under the heading of Reading Efficacy loaded on Factor 4. Thus, Factor 4 was labelled Reading Efficacy.\nDiscussion\nThis study drew upon the motivational theories derived from empirical research done by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995, 1997), and Gardner (1985). However, most of the questionnaire items included in the present study differ from those used by Wigfield and Guthrie due to the differences in setting and the participants of the studies. To be specific, the participants in this study were university students learning to read in a foreign language while the theory proposed by Wigfield and Guthrie is based on their data obtained from grade school students learning to read in L1; the theory proposed by Gardner is based on his data gathered in ESL settings. Nevertheless, the structural components of English reading motivation found in this study can be compared with those identified by those researchers.\nThe majority of the items were expected to cluster into factors that corresponded to eight of the 11 aspects of L1 reading motivation identified by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995). Those aspects include Reading Efficacy, Reading Challenge, Reading Curiosity, Reading Involvement, Importance of Reading, Reading for Grades, Compliance, and Reading Work Avoidance. However, among those eight aspects, only Reading Efficacy and Importance of Reading were clearly identified. Reading Curiosity, Reading Involvement, Reading Avoidance, and Reading Challenge clustered into one factor, defined as Intrinsic Value of Reading. It is not surprising, however, that Reading Curiosity and Reading Involvement loaded on this factor because they were claimed to be closely related to Intrinsic Value. It is also understandable that Reading Avoidance, which is defined as aspects of reading that students do not like, was found to be closely associated with Intrinsic Value, considering the fact that reversed scores for the items (e.g., \"Long and difficult English passages put me off\") were obtained for the calculation.\nThere is also a possibility that the items supposedly concerned with Reading Challenge (e.g., \"I enjoy the challenge of difficult reading passages\") might have been ambiguous and, therefore, could not be clearly distinguished from other intrinsic motivational items. However, another possible explanation is that it is actually intrinsic value that underlies those four reading motivational aspects. For example, students may enjoy the challenge of reading not so much because they have confidence in their reading ability, but rather because they simply like reading. In short, as in the case of Wigfield and Guthrie's study (1997), many of the aspects proposed by Wigfield and Guthrie (1995) and investigated in the present study did not cluster as predicted.\nOn the other hand, there are interesting similarities between the structural components of English reading motivation found in this study, and the motivational constructs delineated in expectancy value theory, upon which Wigfield and Guthrie's theory of reading motivation is largely based. As mentioned earlier, expectancy-value theory proposes that motivation is comprised of the following constructs: Expectancy for Success, Attainment Value, Intrinsic Value, Extrinsic Utility Value, and Cost. Considering that Expectancy for Success is the equivalent of efficacy beliefs, and Attainment Value is defined as students' perceived importance of engaging in a task, one can observe that four out of five constructs proposed in expectancy-value theory were identified in this study, i.e., Expectancy for Success (labelled Reading Efficacy in this study), Intrinsic Value (labelled Intrinsic Value of Reading), Extrinsic Utility Value (labelled Extrinsic Utility Value of Reading), and Attainment Value (labelled Importance of Reading). What can be speculated from the results of this data set is that different facets of reading motivation may be so interrelated that they can be better explained by a more encompassing motivational model such as the expectancy value theory.\nIn the present study, Gardner's concept of Integrative Orientation was also investigated in order to see whether integrative orientation, which is hypothesized to tap into the uniqueness of second/foreign language learning, could be a distinct construct in the domain of reading in an EFL context. Although many of the items indicative of Integrative Orientation loaded together on one factor, they were intermingled with other items concerning students' perceived usefulness of learning to read in English in terms of a future goal. When examining such Integrative Orientation items as \"I am learning to read in English because I might study abroad in the future,\" and \"By being able to read in English, I hope to more deeply understand the lifestyles and cultures of English speaking countries (such as America and England),\" one can construe that they are also closely related with students' perceived usefulness of learning to read in English. The only difference between these two sets of items is that the former is associated with integratively oriented goals while the latter is not. If that is the case, Integrative Orientation may not be such a distinct construct, at least when it comes to motivation to read in a foreign language, and may be better explained, again, by a more all-embracing motivational construct, namely Extrinsic Utility Value. This may be due to the fact that the present study was carried out in an EFL setting. The result of this study corresponds to findings of some other motivational studies (Au, 1988; Crookes & Schmidt, 1991; D\u00f6rnyei, 1990; Ely, 1986; Kraemer, 1993; Muchnick & Wolfe, 1982; Oller, 1981) carried out in EFL contexts that also failed to find the significance of integrative motivation as suggested by Gardner. In Japan where EFL students have very limited contact with the target language and culture, it can be assumed that their desire to integrate themselves into the target community is rather weak, and consequently cannot be discriminated from other reasons for reading in English such as \"getting a job that uses what I studied in English reading class\" and \"being able to read English newspapers and magazines.\"\nIn a nutshell, although the present study was designed and carried out in order to investigate whether the hypothesis that motivation to read in a foreign language may be, to a certain degree, independent of general motivational constructs, the findings did not support this. Instead, the results suggest that foreign language reading motivation closely resembles more general forms of motivation as laid out in expectancy-value theory. Although more research is needed to verify this point, the results of this research confirm the multidimensionality of reading motivation, and suggest that it is rash to label certain students as either motivated or not motivated to read. This line of research is also essential in order to explore the relationship between reading motivation and reading behavior.\nReferences\nAmes, C. (1992).

There are many programs and gimmicks out there that claim to have the magic answer to languages. Unfortunately it doesnt exist, at least not yet. So let me list a few reasons why Language Software and Programs are horrible.\n1. Blind Memorization: Most programs have you memorizing tons of vocabulary without teaching you how to use it. Its like giving you oil paints without teaching you the art of painting. Yes, you need vocabulary but computers are not yet able to create real life speaking situations that a human teacher can. You have to speak with natives in order to learn how and when to use certain words\n2. Predictable: All of these programs are predictable and give you the same questions and answers every time. If you try to speak with someone and they dont ask or answer the way you have memorized you are up a creek. Humans are not predictable therefore you need to learn languages in a manner that will prepare you for spontaneous situations. Practicing and building your comfort level, confidence, and intuitive understanding will you gain the agility of a native speaker.\n3. Out Dated: These programs take years to develop and after being on the market for a couple of years they are no longer relevant to todays vocabulary and subjects. To overcome this you must read current materials in the language, like newspapers, and speak to natives.\n4. You Dont Advance: You do learn new words and concepts but your ability to use them in an actual conversation does not change. You do increase the depth of your knowledge but not your skill. This can only be done by seeking out opportunities to use your new found understanding.\nAfter making my point I would like to say that if you have realistic expectations of your language software it can be helpful, but it will only teach you the basics. These programs are good at what they do, but are not the answer to learning to speak a language fluently. Language learning is a life long commitment that will take a combination of different learning tools and efforts to achieve your goals.\n"}, {"score": 1429.6909, "uuid": "3bb82452-dce6-5afe-a27f-380e014d8fd4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300wb-52-26274", "target_hostname": "languageandhumor.com", "target_uri": "http://languageandhumor.com/blog/page/12/", "page_rank": 1.174127e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>Language</em> and Humor Blog | <em>Language</em>, linguistics, English, <em>foreign</em> <em>languages</em>", "snippet": "<em>A</em> good book about play, <em>language</em> play, creativity, and <em>language</em> <em>learning</em> <em>is</em> Guy Cook\u2019s <em>Language</em> Play, <em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> (Oxford University Press, 2000).", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted on September 29, 2006 by Kevin\nTwo professors, sign language researcher Ronnie Wilbur and animator Nicoletta Adamo-Villani, at Purdue University (Indiana, U.S.) are developing computer animation and virtual reality (VR) using motion capture of human signing to teach math/maths to signing Deaf children via American Sign Language.\nFrom Animation World Magazine :\nTwo Purdue University professors are studying how to use computer animation and virtual reality to teach deaf children in grades K through 4 about mathematics principles, and to communicate math terminology using American Sign Language. The reason for the project is that, for deaf children, reading instruction is delayed; therefore most kids in this age group cannot use traditional textbooks. They also aren\u2019t able to take full advantage of secondary learning opportunities that non-disabled kids have, such as television and dinner table conversation, and their parents may not be fluent enough in sign language to teach them about math.\nProject sites (with demos):\nVR: Signed Math in an Immersive Learning Environment (SMILE)\nThe VR of counting money in a toy store and so forth should be useful and fun. However, most deaf children have hearing parents and siblings, who often don\u2019t sign. This can be isolating if the child can\u2019t (or can\u2019t yet) adequately communicate via oral-aural language. I just hope teachers and parents are careful not to take too much time away from interacting with other humans in a natural visual language in order to have limited interaction between the child and animated characters.\n"}, {"score": 1422.2921, "uuid": "c48c9b97-9717-5263-a5dc-3d7d819948d5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0501wb-32-02839", "target_hostname": "www.listenandlearnusa.com", "target_uri": "http://www.listenandlearnusa.com/blog/tag/language-learning/", "page_rank": 1.3622778e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Listen &amp; Learn \u00bb <em>language</em> <em>learning</em>", "snippet": "Posted on February 16th, 2012 in <em>Language</em> acquisition, Research | No Comments \u00bb One of the most often heard excuses for not <em>learning</em> <em>a</em> new <em>language</em> <em>is</em> \u201cI\u2019m too old\u201d.

Mr Shevlin was awarded grant by the Fulbright Commission for Summer Language Study and spent a month this summer in Galway, staying with an Irish-speaking family and studying at the National University of Ireland.\nCurrently Mr Shevlin\u2019s working towards a bachelor\u2019s degree in Irish Studies and learning Irish at night. On top of his study commitments and work, he teaches an Irish class and is involved in Irish cultural events. Sweetly, he even met his girlfriend through mutual love of the language, posting on a dating website that he was looking for \u201cgr\u00e1 mo chro\u00ed,\u201d or \u201cthe love of my heart.\u201d\nThis just goes to show that you can not only learn a language whilst working, but find love too!\nPosted on October 14th, 2011 in Bilingualism , Language acquisition , Languages | No Comments \u00bb\nAn interesting interview at the Huffington Post with Professor Fran\u00e7ois Grosjean aims to bust some myths about what it means to be bilingual.\nProfessor Grosjean is a world recognised expert on bilingualism and Emeritus Professor of psycholinguistics at Neuch\u00e2tel University in Switzerland. He lists a number of myths about bilingualism, including that bilinguals have equal knowledge of their languages, and that \u2018true\u2019 bilinguals must have learnt both their languages as a child.\nInterestingly, Grosjean also gives hope to those who feel they\u2019ve \u2018forgotten\u2019 a language they once learned. Whilst he qualifies the statement by saying that there has not been much study in the area, \u201cit would appear that much more remains than we would have thought at first. The language just needs to be reactivated and aspects of it relearned.\u201d It\u2019s never too late to try and become bilingual.\nTake a look at the rest of this fascinating interview .\nPosted on September 17th, 2011 in Culture , Hints and Tips , Language acquisition , Technology | No Comments \u00bb\nTwitter is a useful language-learning tool, and now it\u2019s available in more languages!\nIt\u2019s just launched in simplified and traditional Chinese, Tagalog, Malay and Hindi, bringing the total number of language available to 17. Other languages that will soon be added to Twitter\u2019s translation center are Danish, Swedish, Polish, Hungarian, Norwegian and Finnish.\nTwitter relies on volunteers for translation of these languages, so if you\u2019re a speaker, why not head over to their translation center and help out?\nIf you\u2019re learning one of Twitter\u2019s supported languages, why not try tweeting to improve your written language skills? You could also connect with fellow language learners. It may take some time to click, but Twitter is about conversations, not just expressing your thoughts to the world. So make sure you follow tweeters who talk about things you\u2019re interested in \u2013 and then engage with them!\nPosted on September 10th, 2011 in Hints and Tips , Language acquisition | No Comments \u00bb\nEveryone has a different motivation for learning a new language, whether it\u2019s to communicate with family members, a dream to move countries or simply as a way of meeting new people.\nApparently, something that isn\u2019t motivational for a lot of people is money. The Swedish government has a programme rewarding immigrants for passing their SFI (Swedish for Immigrants) course \u2013 but less than a fifth of the money allocated has been spent. Students are offered bonuses of up to 12,000 kroner, or around $1900.\nThe motivation behind the programme is to help ease immigrants into Swedish society. But only some of the students saw the bonus as something worth working for; others struggle with the language and decide to take their time in classes. The integration minister, Erik Ullenhag, said:\n\u201cWe are trying to put out a very clear message from society that one of the most important ways to integrate into the Swedish community is to learn the language.\u201d (Source: The Local )\nWhat\u2019s your motivation for learning a new language?\nPosted on September 8th, 2011 in Culture , English , Language acquisition , Spanish | No Comments \u00bb\nDespite the dire warnings, Hurricane Irene passed through New York City barely leaving any damage. But one lasting effect of the hurricane (or rather Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s response to it) is a Twitter account that mocks the Mayor\u2019s attempts at Spanish.\nFrom an outsider\u2019s point of view, Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s willingness to learn a language spoken by many in his city and to try communicate with them better is an admirable thing. Given that his spoken Spanish sounds about as good as mine though, he has been criticised for not leaving important warnings up to someone with a better grasp of the language.\nEl Bloombito (aka Miguel Bloombito) is a parody of the Mayor\u2019s Spanish skills. Examples of tweets include:\nLos librariotequas del publico somos opening at el 12pm. Returno sus bookas! Que mucho fines!\nMuchos trees esta falling downo. No stando under los trees. Que splat!\nThe Mayor was asked about the account in a press conference and seemed to take it well. Interestingly, from this article from the New York Times it seems that Bloomberg has been learning Spanish since around 2002 and has a personal tutor for conversation classes. He\u2019s a busy man, but I would personally want my spoken skills to be much better after almost 10 years of practice!

In my personal opinion and experience, it depends on what type of sign language you are trying to learn. If you are trying to learn sign language for communication purposes, it is not too hard. If you are trying to learn sign language as a language, it can be difficult.\nI know from personal experience the difficulty of learning sign language as a language. For a short time, I was an employee of Gallaudet University in Washington, DC. As a new employee, I was required to take an American Sign Language class. I had a hard time in the class because no matter how hard I tried, my brain was too set in \"thinking straight English\" to be able to adjust to the different grammar challenges of American Sign Language.\nAbout.com readers were asked if they thought learning sign language was too hard. Many responses were posted, and what follows is an edited sampling of reader responses to the blog post, \" Is Learning Sign Language Too Hard? \"\n\"Learning any new language comes with its challenges. One that comes to mind is: Learning a language that does not provide auditory information to the student who relies heavily on this stream of information is that much more challenging. Can it be done? Yes. Can one become fluent? Yes. Are all hearing parents the most effective and appropriate language role model of ASL? Bo.\"\n- Lynn\n\"I am a hearing parent of a deaf child. I had limited experiences with deaf[ness] before my daughter was diagnosed. I was told to 'not embarrass yourself or the child by signing in public' and that she could learn to talk to get along in the hearing world. When she started creating baby signs to communicate, I gave in to sign language to be able to communicate with my child. I have since went back to college, got the degree and became a certified interpreter . Is it hard to learn sign language? I guess so, I'm still learning. Was all my hard work worth it? You better believe it! My daughter and I have a very close relationship...to this day, I have young deaf adults coming to me to explain something that their parents never did. I am proud that my daughter was able to learn from me and not have to depend on a teacher or an interpreter to explain life to her.\"\n- Gina\n\"I\u2019m deaf (not Deaf) and found learning sign language difficult. I took a basic course when I was 13 years old and, since I was the only student, I had nobody to practice with. Despite learning basic signs, I found it very difficult to speak in ASL. I understand better when someone else speaks to me in ASL in an average speed. ASL in a social aspect is too overwhelming for me with the fast speeds it has. It is for me the same as trying to hear a single word from a radio station.\"\n- Niq\n\"It\u2019s never easy to learn an additional language, especially after 13 or 14, but it was a lot easier for us to learn ASL than for our daughter to learn English\u2026\"\n- Charlie\n\"Yeah it is hard to learn ASL -- as with any language. As a parent, if you really care about your child you will learn ASL -- you don\u2019t have to get to an interpreter level, but you have to learn. How can you not want to communicate with your kids?\"\n- Robert\nResearch on the Difficulty of Learning Sign Language\nThe question of how difficult it is to learn sign language has been addressed in formal research studies. One such study,\"What's So Hard about Learning ASL?: Students'& Teachers' Perceptions\" was published in Sign Language Studies, issue number 75, Summer 1992. The study found that teachers felt it was more difficult than their students did.\nAnother, similar article in American Annals of the Deaf, Volume 143, No. 3, 1998, \"Why is learning sign language a challenge?\" looked at how some people mistakenly believe sign language is \"easy\" to learn. One reason for this belief is that some signs are simple, like \"eat.\" The truth, as the abstract for this article points out, is that \"Like all languages, it is not mastered easily beyond a basic level.\"\n"}], [{"score": 1416.9658, "uuid": "b638cb9f-0d79-5d3f-b98d-284e0ddc1973", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-76-29077", "target_hostname": "www.nightcourses.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nightcourses.com/learning_options/languages.html", "page_rank": 1.2238756e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Learning</em> Options - <em>Languages</em> - <em>Language</em> courses in Ireland - Spanish, French", "snippet": "Spanish <em>language</em> exchange - Free Hi guys, If you are looking for <em>a</em> Spanish <em>Language</em> Exchange in Ireland <em>or</em> in Spain you should visit the below link, <em>is</em> <em>a</em> website for Spanish people <em>who</em> wants to move to Ireland to learn English, so you will f ... english for <em>foreign</em> teachers Hi, I would like to know if", "explanation": null, "document": "LATEST\nLearning English through reading How many of you are there who did not need an English tutor and self studied using materials such as dictionary, books, magazines, Educational program (i.e. Spelling bee, Quiz program etc.) I know i never had t\u00a0...\n317 views | join the discussion\nSpanish for my daughter (8yrs) and myself Just wondering if anyone knows of any Spanish classes run for kids and adults at weekends, preferably the same times?

A new foreign language can be difficult to learn, and linguists agree. Here are some tips to stay motivated.\nRelated Articles\nExpat children and language learning\nSteven Pinker, for one, thinks the \u201clanguage instinct\u201d is lost somewhere around puberty. Children are linguistic geniuses, adults linguistic dolts. Pinker points out that Walter Kissinger (Henry\u2019s younger brother) has no German accent, though sixty years after his emigration, Henry famously does.\nThey came to the United States at the same time, in the crucial years around puberty. Walter\u2019s advantage, Pinker surmises, was being a few years younger than his brother when they moved. This allowed him to absorb more English and kick his accent. (According to Pinker, the accent is as much a part of the language instinct as\u00a0is grammar.)\nLearning a language in adulthood is difficult\u2014nothing can replace the childhood environment, much less the childhood brain. However, with patience and persistence, it can be done. To produce a foreign language requires more than lips, teeth and tongue\u2014it requires ears, eyes and mental agility. You must listen carefully and then imitate.\nLanguage is like jazz: both are spontaneous compositions derived from a finite set of elements (notes or words). But the jazz analogy may compel people to think that they simply don\u2019t have the talent. What they don\u2019t realize is how obsessively John Coltrane practiced, repeating scales and arpeggios over and over again to build up the skills he would need to make that freeform composition on the stage seem so effortless.\nIt is exactly the same way when composing a foreign language.\nI\u2019ve learned Spanish, German, French, Portuguese and Russian\u2014all post-puberty. And recently, I started Arabic\u2014by far the hardest language I\u2019ve studied. Though I was frustrated at first, now that I have a better teacher and a good textbook, I\u2019m making rapid progress. Every student of language is different, but here are some strategies that have helped me:\nSlow and steady\nRegular practice is by far the most important element in learning a language. Students often try to cram as much into their heads as fast as they can which leads to frustration and fatigue. If taking a class, they are exposed to the language only one to three times a week, plus the time they spend on homework.\nIt is far more helpful to spend five minutes twice a day, every day, thinking, reading and talking in the language. Where and when, though? As you learn, practice out loud whenever you are alone. While you walk to the train station, or sit in stop-and-go traffic, review to yourself. Start simple: \u201cI go to work. I am in the car. I live in New York.\u201d Repeat these basics over and over, and then vary the subject. \u201cSteve goes to work. Steve is in his car. Steve lives in New York.\u201d\nRepeat, repeat, repeat. You will then feel a thrill as you proceed to compound sentences, tenses, and modal verbs (should, would, must, may). \u201cI am going to work, because I have to. I live in New York, and I love it here.\u201d Those steps beyond baby talk are exciting.\nTake a class\nIf you live in any medium-sized city, a foreign-language class is not hard to find. If you are in a big city, you will be spoiled for choice. New York University, for example, offers dozens of classes in a wide variety of languages from Norwegian to Yiddish to Persian, for around USD450 a semester.\nAttending a class is the single best way to motivate yourself\u2014the desire to impress a teacher and classmates will help keep you on task. If you have the means to get a private tutor, even better. But be sure to get a recommendation from a knowledgeable friend\u2014not every native speaker is a good teacher.\n(Illustration above by Markus )\nTeach yourself\nLearning a foreign language all by yourself is extremely difficult\u2014and probably not a good idea if it\u2019s your first one. However, if you decide to go the autodidact route, make sure to buy top-notch books, audio CDs, and computer programs.\nA good book can get you far in a language with an easy spelling system, like Spanish or Italian. I\u2019ve found Routledge\u2019s \u201cColloquial\u201d series to be fairly good. But for languages with irregular spelling (French or Danish, say), or unfamiliar sounds (Chinese or Hindi), it\u2019s better to get a book that comes with audio CDs. The \u201cUltimate\u201d series from Random House has a straightforward, building-block structure, with practical vocabulary and lucid explanations.\nComputer software has something to offer as well. But don\u2019t expect miraculous results. I reviewed the Danish version of the widely marketed Rosetta Stone series here. Short version: you will learn grammar and vocabulary surprisingly quickly with this novel (and expensive) software, but you won\u2019t learn practical stuff at all.\nWhile focusing on grammar building blocks, the program sacrifices basic elements of conversation such as \u201chello\u201d or \u201cmy name is\u201d or \u201chelp!\u201d Though you\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cThere is not an elephant under the airplane,\u201d I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever have a reason to use this sentence in daily conversation.\nRosetta Stone has another drawback. Each lesson is structured exactly the same\u2014identical exercises in the same order. This is bad practice\u2014different languages pose different challenges. Also, many languages have structures Rosetta Stone isn\u2019t equipped to teach: the Arabic dual number (words have singular, dual and plural endings), the Russian verbal aspect system, the Spanish subjunctive and so forth are all distinctive. Rosetta\u2019s software does not address any of these eccentricities.\nSurround yourself\nWhenever possible, bring the language into your immediate world. The \u201c10 Minutes a Day\u201d series of books is generally useless, as if written for not particularly bright six-year-olds, but they do come with small stickers you can attach to items all around your house. This is an excellent vocabulary-building technique. If every time you reach for your coffee mug you see chashka (Russian for cup) and you say the word to yourself, it will stick in your head.\nNearly every language in the world can be found on the Internet. The BBC, in fact, broadcasts everything from Spanish to Bengali. (You can check out their 33-language menu here).\nAs you potter around the house, listen to the day\u2019s news in your language of choice. You don\u2019t need to understand everything, but this will both help you feel the rhythm and become accustomed to the accent. You\u2019ll get a crucial psychological boost when you can make out a few words, then phrases and sentences, in a row. Do this every few days and you\u2019ll be surprised by your progress.\nRead\nBBC.com also has written material that you can practice with. The news stories in each of those 33 languages are written in a clear, simple style for a worldwide audience. When you\u2019re ready, try to read a news story a week, especially about something you\u2019re familiar with.\nThis is crucial\u2014reading an article about unfamiliar material is distressingly complex. But if you know the subject, it can be pleasantly easy, since you\u2019ll be able to guess many unfamiliar words. You\u2019ll need to start out with a dictionary, but once you learn frequently-used words, you\u2019ll be able to go without it and guess most of the things you don\u2019t know.\nYou can also read books that have been translated from English into your chosen language\u2014all the better if it\u2019s a book you know. I have a copy of Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity in German, for example. Hornby\u2019s clear English is translated into similarly clear German, without some of the convoluted sentence structures many native Germans use. I know the original book and movie, so I myself can zip through it.\nWhen you are ready to move to the next level and read unfamiliar books in this language, ask a native which authors write in an easy, clear style. If you were helping a foreigner try to learn English, for example, you would suggest Hemingway, not David Foster Wallace. Similarly, someone learning German would do well to start with Kafka rather than Thomas Mann.\nFind a friend who speaks the language\nThis is obvious, but practice with a native speaker is enormously helpful. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a good friend who is a native speaker\u2014or best of all, a girlfriend/boyfriend or housemate (someone you see all the time)\u2014take advantage of him or her. Don\u2019t wait until you feel totally comfortable, or you\u2019ll never start. Make it fun, make it a routine, and do so early.\nRelax\nThe biggest hurdle to learning a language is psychological. If you\u2019re nervous about blundering through a new language in front of strangers, the best way to relax is to start slowly. At a local coffee shop staffed exclusively by young Polish blondes, I take my muffin and coffee away with a \u201cdziekuje.\u201d (Thank-you.)\nMy pronunciation isn\u2019t perfect, but it never fails to win a slightly surprised smile. Next step? I\u2019ll order the coffee in Polish, too. Then, I\u2019ll try \u201cgoodbye.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re ready and have the chance, smile and try speaking with your teacher in the corridor, your cute Russian co-worker, the man who sells you cigarettes, or the waiter at your favorite restaurant. See that grin? Most people love to see you make the effort, and they will be happy to see you break out new vocabulary and longer sentences.\nIf you kick yourself for every little slip-up (and you\u2019ll make many), you\u2019ll never progress. If you relax, simply communicate, and most of all enjoy, you can, with patience and effort, learn any language you want.\nBy Robert Lane Greene*\n*Lane Greene is an international correspondent for The Economist: he writes on American foreign policy and international politics for www.economist.com .

They learn new words at a breakneck rate and seem to easily absorb the language\u2019s complexities.\nThe good news is that you can learn from them.\nNobody is advising you to return to a juvenile state, but you can greatly benefit by \u201cbecoming a kid\u201d again.\nHere are 5 things you can do now to boost your\u00a0language learning skills\u2026\n1. Be Curious\nAs you know, children\u00a0are curious creatures.\nIt may land them in hot water, but it is also the key to learning.\u00a0Curiosity leads to discovery, which leads to pleasure.\nAnd pleasure leads to repetition, which leads to mastery.\nTry a little experiment. Find a translated copy of your favorite childhood book, and attempt to read it. You\u2019ll discover the joys of reliving your youth \u2014 while learning in the process.\nAlbert Einstein said his ideas could be credited to curiosity rather than talent. When you embrace this point of view, you\u2019ll be amazed at how much learning can feel like play!\n2. Immerse Yourself\nLinguists believe that babies begin to learn their language while in the womb. From then on, they\u2019re surrounded by the new language, well before they speak their first word.\nYou may not have the luxury of being completely immersed, but there are some tricks to help:\nRead books and magazines, listen to internet radio, and listen to CDs in the language\nTell yourself stories in the language\nTranslate road signs when you\u2019re at a red light\nPut Post-its on household items with the translated name\nThese methods are much more effective than vocabulary lists because your brain is hardwired to make contextual connections.\n3. Stop Being Self-Conscious\nToddlers babble in a \u201clanguage\u201d that sounds like gibberish to us. It\u2019s actually an imitation of the tone and rhythm they hear in adults.\nThey\u2019re completely unconcerned about who is listening, whether they\u2019re correct, or whether they sound silly.\nThere\u2019s a huge lesson here.\nIf you\u2019re mortified at the thought of being wrong or messing up pronunciation, you\u2019re more likely to keep quiet. This is like learning how to play the guitar by looking at it!\nLoosen your tongue. Risk your neighbors\u2019 quizzical looks by speaking to your flowers. If you meet a native speaker of the language you\u2019re learning, take the plunge by starting a conversation.\nYou won\u2019t learn if you don\u2019t try.\n4. Go Easy on Yourself\n\u201cMommy gone!\u201d \u201cCandy want!\u201d \u201cBig car!\u201d\nNone of the above are grammatically complete sentences, but you know what they mean, right?\nChildren don\u2019t bother with grammar, and you shouldn\u2019t get too hung up on it either. Grammar is important, but when you focus on nouns and phrases, it will naturally develop.\nIf you\u2019re setting rigid expectations for your language quest, stop now. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be more likely to quit altogether.\nKids make things as easy as possible for themselves, and so should you.\n5.

I forget where the drunk blind man threw the dart that we have been basing this on) and considering I myself started properly at age 21 , and how many people have been sharing their own success stories with me (if you have one, make sure to share it with all of us in the Fi3M forum\u2019s success stories section \u2013 the best ones will get showcased on the blog!) I hope to have the ammunition to destroy this pointless demotivator.\nThe most discouraging TED talk ever\nI\u2019ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they make remarks that they can\u2019t back up with relevant research, which serve no purpose but to discourage learners. But when they get taken seriously by the public, then I have to take a stand against it.\nAmong the worst examples include an otherwise interesting TED talk about The Linguistic genius of babies \u2013 in it she shows us a bullshit graph about the \u201ccritical period\u201d for learning a language where all hope is lost from age 17. She drives it home with the comment \u201cno scientists dispute this curve\u201d. Really now?\nShe also claims that age ONE is where we can can no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; \u201cYou and I can\u2019t do that\u2026 we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages\u201d. This is just ridiculous. After some focused training, and sometimes even just a few seconds of paying attention, and you\u2019ll hear it. In some cases, it\u2019s harder and takes a wee bit more time, but it\u2019s definitely not impossible.\nShe doesn\u2019t have a clue what she\u2019s talking about because she actually researches babies.\nThis stuff really pisses me off as the \u201cresearch\u201d tests in a context and environment that children are bound to win on anyway (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn\u2019t test in areas that adults would be better at. As far as I\u2019m concerned this is totally irrelevant research, as well as being unhelpful. I can\u2019t imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read some paper where kids came out on top\u2026 in classroom learning, and decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the kids don\u2019t.\nSeriously TED, you need to get me to speak up on one of your stages so I can undo the damage of this previous talker, as well as destroy people\u2019s own misconceptions. Millions of adults around the world learn languages to excellent levels fine all the time. Any sloppy research that comes up on this is arguing against an army of people that disprove it.\nLinguists who are working for the greater good\nFortunately this is not the case for all linguists, and now popular research is backing up what I\u2019ve been saying all along!\nI was just on Google plus , and my friend Joop shared this link with me so I thought I had to get it on the blog:\nAge no excuse for failing to learn a new language \u2013 New Scientist\nResearchers realised that there are crucial differences in how adults vs children learn and tried to demonstrate it in this research. When they did, surprise surprise, adults come out on top. Once again, for more specifics about how I think this works on a broader scale \u2013 read my post about how you are not too old to learn a language .\nLet me know your thoughts on this in the comments!\nWant more language learning tips and cool links delivered to your inbox, as well as two free chapters of the Language Hacking Guide ?

Can\u2019t wait to see what you have to write\u2026 don\u2019t be shy!!\nJeff Winchell\nHey Benny,\nI found this summary ( http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html ) of why typical kids learn languages easier than typical adults, which doesn\u2019t get into FMRI research about the brains of kids under 5:\n\u201cInnate abilities aside, children have a number of powerful\nadvantages:\n1) They can devote almost their full time to it. Adults consider half an hour\u2019s study\na day to be onerous.2) Their motivation is intense. Adults rarely have to spend much of their time in the\ncompany of people they need to talk to but can\u2019t; children can get very little of\nwhat they want without learning language(s).3) Their peers are nastier. Embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human\nbeings (I owe this insight to Marvin Minsky\u2019s The Society of Mind, but it was most memorably\nexpressed by David Berlinski (in Black Mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to\ndepression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full\noriginal intensity). Dealing with a French waiter is nothing compared with the\nvicious reception in store for a child who speaks funny.\u201d\nSo maybe you can use this to turn the subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why they too can learn as easy as kids. Your own adventures are examples of the first two points. I realize that you don\u2019t like to put yourself in situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, I find that even as an adult, I get #3 from time to time. Particularly at work. I don\u2019t like it, but I suppose it is good for me.\n\u2190 Older Comments\nThe Language Hacking League\nJoin thousands and get FREE language hacking tips, cool links, site updates & two free chapters of the Language Hacking Guide!\nNo Spam.

What is the profile of the students on Cactus courses?\nOur evening courses are for adults of all ages (min 18 years old) and nationalities and, where offered, for all levels from beginners upwards. For most courses, the average age range will be mid 20s to mid 40s. However many younger and older students also take these courses.\n3. How soon do I have to enrol?\nThe earlier the better to ensure that we have the numbers correctly. If we don\u2019t receive enough bookings for courses, we will cancel them and the course you wanted may disappear off the site.\n4. Can I join a class in the second week?\nYes, if there is space in the classes we can take bookings for students to join the class in the second week, although there will be no discount to the price. You will need to call us to check availability. After the second week we do not allow any students to join the course as this is too disruptive to the learning program.\n5. How do I know there is space on a course?\nA date will show next to the course or the course will not show at all on the language/ location page. All courses with dates have space on the course.\n6. What is the minimum number of students?\nThe minimum class size refers to the number of students required to run a group course. This number varies depending on the course and location. The vast majority of our courses meet this requirement, but on occasion some course variations don\u2019t. In these instances it is up to Cactus\u2019 discretion whether the course will run. We always aim to run all courses as advertised, but cannot guarantee that this will be possible where the minimum class size is not met.\nWhat happens if the minimum class size is not met?\nShould your course be affected, we will contact you directly to discuss your options, which may include:\nMoving onto an equivalent course in a different location.\nReconfiguring your original course to an intensive course, taught in a smaller group. The course duration in this instance is likely to be reduced, due to the significantly intensified learning experience and progress achieved in such small groups, which will mean that you will cover the course material in a much shorter amount of time.\nDeferring a term and starting your course at a later date of your choice, for which you will be given priority.\nConverting your course fee to a Cactus credit, which can be used as full or part payment for any of our products worldwide.\nA refund of your course fee in line with our general refund policy .\n7. Can you issue a letter of invitation in order for me to get / extend a Visa to study with Cactus?\nNo, we cannot offer such letters as all our courses are part time and are not eligible for this process.\nIf you have further questions regarding Booking & Availability please email us.\n\u00bb Course Information\nPlease visit our dates and times page .\n2. Why learn a language?\nPeople learn languages for a number of reasons: some for work or business, some for education or to put on their CVs, and some merely for the pleasure of being able to communicate with different people and cultures. Any trip abroad is greatly enhanced if you can say a few words, let alone if you can actually have a conversation with the locals!\n3. How much will I learn during my course?\nWhat will I learn?\nOur Course Outlines give an overview of the content and learning framework of Cactus part-time group courses and include themes, grammar and vocabulary you can typically expect to cover. These are intended as a guide only and our teachers may at times adapt the course content to suit the specific level, aims and interests of the class.\nWhat progress will I have made by the end of the level?\nOur 'Can Do' Statements provide a guide to what you can expect to achieve at each level and also shows what progress you can expect to make if you stick with it and carry on studying subsequent levels. These are guides only and other factors will affect your rate of progress, e.g. your prior language skills and base level, how proficient you are at picking up new languages, your level of participation in class and revision (and homework) outside of class. It will partially also depend on how difficult (or dissimilar) the language you are learning is (from your native language).\n4. How do you choose your teachers?\nAll our teachers are native speakers or have native-speaker fluency in the language they teach. They have specialist qualifications and experience in Teaching a Foreign Language to Adults.\n5. Do teachers speak English during the lessons?\nVery rarely, because the most effective way to learn or improve your language skills is through complete immersion in the language. However, the occasional explanation or vocabulary term may be explained in English, and teachers are very used to teaching - and making themselves understood by - students who may have little or no prior knowledge of the language.\n6. Do I receive a qualification or certificate?\nAt the end of your course you receive a certificate of participation, sent to you by email. This confirms the language and level of course you have taken. Our course levels are based on two internationally recognised systems, so you have a universally accepted reference for your studies. Read more\nImportant - Please note that you must complete the online end of course questionnaire sent to you in order to get your certificate! This will also be sent to you by email at the end of your course.\n7. How much homework is typically involved?\nYour teacher will give you approximately one hour's worth of formal homework per week but we would recommend you do ten minutes per day of self study in order to assimilate and retain the information you are learning.\n8. When will I receive my coursebook?\nYour teacher will give you your coursebook on day two of your course. Please note we often use one textbook over two or more levels, and this is factored into the prices of the courses. Should the same book be used in the next level you are taking, you will not receive another copy. Your book is chosen by our team of language teachers. They have chosen the most suitable book for the level of the class, with the most communicative approach possible.\n9. What should I do if my class is too easy / difficult for me?\nIf you have just completed your first lesson and are feeling a little overwhelmed, then don't worry. Cactus language courses are taught in the target language, as full immersion is widely recognised as the most effective way to learn a language. You may find this a little daunting at first, especially if you have previously been used to bi-lingual tuition. Read \" Help, I don't understand my teacher! \" a first-hand account of full immersion.\nHowever, if you are attending a 5-week or a 10-week course, and find that you are really struggling to keep up, or finding the course content too easy, you can switch classes up until your 3rd lesson. Please speak to your teacher and contact us . We will assess the situation and look to move you to a class more suited to your ability (subject to availability). If this is not possible, there are other options, including deferring a term. Otherwise our general refund policy will apply.\n10. Will I get a copy of the CD / listening materials that are used in the class?\nNo, our coursebook CDs are designed to be used in class and with a teacher, they are not designed for self study. However, if you would like to buy a copy of the listening material that goes with your coursebook, you can either order online or at the shop in London www.lclib.com . You will get a 10% discount on books and 15% on dictionaries if you mention that you are a Cactus student!\n11. What do I do if I am going to miss a lesson during the course?\nWe recommend that you tell your teacher as soon as you know that you are going to miss a class. Your teacher can then email you with an outline of what was covered in the class you missed, along with any homework set and what part of the textbook was used. In the interests of course continuity, please note you will not be able to take an alternative lesson with another class at another centre.\n12. What do I do if I am going to miss the first lesson?\nPlease do let us know so that we can pass a message on to your teacher.\n13. What if my teacher is ill during the course?\nIf your teacher is ill during the term we will organise a cover teacher to take your lesson. If no cover teacher is available we will either reschedule the lesson to take place on a different day or give you a refund for the class (depending on the circumstances).\n14. How big are the classes?\nTo ensure optimal course quality and enjoyment, our maximum class size is 15 students per class.\nNote: Cactus cannot offer any lessons on a trial basis.\n\u00bb Languages\n1. How do I know what level I am?\nIf you are unsure where to start or progress to, take our online level test and read our level descriptions for guidance.\n2.

The winner will be announced on the weekend!\nWelcome to Back to School Week here at Simple Homeschool! This week I\u2019ll bring you reviews and awesome chances to win\u2013perfect for back to school planning time.\nToday I\u2019m giving away a foreign language program from Rosetta Stone .\nRosetta Stone is widely known and recognized as one of the most effective language programs out there, so I was excited to try it for myself. They sent me Italian Level 1 , which I chose because my husband and I are planning to go to Italy next year for our 14th anniversary.\nRosetta Stone call their approach to language learning Dynamic Immersion . This means they recreate the method used when learning our native language to help learn a new one.\nUsing sights and sounds presented on the screen the learner naturally\u2013 without translation \u2013begins to pick up words, phrases, and sentences. From the very first lesson the student begins to build a foundation, guided by the pictures, written words, and language pronounced by a native speaker. The program allows you to proceed at your own pace, repeating sections as many times as necessary.\nMy Italian Level 1 arrived with a headset and microphone, which plug in to complete the speaking/pronunciation side of the course. (One tip: When being prompted to repeat a phrase, I found it worked better if I allowed a short pause after the beep before answering.) The program distinguishes between adult voices and those of children for greater accuracy.\nYou can set up multiple students to use the same language level; it will track each student\u2019s progress individually. The homeschool dashboard allows you to see clearly what each person has completed and what remains to be done. It also tracks grades and percentages\u2013making it quite simple for a homeschooling parent to use.\nI also found Rosetta Stone\u2019s customer service to be exceptional. Just a couple of weeks after receiving my program, the following email appeared in my inbox:\nSarah also called me to see if there was anything I needed, providing the type of support that would be especially valuable to a homeschooling parent using the program with multiple students. Rosetta Stone makes a point to stay on the cutting edge of technology. This year the company released an app that allows you to sync your coursework on your iPad.\nRosetta Stone makes learning a new language more natural (and really, more fun!) than any other language program I\u2019ve seen before. I have been sincerely impressed with my experience and look forward to continuing my language study and introducing it to my children as well.\nOne Simple Homeschool reader will receive a foreign language program from Rosetta Stone , in the language of your choice!\nHow to Win\nEveryone has two chances to win. Here\u2019s how:\n1. Comment on this post, answering this question: Rosetta Stone offers over 25 different languages \u2013which one would you or your children choose to study?

I recently asked Julia a few questions about her products and how they can help make travel time easier for Traveling Moms.\u00a0 She also suggested some games for kids to play while traveling that incorporate language learning.\nCulture Traveling Mom: Please tell us how your products can help make travel time easier for parents.\nPimsleur: Little Pim foreign language DVDs provide educational entertainment for your kids during travel times, and they will amaze you with how many words they can learn in Spanish, French or Chinese in one plane or car ride! Our \u201cvocabulary booster apps\u201d are also very easy to use and affordable ($1.99 each) even for kids as young as two, and reinforce the words taught in the DVD series. The flash cards provide a great activity for parents and kids to do together while on the go, and the parents do not need to speak the language themselves, as all our products come with easy to use phonetic guides.\nCulture Traveling Mom: What is the value of teaching a foreign language to our children?\nPimsleur: There is a more of a need than ever for our children to learn two languages, not only for the social and cultural benefits, but to become active citizens of our increasingly global economy.\u00a0 Proficiency in foreign languages and an understanding of other cultures used to be a \u201cnice to have\u201d but have really become essential skills in the twenty-first century. \u00a0If they start learning young, they will have better accents, learn new vocabulary with ease, and jump start a life-long interest in language learning.\u00a0 Children who can speak another language will have their pick of the best jobs when they grow up, and will be at ease living and working in more than one country.\nCulture Traveling Mom: What is the Pimsleur approach and how does it differ from other language-learning products? Why is the best one for children?\nPimsleur: My father, Dr. Paul Pimsleur, created the Pimsleur Method, which is an audio only method that allows adults to get conversational quickly in a foreign language. I grew up in the language teaching business and was inspired by my father\u2019s method to create a children\u2019s version that introduces kids to a second language at the age they learn best, which is before the age of six. Our Little Pim DVDs use the \u201cEntertainment Immersion Method\u201d, which allows even very young children to start learning and speaking a second language via total immersion (with optional English subtitles for their grown ups). The method is a mix of real kids doing everyday activities, and Little Pim the Panda, the teacher, introducing and repeating simple words and phrases. Each 3-DVD set teaches 360 words and phrases, and the kids are exposed to native speakers with perfect accents.\nCulture Traveling Mom: When should a parent start teaching their children foreign languages?\nPimsleur: The earlier you start the better. It\u2019s never too young to start introducing your child to a second language and it will not interfere with their English language learning. Babies and toddlers can listen to CDs and books and as they get older, you can introduce DVDs and interactive games.\nCulture Traveling Mom: How can a child have fun and learn a foreign language at the same time?\nPimsleur: Little Pim the panda makes language learning fun. Kids love watching his adventures and want to watch him over and over again. When they watch, and repeat after Little Pim, they learn. We know no child is going to tug on her mom\u2019s pant leg and say \u201cI want to learn Mandarin Chinese!\u201d but she will say \u201cI want to watch the panda!\u201d\nCulture Traveling Mom: What are some games that you can suggest for kids to play while traveling that incorporate language learning?\nPimsleur:\n1) Play a game where every child gets a point for naming an object you see out the window in another language. Whoever gets the most points gets a treat at the next rest stop or upon arrival. You can help out by naming objects the first time (a tree = \u201cun arbre\u201d or a car = \u201cune voiture\u201d) and your kids can call them out the next time.\n2) Print out the Little Pim coloring pages from our web site and have kids color them in the back seat (you\u2019ll need crayons and a lap desk or a hard cover book to lean). Each coloring page teaches a new word or phrase. Go to GAMES on the web site and print out up to 10 pictures of Little Pim to color in, with vocabulary included.\n3) Play music in a foreign language and encourage your kids to sing along\n4) Bring flash cards and award prizes for the child who gets the most right, or with one child, a small treat if they can get 5 right in a row.\n5) Get \u201ccountable\u201d snacks (like peanuts, grapes or raisins) and count off in the foreign language. See how high you can get before forgetting how to say it! The winner gets their pick of snacks to eat.\nCulture Traveling Mom: Are any of your products useful for kids to use on a trip?\nPimsleur: The digital downloads are very convenient to bring on a trip, as are the flash cards (which come in a sturdy box that is great for on the go). If you are traveling with a DVD player, bring along the DVDs. The apps are a great go-to game if you have an iTouch, iPhone or iPad (search \u201cWord Bag\u201d or \u201cTalking Coloring Book\u201d in iTunes).\nCulture Traveling Mom: When a family is traveling in a country where English is not the native language, what is the best way to get the kids immersed and interested in that language?\nPimsleur: A few weeks before your trip, start introducing the language of the country you\u2019ll be visiting by playing CDs and DVDs and reading your children books that expose them to the culture of the country. If you can, set aside a special time to learn with them (such as \u201cItalian breakfast every Wednesday\u201d or \u201cSpanish at bath time\u201d) as then kids will be able to know when to switch into that learning mode and you will also have a set time to bring these materials to their attention. Above all, try to make it fun! No vocabulary drills or memorization \u2013 just try to teach them a few simple words and phrases and show them what you love about the place you are visiting (the food, the music, the traditions, etc). They will have an even better time when they get there if they know a bit of what to expect and can speak a few words to make their needs known. They will pick up much more vocabulary when they are there, so no need to make that a chore before you go.\nCulture Traveling Mom: Does Pimsleur offer any downloadables or online material for kids to take on a trip?\nPimsleur: We offer all our DVDs as digital downloads (35 minutes per DVD) that play on any computers or handheld devices such as the iPhone, iTouch, or iPad. They cost $14.95 per 35 minute DVD or a reduced price of $41.95 for three DVDs.

So why should our kids learn Chinese?\nMany, many children learn Chinese\nAs rising numbers of young kids learn Chinese in American schools, the hottest new language trend may leave some parents scratching their heads. Why should our kids learn Chinese, when so many children in China are already fluent in English?\nReuters estimated in February 2006 that there are over 500 million English speakers in China and India, a figure which exceeds the number of \"mother-tongue\" speakers from the United States and Britain. Within the next decade, the number of foreign students studying English as a second language is projected to peak at around 2 billion.\nWhile English may be the language everyone is listening to and learning today, within the next 10 or 15 years, it will likely find itself sharing the world's spotlight. Whether or not kids learn Chinese today, experts predict that they will face a different world\u2014with a changing linguistic landscape\u2014by the time they reach adulthood.\n\"English Next\" recommends children learn Chinese now\nLast year, a research study commissioned by the British Council concluded that the lack of students fluent in a foreign language in both Britain and the United States will eventually weaken the competitiveness of both countries. The report, entitled \"English Next,\" positively brims with reasons why kids should learn Chinese.\nThe report highlights the economic advantages of more and better language education and the risks of remaining a largely monolingual culture and nation. Because of the current boom in the Chinese economy, the British Council is encouraging kids to learn Chinese today, expecting that their greater knowledge and broader experience may give them significant advantages in the globalized workplace of tomorrow. David Graddol, the main author of the \"English Next\" report, observes that in a world where everybody speaks English, being a native speaker from Britain or the United States does not, by itself, carry much weight. (This explains, in part, the loss of US jobs to international outsourcing.) However, the ability to speak several languages could prove to be extremely advantageous, and kids who learn Chinese will put themselves at the top of the multilingual list. Today, nearly 1.4 billion people speak Chinese\u2014nearly three times the number of English speakers.\nValuable lessons for kids who learn Chinese\nBut the advantages of learning Chinese, or any other language, are about much more than numbers\u2014these benefits are not limited to an edge in geopolitics or economic competition. Michael Levine, director of the Asia Society in New York, stressed the tremendous value of teaching Chinese to children, during an interview with The Christian Science Monitor. Referencing the impact of rapid globalization and the economic rise of China, he suggests that our educational system has a responsibility to prepare children for the demands of their future.\n\"The question is when, not whether, the schools are going to adjust,\" Levine said. The Asia Society has helped to launch five Chinese language immersion programs in New York public schools.\nWhen kids learn to speak Chinese, Levine notes, they benefit from an expanded cultural awareness. \"Language is a look in,\" he told The Christian Science Monitor. \"One doesn't need to be proficient in Chinese languages in order to do business in China. But the exposure and the motivation to show that one understands and respects the Chinese culture is really half the battle won.\"\nIn Chicago, the municipal school system has proven very ambitious in launching Chinese language immersion programs in over 20 public elementary schools, an initiative that has drawn considerable attention.\nThe investment firm Goldman Sachs has demonstrated its commitment to \"putting the world into world-class education\" by joining with the Asia Society in awarding prizes for Excellence in International Education, a number of which have gone to programs focused on teaching Chinese language and culture, including one to Newton North and Newton South High Schools in Massachussetts, the nation's longest-running student and teacher-exchange program with China.\nStephanie Bell-Rose, the president of The Goldman Sachs Foundation, stresses the necessity of enriching young Americans' knowledge of and exposure to other cultures and languages. She says, \"If young Americans are to take on challenging global leadership roles, they must possess a deep understanding of and appreciation for other cultures, economies, history and languages.\"\nThe rapid changes around the globe represent new needs and new directions for children of all ages (as well as adults), and new opportunities for bringing children to a broader and a bigger world\u2014and that big, broad world to them. Kids who learn Chinese and English will be ready to join the global conversation and take advantage of all the world has to offer.\n"}, {"score": 1295.2175, "uuid": "6cc58e49-6699-5d07-bc1b-7aa61aad99e6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-28-06717", "target_hostname": "www.everydaylanguagelearner.com", "target_uri": "http://www.everydaylanguagelearner.com/2012/02/13/language-learning-lessons-from-guitar-zero/", "page_rank": 1.1936645e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> Lessons from Guitar Zero | The Everyday <em>Language</em> Learner", "snippet": "If you are reading this though, you are probably an <em>adult</em> <em>who</em> understands intimately the feeling of fear <em>or</em> embarrassment that prevents you from speaking <em>or</em> stepping up to the mic <em>or</em> picking up your guitar to play for <em>a</em> group even though you are still <em>learning</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "You Are Here: Home \u00bb Misc. , Self Directed Learning \u00bb Language Learning Lessons from Guitar Zero\nLanguage Learning Lessons from Guitar Zero\ngovernment,politics news,politics news,politics\nGuitar Zero author, Gary Marcus.\nLast weekend as I was doing some Saturday morning chores around the house I found NPR on the ipod and it was like spending time with an old friend.\u00a0 Living in Turkey, I have forgone some of my favorite programs like A Prairie Home Companion and This American Life.\u00a0 Occasionally though I\u2019ll find Morning Edition or All Things Considered on the NPR website to get a little update on the state of the news in the States.\u00a0 Today in fact I discovered that there is a presidential election coming up this fall! \u2013 just kidding, I\u2019m not that out of touch.\u00a0 I actually listened to Science Friday as I scrubbed toilets and washed dishes and was excited to hear an interview with Gary Marcus, the author of Guitar Zero: The New Musician and the Science of Learning .\nMarcus is a professor of psychology at New York University and studied language acquisition as a graduate student.\u00a0 The premise of the book is his quest to learn guitar as a nearly 40 year old adult and his documentation and research of the process.\u00a0 Professor Marcus was interested in learning about how we learn as adults and as I listened I realized that there were loads of connections between what he was saying and language learning.\nHere is how the book begins:\nAre musicians born or made? All my life I wanted to become musical, but I always assumed that I never had a chance. My ears are dodgy, my fingers too clumsy. I have no natural sense of rhythm and a lousy sense of pitch. I have always loved music but could never sing, let alone play an instrument; in school I came to believe that I was destined to be a spectator, rather than a participant, no matter how hard I tried.\nIt seems a fitting way to begin looking at Guitar Zero because I so often hear people talk about not having a \u2018natural talent\u2019 or not being \u2018good\u2019 at learning languages.\u00a0 They may never have read about the \u2018critical period hypothesis\u2019 but somehow they have come to believe it.\u00a0 And so while Professor Marcus uses language learning as a springboard for discussing learning to play guitar as an adult, I\u2019d like to try to extrapolate back to language learning some of the comments he made in the interview on Science Friday.\nI have only just begun to read the book and so I want to comment on a few of the things said in the interview and see what applications we can make from them as everyday language learners.\u00a0 ( click here to listen to the NPR interview )\nOne main theme discussed in the interview is this idea that kids somehow have a greater ability to learn new things than adults, that a certain point comes around puberty where the human brains sort of locks up and new learning becomes more difficult if not impossible.\u00a0 In second language acquisition theory this is known as the critical period hypothesis.\u00a0 Marcus points out that this theory\u2019s argument is getting weaker and weaker as more and more research is done.\u00a0 He does point out two factors that make it seem like kids do better.\u00a0 But of course these aren\u2019t related to any sort of critical period, but rather to kids being kids and adults, unfortunately, being adults.\nPatience\nKids seem unfazed watching the same Barney cartoon a hundred times.\u00a0 Give a kid and instrument and they will patiently play it for hours with no real concern that they are unable to play a tune yet.\u00a0 This allows kids more repetition than adults who have little patience to stick with something in which an immediate sense of accomplishment is lacking.\nI often encourage language learners to listen, watch or read the same stories repeatedly.\u00a0 Many find this a difficult task.\u00a0 To learners driven by ideas of productivity and outcomes, watching the same movie twice can seem a maddening idea.\nInhibition\nKids don\u2019t care.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care if they sound bad. They don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t keep a beat.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care what others think because they haven\u2019t yet figured out that what others think is somehow important.\u00a0 And so kids just let it go, they have fun, they make noise and speak jibberish.\u00a0 If you are reading this though, you are probably an adult who understands intimately the feeling of fear or embarrassment that prevents you from speaking or stepping up to the mic or picking up your guitar to play for a group even though you are still learning.\nI was once told to \u201cget used to the idea that you are going to be the town clown\u201d as a beginning language learner.\u00a0 In my free guide to motivation and commitment I encourage language learners to \u201ccheck their ego at the door.\u201d\u00a0 Our inhibitions only slow our progress down.\nTime, Effectiveness and Talent\nProfessor Marcus discusses several other ideas in between the stories and examples he shares during the course of the interview.\u00a0 He also parses out some great advice for adults who want to begin to learn something new.\nMalcolm Gladwell\u2019s idea of the 10,000 hour rule comes up and Marcus agrees with the assessment that to truly master a complex skill, 10,000 hours seems to be a close equivalent to the time needed to really become great at something. He does add a few important additions though.\u00a0 First, skills are different.\u00a0 Learning to play the guitar might require more hours to master than learning to play the bongo drum.\u00a0 Learning to speak a new language will take more time to master than learning to paint a house.\u00a0 But time \u2013 and lots of it \u2013 is a requirement for anyone to learn anything well.\nHe does add as well that the kind of practice we put in is important.\u00a0 Those who progress fastest and furthest seem to continually target their weaknesses while maintaining their strengths and finding the most effective strategies for learning.\nAnd finally he adds that natural talent does exist \u2013 that is, some people are born with a special talent for a certain skill.\u00a0 Bach was a world class musician because he put in the time, but also because he did have some natural talent beyond what most of us have.\u00a0 In language learning too, some may have a natural talent that makes learning a language seem easy.\u00a0 But Marcus\u2019 point in this is to point out that none of us is born with an inability to learn and develop a certain skill.\u00a0 Everyone is born with the ability to learn another language \u2013 in that sense we are all the same.\u00a0 Some few just have a little extra in the language learning department.\u00a0 But as adults, we also have cognitive abilities to figure things out that kids don\u2019t have yet.\nGuitar Zero Words of Advice\nAs I listened to Gary tell the stories of his journey and share the research, he also came to the point of sharing a few words of advice with those who called in and to the general audience as well.\u00a0 His advice was focused at adults wanting to get started learning to play music, but it seems good advice as well for language learners.\u00a0 A few specific words of advice were:\nDon\u2019t expect overnight success.\nTarget your weaknesses.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to switch teachers if it\u2019s not working for you.\nFocus on good technique.\nI look forward to reading the book in the next few weeks and hope to pull more lessons for everyday language learners from its contents. For now, I\u2019ll leave you with the above and hope that there is some encouragement to be found in knowing that we adults have all the necessary ability to learn another language and to learn it well.\nIf any of you have read Guitar Zero, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and other lessons that we as language learners can learn from it.\n"}, {"score": 1290.2562, "uuid": "30ee19d5-63c6-5b6e-94a1-c0554eeb8274", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1412wb-45-07398", "target_hostname": "clarionherald.org", "target_uri": "http://clarionherald.org/clarion/index.php/news/catholic-schools/1119-foreign-language-teachers-build-teaching-excellence", "page_rank": 1.1941022e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Foreign</em> <em>language</em> teachers build teaching excellence", "snippet": "Everybody likes the idea of exposing <em>kids</em> to <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em>, but most of the <em>kids</em> only come to us once <em>a</em> week \u2013 it\u2019s not continuous teaching on <em>a</em> daily basis that most of the subjects are.\u201d", "explanation": null, "document": "Foreign language teachers build teaching excellence\nPublished on Wednesday, 11 April 2012 12:35 |\nWritten by Beth Donze |\nAthletic contests and plays aren\u2019t the only events that can fill a Catholic elementary school gym on a Saturday night.\nOn March 31, more than 500 spectators gathered at Rita School in Harahan as 140 students from eight Jefferson Parish Catholic elementary schools performed dances, songs \u2013 and even a fashion show \u2013 to salute their schools\u2019 foreign language programs. The 18 performances were done in Spanish, except for three presentations in French by St. Ann, which exposes its students to both languages.\nDubbed \u201cCatholic Schools Unite in Languages,\u201d the fast-paced extravaganza of colorfully costumed students began with the recitation of the \u201cHail Mary\u201d in Spanish and \u201cThe Pledge of Allegiance\u201d in French.\n\u201cParents love to see their children doing things in the foreign language they are studying,\u201d noted Martha Arostegui, St. Philip Neri\u2019s Spanish teacher of 13 years. \u201cWe were thinking, \u2018How can we show or let people know what we do in a fun way?\u2019\u201d\nSupport group of instructors\nThe idea for the evening of song and dance came out of bi-monthly social gatherings of foreign language faculty from the participating schools. Since 2007, the eight-member group has met at coffee shops, restaurants and on their own campuses to share curricular enhancements and to troubleshoot problems they encounter as foreign language teachers.\nThe informal gatherings, which are usually held on a Saturday morning, also provide valuable social time in which the teachers can unwind with their peers.\n\u201cWe thought it would be a good idea to meet and exchange ideas every once in a while; that way, we could help each other,\u201d said Arostegui said, whose own elaborate Spanish language festival at St. Philip Neri spawned the larger, multiple school event.\nTeaching strategies shared\nConnie Heirsch, the Spanish teacher at St. Rita and Our Lady of Divine Providence, said foreign language teachers face unique obstacles at Catholic elementary schools. For example, the wide majority does not have their own classroom, and are compelled to float across campus to teach the various grade levels.\n\u201cWhat makes us a little different is that we\u2019re alone on campus \u2013 we\u2019re not a (grade-level) teacher, where there are two or more teachers who can collaborate together; we are the department,\u201d Heirsch said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a learning experience for me learning from some of these teachers who have been teaching longer than I have,\u201d Heirsch adds, noting that she and her peers are always on the lookout for new ways to incorporate games into their lessons. For example, spelling and vocabulary games already in use in students\u2019 language arts classes \u2013 such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman and Sparkle \u2013 can easily be adapted from English to Spanish.\n\u201cBecause all of us are the single (foreign language) teacher in each school where we teach, we do a lot of repetition of material,\u201d Heirsch said. \u201cI like to use a lot of games to break up the lesson. They need change in how they\u2019re learning, and it\u2019s a good way to review vocabulary.\u201d\nHeirsch shared with the group of teachers a lesson plan suggested to her by a Spanish teacher in the public school system: challenging older students to write and narrate the Spanish text for a make-believe fashion show.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful teaching tool because the students have to know their color and clothing vocabulary, but they also have to be able to conjugate verbs in Spanish,\u201d Heirsch said. \u201cYou\u2019re limited in what you can do at the elementary school level in terms of writing (in the foreign language),\u201d she said. \u201cSo doing an exercise like this makes it easier when they get to high school.\u201d\nLearning through music\nArostegui, a native of Peru, said the teachers\u2019 diverse backgrounds \u2013 with ties to Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Puerto Rico \u2013 has also been a boon to classroom instruction. On visits to their native countries, the teachers look for Spanish-language DVDs and CDs at bookstores and educational supply outlets and then share them with their colleagues at the various schools. These items are \u201cvery difficult\u201d to find locally, Arostegui notes.\n\u201cMy approach to teaching is different from some of the others. I\u2019m not a (teach-exclusively-from-the) book person,\u201d Arostegui said.\n\u201cMusic is something that I use a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot we can teach through music and games. They can learn and have fun at the same time. Everybody likes the idea of exposing kids to a foreign language, but most of the kids only come to us once a week \u2013 it\u2019s not continuous teaching on a daily basis that most of the subjects are.\u201d\nWhile some foreign language materials areavailable on local shelves, the majority is designed for the high school level and above, she said. Elementary foreign language teachers have the added burden of having to provide materials for an age group that typically spans pre-kindergarten through seventh grade.\nHeirsch said she and her colleagues often turn to online sources for lesson ideas and to software programs, such as PowerPoint.\n\u201cYou can put anything in a text box and create your own lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cI can also record on PowerPoint. I can put a picture on my vocabulary slide and pronounce (the word) for them, so wherever they are, they can study without me being there.\u201d\nDespite the many challenges, Arostegui said exposing youngsters to a foreign language is the source of great personal and professional satisfaction.\n\u201cThe biggest reward is seeing the kids trying to use the language, and feeling good about it, and understanding a word here and there,\u201d Arostegui said. \u201cWhen they go to Epcot, they\u2019ll say, \u2018We went to Mexico and we were able to understand some of the Spanish words,\u2019 or they were able to order at a restaurant.

Used by permission.\nChapter 1. Introduction\nLanguages are big. They are complicated too. But brains are good at learning them, provided they are given the chance. A child learning a second language is often given the chance for his or her brain to do what it needs to do. The brain of an adult often gets less than it needs, because the world of adults is different from the world of children. In addition, adults are commonly under time pressure, and have a psychological need to observe clear and steady progress.\nIt is often said that children learn languages from their environment. They get into an environment where language learning can happen, and language learning happens. What I have to say here is about creating an environment where language learning can start happening for an adult. These are suggestions for beginners, ideally, for people who are just about to begin learning a new language. I'm especially concerned to help people who have to, or wish to, learn a language on their own, in the location where it is spoken, without the advantages and disadvantages of a formal language course. The techniques I will suggest will be especially helpful during the first two months of language learning. Eventually, other approaches will be needed. Even if you start out employing the techniques I suggest, you may end up modifying them, or inventing new techniques of your own. Think of this as one way to learn a lot of language in a short time.\n1.1 What is a beginning language learner trying to do?\nIf we ignore a whole bunch of problems, we can say that a language learner faces two main problems. The first is to get started. The second is to keep from stopping. We are focusing here on the first of these problems. You may intend to become an outstanding speaker of your new language one day. Your first problem is to become any kind of speaker, period. First you must go from being a total non-speaker to being a struggling speaker. Then you can go from being a struggling speaker to being a comfortable speaker. Way down the road, if things work out, you may come to speak the new language almost as easily as you speak your mother tongue. Right now, you'd be happy with a lot less than that. When you can basically get along in the language, given enough effort on your part and enough cooperation on the part of the person who you are talking to, you will be a \"basic speaker\" of your new language.\nYou are entitled to call yourself a basic speaker of the new language when you meet two conditions. First, your ability to understand the language (commonly referred to as comprehension ability) is adequate so that a typical speaker of the language can always get her point across to you, given a bit of effort, and provided the topic is fairly mundane. Second, your ability to speak the language is such that you can always get your point across to other people, given a bit of cooperation, and provided the topic is mundane.\nGet the picture? You and a typical speaker of the language work together cooperatively to make communication successful. It is hard work for both of you, but you usually succeed. A mundane topic is any topic involving ordinary concrete experience, but not including things like philosophy, theology, and punctuated equilibria. The cooperative effort between a fluent speaker and a new speaker is called the negotiation of meaning. A lot of the burden falls on the fluent speaker to make this communication successful. The fluent speaker must simplify her speech, and speak slowly and clearly, and help you to find the words you are groping for. Both of you often will need to guess at what the other is saying, or meaning to say.\nWe now have an idea of your first target: to be a basic speaker, able to negotiate meaning with a cooperative conversational partner. So that's what I want to help you do--to go from being unable to speak this language at all to being able to negotiate meaning with a cooperative native speaker.\nAnd when I say speak, I really do mean speak. A tape recorder can't speak. Neither can a parrot, in the sense I have in mind. By \"speak a language\", I mean that you can start with an idea that you want to get across, and go on to express that idea in words that someone else can understand. In addition, you will often understand what they say in response, or at least the gist of it, and if you don't understand, you can work with them conversationally until you get the point they are trying to make.\nYou may have had experiences attempting to learn other languages. Those experiences may have been successful or unsuccessful. Whether or not you have had experiences learning other languages, you will have beliefs about language learning. What is it to know a language? What is it to speak a language? How do people learn languages? Is learning a language like learning a poem, like learning chemistry, like learning to play the piano, like all of these, like none of these? How is it normally accomplished (in cases where it really is accomplished, as opposed to only attempted)? Take a few minutes (or hours, as the case may be) to jot down your beliefs about language learning.\nDO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT JOTTING DOWN YOUR BELIEFS!\nDone? Good. Here are some of my beliefs. I believe that I must work at learning to understand a language just as much as I must work at learning to talk in it. At one time, I believed that if I learned to talk, I would automatically be able to understand. Today, I believe that I must also learn to understand. Another belief I have is that I will only become familiar with a language if I have extensive exposure to it. But I believe that for that exposure to do any good I must be able to understand at least some of what I am hearing. Another thing I believe is that when I am first learning a language, both understanding it and speaking it will be hard work. I expect to speak the language poorly at first, and then, as I keep using the language with people, both in talking and in listening, I believe that my ability will gradually improve. That is, I will go from speaking the language brokenly to speaking it fluently. Another important belief I hold is that I am far more likely to be successful if I can devote myself full time to learning the language, than if I have another full-time job and attempt to do language learning on the side. Learning a language is tiring, so \"full-time\" might mean five or six hours per day. Or it might mean eight hours. But I believe that I am less likely to be successful if I try to learn a language as a side-line, than if I see language learning as my central responsibility. During my six or eight hours per day of language learning, I believe that I need to devote most of the time to actual communication and conversation. But I also believe that unstructured, real-life conversation is not enough for me. I need to engage in structured communication activities which will help me to learn the language. These structured communication activities are especially important during the early weeks of language learning. Without structured language learning activities, I may not succeed, and even if I do succeed, my progress will be slower, and my ultimate achievement lower, than might have been the case.\nHow do your beliefs compare to mine? Probably, you thought of things which I did not think of, and I reminded you of things you did not think of. That illustrates an important principle. If you want to have a positive experience learning a language, get together often with friends who are also trying to learn a language, and share ideas with them. They may be learning the same language as you, or they may be learning different languages. If it is the same language, you can share discoveries related to that language. In any case, you can share discoveries related to what helps you as language learners. You can also share your woes. You can laugh together and cry together. Hmm. Guess that's another belief of mine that I forgot to mention in the preceding paragr. I hate lonely language learning. I believe that I need encouragement from people who have some idea of what I am up against.\n1.2 Learning about the language versus learning the language\nOne common belief about language learning is that to learn a language is to learn a body of facts. In Chemistry class you learn facts such as a carbon atom can form four bonds with other atoms. In German class you learned facts such as the first person singular present tense form of mchten is mchte and facts such as the word meaning \"dog\" is hund. Learning a language is seen as learning hundreds or thousands of facts about grammar and vocabulary.\nAnother common belief is that to learn a language is to form a set of habits. A common comparison is to riding a bicycle. When you first try to ride a bicycle, or type, or play the piano, you struggle to do it at all. But with practice it becomes an automatic habit.\nNo doubt there is truth in both of these beliefs. However, there is also little doubt that these are gross over-simplifications. Any kind of learning, whether it is like learning chemistry or like learning to play the piano, is incredibly complex. But learning a language is uniquely complex. Fortunately, you didn't have to understand how your muscles worked, or even what exactly they were doing, in order to learn to ride a bike. It is even more fortunate that your brain will deal with most of the complexity of learning a language without you (or anyone) understanding how it does it. Otherwise it would be a rather hopeless situation.\nBut you need to set your brain to work. I'm not talking about learning facts about language, much as that may help some people. I'm talking about your brain actually using language as language. In the final analysis, that is the only thing that will get your brain to acquire the language. There are two main ways you use your language ability. You use it to express your own ideas, and you use it to understand other people's ideas. When you are just starting to acquire your new language, that is, when you're are at the absolute point zero, it is impossible to use it to express your own ideas in it. But it is possible even at that point to begin understanding someone else's ideas in it, especially when those ideas are centered around that other person's desire to help you start learning the language. You can start understanding the language before you know how to talk in the language.\nAlternatively, some people like to begin by memorizing sentences in the new language. That's O.K. too, but when you memorize a sentence, it doesn't involve you in using language as language. Remember that to use language as language means to put your own ideas into words or to understand other people's ideas from their words. You may learn to say \"Where is the bathroom?\", and whenever you need to know where the bathroom is, you pull that sentence out of your hat. And you may also be able to use it as a master pattern for asking where other things are. You want to know where the kitchen is, and you know the word for \"kitchen\", and you think to yourself, \"Now let's see, to say 'Where is the bathroom?' I say 'XYZ', where Z means bathroom; and let's see, mm, W means kitchen, so if I want to say 'Where is the kitchen?', I'll just substitute W for Z and say 'XYW'.\" So then you say \"XYW?\", and the person you said it to tells you where the kitchen is. Your thought process might not be quite as laborious as that, but do you get the idea? That is one way a lot of people start out learning a language, and many of them end up being successful. However, it takes most people a long time to memorize what amounts to a tiny taste of the language they are learning.\nFortunately, it is also possible to start out from the outset learning the language in ways that are more language-like. In this case, you will get someone to talk to you in the language as your initial means of learning the language. Suppose you want to learn to ask where the bathroom is, and where other rooms are. You might draw a simple floor plan of your house. Your friend, who is your Language Resource Person (LRP), will point to the different rooms in the floor plan, and tell you (in her language), \"This is the kitchen; this is the bathroom; this is the entry way\". Since she points at each part of the house as she tells you what it is called, you can understand what she is saying, even if you have never heard these words before. You are already processing the language as language in your own brain. That is a central concept in all that follows. You learn the language by processing the language as language.\n1.3 You can learn the language in the language before you know the language: an example\nLet's use this example of learning the names of rooms in the house to illustrate some key principles involved in learning the language through using the language. You probably wouldn't start out with this in your real language learning situation, but it is something you could do during your first month for sure. The principles illustrated will apply from your very first day of language learning--if you apply them, that is.\nSo back to the sketch of the floor plan of your house. If your LRP starts off just racing along saying \"This is the kitchen; this is the bathroom; this is the entry way; this is the door; this is the sitting room; this is the sink; this is the toilet; this is the bedroom; this is the bed; this is the dresser; this is the dining room; this is the table; this is the \", you will be overwhelmed with the flood of language, and you won't be processing very much of it at all. On the other hand, if she says \"This is the kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen,\" that will get pretty boring, and pretty soon you won't be processing the language. You need an approach that will\n1. make it possible for you to process what you hear.\n2. force you to process what you hear.\n3. keep you interested in processing what you hear, and\n4. keep you learning more and more of the language as you go along.\nHere is a good way to do this. Your LRP begins with just the kitchen and the bathroom. She says \"This is the kitchen and this is the bathroom\" (pointing to where they are in the floor plan as she speaks). She says that a few times. Then she questions you: \"Where is the bathroom? Where is the kitchen?\" You respond by pointing appropriately. Do you see why you need to start with two items? If she just told you \"This is the kitchen\", and then said \"Where is the kitchen?\", there would be only one possible answer. That is, there would be no choice. If there is no choice, there is no need to process. You could just point at the bathroom without even listening to her. Having two choices to start with will force you to process what you hear. On the other hand, if you start out with more than two items, there will be too much to remember. You may be surprised to find that starting out with \"This is the bathroom; this is the kitchen; this is the entry way,\" is enough to overload your mental processor. You may manage three items O.K., but not many more than that. So by starting out with not more than two or three items to choose between, you make it possible to process what you hear. Now you just have to worry about keeping yourself interested in processing what you hear, as well as keeping yourself learning more and more of the language as you go along.\nNow suppose your LRP tells you \"This is the bathroom; this is the kitchen,\" and repeats that several times and then says \"Where is the bathroom? Where is the kitchen?\" a few times, and you point at the bathroom and the kitchen correctly. Then she says \"This is the bathroom; this is the kitchen; this is the entry way\" a few times, and asks you \"Where is the bathroom? Where is the kitchen? Where is the entry-way?\" She then adds a fourth item in a similar manner. I can predict that you'll soon be pointing correctly withobothering to process what she is saying. Can you see why? If she asks you the questions in the same order that she told you the names of the rooms, and keeps asking you over and over in the same order, then all you have to do is remember the order: bathroom, kitchen, entry way ... So if you are going to be forced to process the language as language, it is necessary that your LRP ask you the questions in random order. That way you won't know for sure what she is going to ask. You will have to listen to what she says to you and process it in order to understand. This involves what has been called the principle of uncertainty reduction. You are uncertain what she wants you to point at until you have used what she said as a means of determining what she wants you to point at. This is real communication. Here you have just begun, and you are already using the language for real communication! You are learning the language by processing the language.\nSo we started with just two items, the kitchen and the bathroom. You want to get to the place where your LRP can ask you to point to different parts of the house and items of furniture, and you can point correctly. Once again, it is essential that you not overwhelm your mental processor. You avoid overloading your mental processor by\n1. introducing new items one at a time,\n2. having the new item repeated along with several familiar ones many times, and\n3. having the new items questioned (\"Where is the X?\", or \"Point to the X\", or \"Show me the X\", etc.) many times, but always randomly, along with questions about other items (otherwise no processing will occur).\nNow as you are going along, you may be on your tenth item, which is, let's say, the verandah. Your LRP says, \"This is the verandah\". In order to keep your mental processor processing, she says this several times but always randomly interspersed among other items you have already learned: \"This is the verandah; this is the sitting room; this is the verandah; this is the front yard; this is the backyard; this is the verandah; this is the kitchen; this is the verandah; this is the door.\" I have yet to see an LRP who appreciates the amount of repetition I need in order to learn new items. At this point I may want to hear verandah twenty or thirty times, interspersed among familiar items as illustrated. The LRP may think that five repetitions is plenty. Fortunately, most LRP s will soon come to accept the need for repetition, as long as you keep gently reminding them.\nNow imagine that you are working on your fifteenth item, say the kitchen sink, and your LRP is asking you \"Where is the kitchen sink?\" randomly interspersed among questions such as \"Where is the bathroom?\", \"Where is the kitchen\", etc. Frequently, you will discover that you can no longer remember an item which you knew a few minutes earlier. Suppose while the LRP is working with you on \"Where is the bathroom?\", she asks you \"Where is the sitting room?\" A few minutes earlier, it appeared that you had learned sitting room. Now you find that when she says the word for sitting room, you cannot remember what it means. What your LRP does at such points is to act as though you now need to learn sitting room, and she asks you the question \"Where is the sitting room?\" many times, always interspersed randomly among other questions. Once you are again able to consistently recognize sitting room, she will emphasize kitchen sink a few more times, since that is the new item you were working on. If you aren't having any problem with kitchen sink, the LRP goes on to item sixteen, perhaps, stove.\nAt times you may have special difficulty with two items which strike you as similar in pronunciation. This happened for me in Urdu with kira which means 'cucumber', and kela, which means 'banana', since we were learning the word for cucumber and the word for banana in the same session (using real cucumbers and bananas, along with other pieces of fruit and vegetables). These two words may not look all that similar to you, but I have seen learners become confused over choices involving words that were considerably less similar than these. When this happens, you should have the LRP focus on the two items which you are confusing. At first she can just concentrate on those two items: \"Pick up a banana; pick up a cucumber; pick up a cucumber; pick up a banana; pick up a cucumber; pick up a banana; pick up a banana; pick up a banana; pick up a cucumber...\". She should then add one or two items that you already know well, along with cucumber and banana. Then add one or two more familiar items. Gradually, she'll get back to using all of the items you have learned so far during the current activity.\nNow suppose you had never heard this language before the session with the floor plan. You've been processing the language as language, and doing so for, say, one hour. Your session ends. You have to go to the airport to pick up a friend who is just arriving from your home country. Your friend tells you, \"I need to visit the restroom\". You say to the security guard, in your new language, \"Where is the bathroom?\" You've never said that before. In your session you only learned to comprehend it and didn't try to say it. But you now needed it, and it came out, and it felt like natural communication. That is, you had an idea that you needed to express, and you expressed it. Your visiting friend is impressed. The security guard points to the bathroom and says something which you don't understand. You don't realize that you used a word that only means \"bathroom\" in a home, and a different word is used for the airport restroom. But it just doesn't matter at all at this point. The security guard knew what you meant and knew that you were doing your best. After all, you've only been learning the language for an hour. I'd say you're doing pretty well.\nNow alternatively, you might have learned to say \"Where is the bathroom?\" without processing the language as language in the way I described. For example, you might have taken a 3x5 card and written on one side of it \"Where is the bathroom?\" in English, and written on the other side of it \"Where is the bathroom?\" in the new language. Then you could have tested yourself on that over and over, and repeated the sentence to yourself hundreds of times until you had it memorized. You still could have said it to the security guard.\nThe way you learned it was quite different. You learned it by being asked where the bathroom was (on your little floor plan). When you were asked, you had to determine what you were being asked. That is, you actually had to understand the new language. Then you indicated where the bathroom was, conveying to a speaker of the language the fact that you had understood what she asked.\nIn the early days of language learning, many people, perhaps most people, are able to learn much more quickly if they learn the language by processing the language than they can learn by memorizing expressions from on 3x5 cards, or from tape recordings. More importantly, they will be giving their brain the chance to start developing genuine comprehension ability. You start out small, and by using appropriate techniques, you steadily and rapidly expand your comprehension ability. You'll be amazed at how much you will be able to comprehend by the end of a month. It will be considerably more than you could have memorized in the same month. If you choose rather to learn primarily by memorizing sentences, it will do very little for your comprehension ability. You only learn to comprehend by comprehending, and you learn to talk by using the language to formulate and utter sentences which put your own ideas into words as the need arises. You can create situations in your language sessions in which needs arise. You can also plan your language sessions so that they relate to the communication needs that you are facing in real life settings.\nAs I say, the approach I am suggesting is not the only approach. You may well succeed by memorizing a lot of sentences and using them as patterns for constructing new sentences. As you do this, it will cause people to talk to you in the new language, and someyou will understand some of what they say and thus have the chance to process language as language and thereby start developing your comprehension ability. But I believe you'll be off to a much slower start than if you use your times with your LRP to do heavy-duty, large scale language processing.\nChapter 2. Getting started with your Language Resource Person\nNow you have some idea of what I mean when I speak of learning the language by using the language as language. Let's get to it. You need a language resource person. That is the same as saying that you can only learn to communicate if you have someone to communicate with. Often, the best way to find the person or people you need is to go through people whom you already know. If you don't know anyone, you may need to just start asking around. It is better if you do not make a long term arrangement with anyone to help you in this way at the outset. If you make a long term arrangement, and then the person turns out to be unsatisfactory, you have a problem. If several people help you once or twice, not expecting to do more, and out of them one or two become regular helpers, no one's feelings are likely to be hurt, especially if you continue your friendship with all of the people who initially helped you.\nIt may be good to make it clear that you do not want someone to \"teach you the language\". Otherwise, they may send you to an esteemed expert on the \"high\" language. You may have difficulty learning mundane everyday language from such a person. In addition, such a person may have very strong ideas about how languages are learned, and those may not be the most helpful ideas. You might tell people that first you need to learn the common language, and then when you can speak the common language you will go to that person to learn about the high language.\nAs people help you during your early struggles with their language, you need to be sure that it isn't a one-sided arrangement, where you get a lot out of it, and those who help you get little out of it. Realize that if people exert themselves for you, you owe them something. Fortunately, many fruitful language learning activities can go on in the context of friendship and social visiting. To the extent that you need a regular, scheduled format with an LRP, you need to take care that your helper is adequately rewarded.\nWhen you are seeking people to help you, you are likely to find that some people automatically light up at the idea. If this doesn't happen, you may need to do some careful relationship building first. Start with people you know, and become friends with their close friends and relatives, and then in turn with those people's close friends and relatives. Spend time with people. As people are people together they tend to do things for each other, and soon there is a sense of mutual obligation. Get it? Mutual! At that point you should be able to get someone to at least give an hour to serving as an LRP. You might do that with a few people. Hopefully, someone will enjoy it enough to want to do it often. If you end up arranging a regular schedule, you should consider paying a fixed amount. If you don't pay a fixed amount, then try to make sure that the benefits to the LRP cost you at least as much as you would pay if you did pay a fixed amount. In many parts of the world, the going hourly wage may be low by your standards, but it is best to stay close to it. In other parts of the world you may pay five or ten dollars an hour. In that case, you'll surely want to have a powerful strategy for using the time to the full, and come to your language learning sessions well prepared, and tape-record all that you do in the sessions, and make extensive use of those tape-recordings following the sessions.\nFor further thoughts on the language learner's approach to relationship building, see Thomson (1993c) .\n2.1. Your very first language session\nO.K., you now have your language resource person (LRP) with you sitting at the table in your kitchen. What do you do now? Well, you could draw that floor plan of your house. But we had better reflect for a moment. As a matter of fact, you never start a language session without considerable prior reflection and planning. It should occur to you that the first thing you need to do is to put your LRP through the ropes. As I talk about your first session, in which you are putting your LRP through the ropes, I'll probably keep getting side-tracked by the ropes, if you don't mind.\n2.1.1. TPR -Total (and minimal) Physical Response\nThe method I described in connection with the floor plan of your house falls into a broad category of activities which are called Total Physical Response (Asher 1982; Silvers 1985 ). In the case of the floor plan, the physical response was merely to point at the bathroom when the LRP said \"Where is the bathroom?\" There was nothing very \" total\" about that response. But people still call it TPR. The original idea was that the more you put your whole body into responding, the better you learned. That may make sense. Learning a language means learning to relate patterns of words to aspects of experience. So if the LRP said \"jump\", and you jumped six inches, the \"experience\" side of the equation might be less than if you jumped two feet.\nPersonally, I wouldn't make a big deal of that in general. (As a matter of fact, I would change the meaning of the abbreviation TPR to stand for, \"Tune in, Process, Respond\". That is, as the LRP tells you something, you tune in to what she said, figure out what it means, and demonstrate to her that you understood her by responding appropriately.) However, for training your LRP on the first day, it may be good to do total TPR. In order to help your LRP get the hang of things, you can begin with simple commands that involve a gross physical response (in the best sense of the word gross). These include things like stand up, sit down, walk, run, stop, go back, turn around, clap, talk, be quiet, go to sleep, wake up, eat, drink. In some cases you will mime the activity (as with sleep). In other cases you will perform it literally (as with sit down).\nHere's some homework: Come up with an additional fifty simple instructions you might use for TPR at this point. You need to start learning to prepare for language sessions. So start.\nI SAW THAT. DO YOUR HOMEWORK!\n2.1.2. Back to your first language session\nNow, back to your session. You will have your LRP give you these instructions in the manner described earlier, namely, starting with two instructions, adding one new one at a time, with considerable repetition, always ordering the instructions randomly so that you will be forced to process what you are hearing and decide what to do in response. You might aim to learn ten or twenty instructions your first day. The vocabulary is likely to be basic, essential vocabulary, so the time is well spent from the standpoint of vocabulary learning. But you will also have helped your LRP to get an idea of how you will be learning during the early weeks. You are trying to get a foothold on the language by getting enough basic vocabulary and sentence patterns to function with as a basic speaker. And you are trying to jump start your learning by becoming thoroughly familiar with a lot of basic vocabulary and sentence patterns.\nThis system may be a bit complicated for the LRP initially. One good way to train the LRP is to have a second language learner participate with you. I hate doing language learning by myself, anyway. Besides that, you can have a lot more flexibility in communication if there is at least one other person. I enjoy working with my wife. In that case, we have used the following technique with a new LRP. The LRP and I sit facing each other, and my wife stands or sits behind me so that she is visible to the LRP, but not to me. She does the actions, and that is what prompts the LRP to instruct me to do them. A new LRP is unlikely to give twenty repetitions of the instruction \"stand up\". But my wife knows that I need that much repetition, and so she prompts the LRP accordingly. She takes care of complicated details like starting out with only two instructions,adding new ones gradually, keeping them in random order, and so on. Whatever she does, the LRP instructs me to do. Eventually the LRP gets the idea. Whenever you use a new variety of TPR you can train your LRP in this manner.\nYou or the LRP should also keep a written record (either in words or simple drawings) of what you have covered. Otherwise she may forget to keep going back to earlier items while introducing later ones.\nAt first, the LRP may find the whole business of TPR bizarre. If she is someone who has \"tutored\" other language learners, she will soon be surprised at your rate of progress compared to others she has helped, and that is likely to encourage her to press on playing games with you. In addition, she is likely to find such language learning sessions fun and interesting, as opposed to dull and boring.\nYou yourself may have trouble with such activities, feeling that you are being silly or foolish. It may be that some people will simply be unable to get past this, and will prefer to learn a language by memorizing sentences and so on. But why don't you give it a try. You may not believe that you can be developing real communication skills through what seems like game-playing. But one expert on how children learn their first language, Jerome Bruner, has observed that game-playing can play a central role in that process (Bruner 1983). Games are fun. Playing games involves less stress than behaving proficiently for real-life purposes. And you really can develop a lot of comprehension ability through game-like activities. In a month or so you can learn to recognize many hundreds of common vocabulary and understand many types of sentences. You can start developing genuine speaking ability, as well. You will then be in a strong position to rapidly become proficient in using the language in a wide variety of real life situations.\n2.1.3. TPR with lots of junk (Object Manipulation)\nYou need to do more than simple TPR. Despite the fun-and-games nature of TPR in its classical form, it will probably get boring for your LRP if that is all you do. Besides that, there may be limits to how much you can learn this way. Strong proponents argue that every grammatical construction can somehow be embedded in TPR instructions. This is more likely if you broaden your range of activities to include some in which the physical response is less than total. As I say, people still refer to such activities as TPR.\nOne easy twist to add is to use lots of physical objects in connection with TPR activities. You can find a large number of common objects around the house, or in the market. And many objects will suggest actions. What actions can be performed with a piece of cloth? A piece of paper? A piece of rope? Get it? Manipulating objects in compliance with the LRP's instructions falls within the broad category of TPR activities. I will also refer to this simply as object manipulation.\n2.1.4. TPR as role-play\nAnother twist is to base a TPR activity on some real life communication situation. For example, you can lay out a number of sheets of paper or envelopes in a format such as the following:\n[picture of paper arranged as city blocks]\nPretend the papers are city blocks, and the spaces between them are streets. You hold a small toy car in your hand, and pretend that it is a taxi, and you are the driver. Your LRP gives you instructions such as \"Drive three blocks and turn right\", and you comply by moving the toy car appropriately. This is a simple variety of role-play. By combining TPR with role-play, you can learn to understand expressions that you will need to use in real life communication situations. When you get into those situations you will be surprised how many of the expressions will come to you naturally, and you will use them in speech, even though you did not memorize them by rote. You learned them by hearing them repeatedly and each time processing what you heard and responding to it.\n2.1.5. Pictures - the language learner's gold mine\nAnother twist can further extend the potential of TPR. Use pictures, either photos, or line drawings (or even video recordings) as the basis for communication. In the long run, pictures have far more potential than simple actions. Pictures make it possible to learn to talk about the whole range of daily activities and experiences. You can repeatedly use the same pictures to learn to understand sentences of a variety of patterns. Suppose that during your eighth language session you are focusing on learning to understood sentences which describe an ongoing process in past time. Each sentence begins, \"When this picture was taken...\" and goes on to say what was happening when the picture was taken. \"When this picture was taken, this man was ploughing. When this picture was taken, this woman was making bread. When this picture was taken, this man was fixing a chair.\" Etc. The LRP makes up these sentences on the fly. You have to process what you hear, and respond by indicating which picture she is describing. There are a hundred pictures (though only a few are in view at any given moment). The verbs themselves (ploughing, making, fixing, etc.) are not new to you, since you have been through these same pictures with the LRP many times. What is new is the form of the verbs used to describe an ongoing process in past time. By the time you get through the hundred pictures, you will have processed and responded to a hundred sentences which describe a past ongoing process. You'll be surprised how familiar you will have become with that sentence pattern.\nWhile listening to a hundred sentences in a given form (and responding by pointing to the picture being described), you may get lazy, and not attend to the form of the sentence, but only catch one or two key words which are enough to allow you to respond. It may therefore be good to go through the pictures again, allowing the LRP to use two contrasting patterns. For example, she might use a pattern that begins \"After this picture was taken-- \" along with the pattern beginning \"When this picture was taken--\". Using two or three contrasting patterns will increase the chances that you thoroughly attend to and process what you hear.\nThere are many sources for pictures. You can clip them from local magazines, travel brochures or old National Geographic articles related to your host country or to neighboring countries. It is far better if you can take your own photos of local scenes. It may be that your LRP can help with this. On one occasion in Pakistan, my wife and I were able to take over a hundred photos (three rolls of film), capturing a wide variety of common daily activities, in the space of about two hours. It actually took longer to arrange the pictures into a good sequence and pasting them in the book took several hours!\nFor the early stages of language learning I recommend pictures with certain characteristics. Each picture has one or more people in it who are the central characters. In addition there are one or more inanimate objects which the person is using or doing something to. For example, the person may be using a hammer to build a table. Thus, in addition to the person, there is both a hammer and a table. Another person might be riding a bicycle. Another might be standing at a cash till. Two people might be simply sitting on a bench. The objects the people are involved with need not always be inanimate. Someone might be feeding an animal or nursing a baby. And it is not necessary that every single picture meet these criteria, but it is good if many of them do. I would consider having two or three identical sets of the pictures developed. Then I could glue one set in a notebook and have one or two sets loose. For different activities you might find it preferable to either use the pictures in a notebook or loose. Or you might want your co-learner and yourself to have the same pictures. For example, your co-learner might show a picture to the LRP from her set. The LRP then tells you something about the picture, and you respond by pointing to the same picture in your own set. Loose pictures can be manipulated and sorted. There are also advantages to the consistencof order and arrangement which a picture book provides.\nA variety of commercial resources are also available. Harris Winitz has prepared a number of books of drawings for language learners aimed at highlighting specific vocabulary and sentence patterns. This series, Language Through Pictures, is available from the International Linguistics Corporation, 401 89th Street, Kansas City, MO, 64114. Both Longman and Oxford University Press publish books of pictures for language learners, grouped according to topics or settings, which they misleadingly call dictionaries. These are The Longman Photo Dictionary and The New Oxford Picture Dictionary. They are available in a number of major languages, but can easily be adapted to other languages, although they are based around Euro-American themes and settings for the most part. A variety of visual aids for language learners are available from Sky Oaks Productions, Box 1102, Los Gatos, California 95031.\nFinally, at any point you can resort to drawing sketches, stick figures, or diagrams to use in a given language learning activity. I suspect that having the actual objects in hand is better than using sketches of them, but sketches are a whole lot better than merely using your mind's eye, since sketches still allow you to respond to what you process by pointing or by manipulating them. Without such aids it is hard to be sure you process what you hear. More importantly, these external aids are often what enables you to understand the language in the first place, so that you have a chance to process what you hear. If you can't process what you hear, it is of little use to you.\nI will have many suggestions below regarding using pictures to highlight specific sentence patterns. A wide variety of sentence patterns can be highlighted by having the LRP take a pattern and use that pattern to make a comment about each picture in succession. In that way you will quickly hear and comprehend a hundred examples (if you have a hundred pictures) of a single sentence pattern. In addition to the examples I will give below in connection with specific sentence patterns, I have given a concise overview of this approach in Thomson (1989) . I suggest a slightly different approach in Thomson (1992). Both approaches assume the pictures you use are pasted in a book, and that you make repeated passes through the book with the LRP telling you things about the pictures on each pass. The two approaches differ mainly in the third pass through the book. On the first pass through the book the LRP teaches the words for human beings (man, woman, boy, girl, etc.). On the second pass the LRP teaches the words for the inanimate objects which the people are using or acting upon. On the third pass, in the first approach, the LRP uses a single verb repeatedly in describing every picture. The verb might be holding. The descriptions would then go, \"This man is holding a hammer. This woman is holding a spatula. This child is holding a toy. (Etc.)\" for perhaps a hundred pictures. (It may be necessary to use two or three verbs in some cases.) The point is to have the experience of comprehending a lot of sentences which contain subjects and objects (such as child and toy, respectively). The approach suggested in Thomson (1992) is a little less artificial. After talking about the humans on the first pass through the book and talking about the most salient objects on the second pass, the LRP simply makes what she feels is the most natural descriptive statement of what each person is doing on the third pass. Often, the learner will not understand what the LRP says on this pass, but the learner and LRP tape-record it all, and go over the tape together, discussing whatever the learner did not understand. I fluctuate as to which of these two approaches I prefer.\n2.1.6. Back to your first session again\nNow, back to your first session with your LRP. In order to keep your session interesting, you might include three different types of activities. You can begin with classic TPR using simple actions (\"stand up,\" \"jump,\" etc.). Then for your second activity, why don't you learn the names of a whole bunch of common objects that are present in the setting where you'll be having your language sessions. You can respond to questions like \"Where is the churn?\" by pointing to the churn, or whatever. Why not go for another ten or twenty vocabulary in this manner during the session. Then you can do something with pictures.\nDuring this first session, the LRP can get the basic idea of describing pictures for you. If I were the language learner, I would start with the set of pictures that are glued in a notebook, rather than with a loose set. I will have arranged them in the notebook in such a way that the first few pictures have a man as the central character, and the next few have a woman, and then in subsequent pictures men and women are randomly interspersed. Then children are added, and then perhaps youths, and old people.\nNow, my LRP would begin telling me which type of person is in each picture. \"This is a man. This is a man. This is a man. This is a woman. This is a woman. This is a man and a woman. This is a woman. This is a man. This is a boy. This is a boy and a woman and a man. This is another boy. This is a boy, too. This is a girl. This is a girl and a boy. This is a girl and a woman and a man. These are some boys. These are some girls. This is an old man. These are some children and some women. This is an old woman...\"\nThese first picture descriptions may sound pretty simple minded, but I encourage you to start out this way. Language learners find it gives them a real sense of hearing and understanding the language right off the bat. You realize that you are genuinely learning the language from day one. It also gives the LRP a clear sense of communicating with you in the language, which helps to overcome preconceptions she may have about how languages should be taught.\n2.1.7. For those who want to start talking in the first session\nYour major focus during the early days of language learning should be on learning to understand the language. Of course, learning to say things like hello and good-bye at the very outset is unavoidable. But some language learners tell me that as soon as they start learning to understand the language by means of TPR, picture descriptions, etc, they simply must start attempting to say all those things that they are learning to understand. For some learners, this may well be true. In other cases, language learners simply cannot imagine learning to comprehend without attempting to speak, because they have never given it a try. In any case, the issue is controversial, with worthy supporters on both sides. I am a strong believer in what is called delayed oral production. I believe that most people will learn far more quickly if they concentrate heavily on learning to comprehend during the early days of language learning. But you may not agree. If you prefer to start speaking during your first session, you should still follow the sequence of first learning to understand words and sentences, and then basing your speaking attempts on what you have learned to understand. For example, once you understand the expressions which the LRP has used in describing the pictures, you can say those things yourself, perhaps in reference to new pictures where those expressions make sense. In some of my suggestions I recommend you respond to the LRP by pointing at pictures or objects. You may prefer to respond orally, using words and phrases such as here, there, this one, that one, rather than merely by pointing. In connection with TPR activities, once you understand the TPR instructions, you can start learning to say what it was that you did when you responded to an instruction. For example, if the instruction is \"Take off your glasses\", you can take off your glasses, and then say \"I took off my glasses.\" Or the LRP can perform the actions that you have learned the words for, and you can tell her what she did. But I don't really recommend this during the early period of language learning, and I'll have more to say about the issue shortly.\n2.2. Aftyour language session is over\nNow you have finished your first session. You spent an hour or more preparing for it. The session itself lasted for one or two hours. And you tape-recorded the whole thing. Take a breather. Your work isn't done.\n2.2.1 Using tape-recordings of your sessions\nYou can extend the value of your session considerably by wise use of the tape-recording you made during the session. You did make a tape, didn't you? I find I get very clear tape recordings if I use lapel microphones. I like to use a stereo recorder with two lapel microphones in case I want to record two native speakers interacting, or to record myself and a native speaker interacting. I also like to use a double cassette recorder so that I can copy sample bits of the session onto a second tape. This second tape will grow from day to day, as I add key excerpts of each day's session. I don't need to save all fifty instances when the LRP said \"stand up\" during the session. But during the final part of the initial TPR activity I had learned to respond to fifteen commands, and the LRP was rapidly using all of them (in random order), and I was rapidly responding to all fifteen (or however many) commands. Therefore, by dubbing the final few minutes of TPR instructions onto a new tape, I can save a complete record of the expressions I learned in the initial TPR activity of that session. I will similarly dub excerpts of the second (pointing) activity onto the same tape.\nWith the picture descriptions I may just dub the whole works over onto the abbreviated tape. I can listen to that several times: This is a man, this is a woman, etc. Keeping up with the descriptions and not losing my place is enough of a challenge at this point to force me to keep processing what I am hearing.\nAs I listen to the recording of the TPR activities, I can actually respond, or I may just recall how I responded during the session. I may even listen to the tape of each entire session a few times during the days following the session. I would hope to be adding a new session every day, but it is important to keep cycling through the taped excerpts of previous sessions.\nIn the coming weeks, you will be systematically focusing on a large variety of sentence patterns. You will always learn to understand the sentences during your session. However, you could easily forget much of what you learn, were it not for the fact that you keep cycling through the taped excerpts of your earlier sessions. As you listen to excerpts of an earlier session, you can recall what you were doing in the session as you processed and responded to what you heard. If you have difficulty maintaining concentration while listening to the tape, then you can actually perform the responses (for example, point to the appropriate picture upon hearing a sentence about it), as you listen to the tape.\n2.2.2 Daily record keeping --more than just a frill\nIt is important that you devote some time at the end of each day to record keeping. If the alphabet of the language you are learning is similar to the English alphabet (or some other alphabet you are already comfortable with), and if the spelling is closely tied to the pronunciation, then you can begin using the writing system at once. It may be that there is as yet no writing system for the language, or that the writing system is very different from any you have known before and quite difficult. In that case, you will be better off to postpone learning the writing system for awhile. For the sake of your record keeping, just write things down roughly using English letters and whatever symbols (say, accent marks) you find helpful. I am personally capable of writing things in a technical phonetic alphabet, but during the first days of language learning I don't worry about writing down the fine details. That is because I do not use what I write as a basis for my pronunciation anyway. My pronunciation (when I get around to speaking) will be based on what I have heard, not on what I wrote. The writing is for the purpose of keeping track of what I learned, and providing some visual reinforcement, which I find helpful.\nOne important component of your daily records should be a simple log of the vocabulary you have covered, with a rough English translation for each vocabulary item. This will help you in keeping track of your progress in acquiring vocabulary, and will also assist you as you plan your subsequent sessions, since each session will include some review of previously learned items.\nOne of your goals can be to learn to recognize thirty new vocabulary items every day. That will be 150 per week. Thus after seven weeks you will be able to recognize over a thousand common vocabulary items. If you're more energetic, you can realistically go for fifty new vocabulary items per day, and thus learn a thousand items in a month. The key is to be well prepared, and to keep listening to your tapes and reviewing previously learned items in subsequent sessions.\nYou should also write out any observations you may have as to how the language is put together, or why you think certain forms of words may be used in some cases, and different forms in other cases. You can relate this to your goals for covering a broad range of sentence patterns, a matter which I will discuss at length below. You should also mention anything that puzzles you about how the language works.\nYou will also keep various checklists of ideas for your language sessions. Below I will suggest checklists that you can add to from day to day. You will use them as part of the basis for planning your language sessions. These include a checklist of situations in which you need to use the language, and topics which you need to discuss in the language. You can also have a checklist for special areas of vocabulary that may come to mind. You can go out and look around the community for ideas for vocabulary and examples of daily life situations, and add these to the checklists. I will provide you with many suggestions for vocabulary and sentence patterns to cover. These, too, should be used as checklists.\nAnother important component of your record keeping is a diary in which you describe your whole experience as a language learner each day. This will have various uses. For one thing, reading back over your diary as the weeks and months go by will help you to appreciate the progress you have made. For another thing, the diary will help you to share your experience with a language learning consultant who may help you, or with other language learners, who may also share their diaries with you. The discipline of diary writing will help you to maintain a high level of self-awareness, which is important in the ongoing process of planning and self-evaluation.\n2.2.3 Planning each session.\nIn preparing for every session, you can plan thirty new vocabulary items, and plan to review at least that many that you have previously learned. In your plan, you will want to include at least three different kinds of language learning activities, as we did in your first session. For example, you might do one activity using vegetables. In a second activity, the LRP may have you get up and go to different parts of the house and do things that are characteristically done there. Third, you may do something with pictures. The exact nature of your three (or more) activities will change from day to day. Keep the sessions fun and interesting for both you and your LRP.\nIn addition to learning new vocabulary, you will also design your sessions to highlight specific sentence patterns. I'll give examples below. Can you see why you need to spend at least an hour per day getting ready for your time with your LRP?\nIn summary, each session should include\n1. Activities that increase your vocabulary.\n2. Activities that increase your ability to understand different types of sentences.\n3. Review of material covered in earlier sessions, integrated into what you are now learning for the first time.\n2.2.4 Your daily routine\nDuring this early phase of language learning your daily activities might include:\n1. Spend one to two hours planning and preparing for your session with your LRP.\n2. Spend one to two hours with your LRP. Your LRP will follow your instructions and use the new language to communicate with you in ways that require you to hear, process and respond. You will tape record the session.\n3. Go over the tapes, and copy summary excerpts to another tape.\n4. Listen to the abbreviated tape meaningfully (that is, in conjunction with the same pictures, objects, or actions that you used in your session), a number of times.\n5. Do your daily journal writing and record keeping.\nInitially, you will be majoring on learning to understand the language. Thus your plan for your session will aim to increase your ability to recognize vocabulary, and to understand different sentence patterns. Later I will give you a lot of specific suggestions regarding vocabulary and sentence patterns to cover in your lessons.\nThis daily pattern will change with time. Eventually you will be spending more than two hours per day with LRP s, and less time going over the tapes of the sessions. The reason for this is that initially, working with a live speaker is very demanding, and both you and the live speaker tire easily. You can relax with the tape recorder, and process the language input from your session over and over. Once you get rolling in the language, you will feel a need for much more extended live conversational interaction with your LRP.\n2.3. Some more advanced techniques for increasing your ability to understand the language\nThe kinds of activities I have been discussing so far may prove fruitful for a month or more. However, they will not quite make you a basic speaker of the language, even in terms of your comprehension ability. What I am about to suggest are techniques for moving to a new level. These activities can be thought of as helping to form a bridge between the time when you are a bare beginner and the time when you are a non-beginner. For that reason, I discuss them further in Thomson (1993b).\nFrom your very first day, you are understanding statements and instructions in the new language. What is it that makes it possible for you to understand a language that you are just beginning to learn? It is the fact that the things that you and the LRP are seeing and doing give you the meaning of the words and sentences that you are hearing. The LRP says, \"This is a man,\" and you can see what she means.\nOnce you understand a few hundred vocabulary items and a lot of basic sentence patterns, you will be able to understand much that is said even when you don't \"see the meaning\" in front of you. But your ability to understand will still be limited, and you still need to use methods which make what you are hearing easy for you to process. Think of how TPR and pictures help you during the early weeks. They help you by drastically narrowing the possibilities you need to consider while processing a sentence. For example, suppose that during one of your first sessions your LRP says \"Pick up the banana.\" You have in front of you a banana, a mango, a pineapple, and a guava. You hear \"Pick up the banana\" in the language, you process it, and you respond by picking up the banana. There were only a few possible things the LRP might have said at that point. The fact that the possibilities are limited is essential to your early ability to understand what is said. Now suppose three weeks later you are in a language session with four pictures in front of you, and your LRP says, \"Before this picture was taken, this man hitched up his oxen.\" This sentence can only apply to one of the four pictures in front of you, since there is only one picture in which a man is using a pair of oxen. You think about what you heard, process it, and understand it. Once again, you are aided in your understanding by the fact that the possibilities of what might be said are limited to things which could be said about those four pictures. Granted you are now coping with a wider range of possibilities than when you were picking up pieces of fruit, but the possibilities are still restricted by the contents of the pictures, and this is a major aid to you as you seek to process what was said to you.\nAfter a few weeks, you have become adept at understanding isolated sentences that are tied to things you see and do in the session. Now you want to work on understanding longer stretches of speech containing many sentences, and you want to be able to understand them without the aid of things you see and do in the session. This is a natural next step in your development of comprehension ability. The key to being able to understand long stretches of connected speech at this point is the same key that enabled you to understand all those isolated sentences: use techniques that restrict the number of possibilities which you need to consider. Have your LRP tell you things that have a reasonable degree of predictability. Some ways you can do this are to have the LRP tell you stories that you already know (from having heard them in English or another language), have the LRP give an account to a third party of something you and she did together, or have the LRP tell you all the steps in a familiar process.\nIf your LRP can read, you might have her read over a reasonably short English story, say in a children's book. Or you might read it to her. You should also make yourself familiar with the story, if you aren't already familiar with it. Then your LRP can retell the story to you in her language. On one occasion I had an LRP who was well versed in the Bible, as was I. During my third month of language learning he told me the entire Old Testament story of Joseph, in detail. I was able to follow a large portion of what he said, since I already knew the story. This provided me with practice in comprehending a stretch of speech which went on for a considerable period of time. Another possibility might be to watch a video drama together, and then have the LRP tell you the entire story in her language, perhaps on a subsequent day, to make it less boring.\nYou can engage in extra-curricular activities with your LRP, so that you will come to have a number of shared experiences. The LRP can recount to you any experience that you have shared. It is even better, certainly more natural, if she recounts it within your hearing to another person, preferably someone with a level of language ability comparable to your own. By all means, tape record it.\nRecounting all of the steps in a process is called the Series Method. Here again, the speech is made easier to understand by the fact that each step in the process is relatively predictable, which drastically limits the range of possibilities you have to consider as you process what you hear. Consider all the steps in preparing a potato to be fried. You pick up a potato. You turn on a tap. You pick up a brush. You hold the potato under the running water. You rub the brush back and forth against the potato. The dirt that was on the potato is washed away. The water becomes dirty. The dirty water runs down the drain. You turn off the tap. You open a drawer. You take out a potato peeler. Etc. (You can finish the series as an exercise.) Ordinary life provides hundreds of ideas for series. If the series are based on every-day mundane processes, you can bet that the vocabulary you hear and learn will be vocabulary that a basic speaker should know.\nOf course, as you listen to such extended stretches with understanding, whether they be familiar stories, accounts of shared experiences or series, or whatever, be sure that you capture them on tape so that you can listen to them many more times, and perhaps go over them with the LRP to identify spots you cannot understand, and learn what you need to know in order to be able to understand those spots.\nChapter 3. Getting on with talking\nSo far I have mainly been talking about learning to comprehend your new language. This is because I take that to be your most crucial concern during your first two months, and especially during the first month. You can go on for days, or weeks, rapidly increasing your ability to understand the language with the help of well planned language sessions. But when do you start learning to speakthe language in addition to learning to understand it? And how do you move from being someone who understands a lot to someone who speaks a lot?\n3.1. How soon should I start talking?\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is controversial, and so there can be no hard and fast rule regarding how soon you should start devoting a portion of your language sessions to producing speech in addition to understanding it. Many people think that it is important to begin speaking from day one and are surprised to learn that there may be advantages to waiting awhile. In general, I encourage people to wait awhile to start speaking, but on the other hand, I try not to discourage anyone who strongly wishes to work at speaking the language right from the start. For myself as a language learner, I do not specifically avoid speaking a language in real-life situations to the extent that I am able to and need to. I even design some of my early sessions so that they feed into my real-life communication situations. For instance, since I found that I was buying vegetables often, I chose to learn names for vegetables in an early session. Since I used taxis, I did the role play described above as a means of learning expressions which I might use in giving instructions to taxi drivers. So when I encourage you to concentrate exclusively, or almost exclusively, on learning to comprehend, I am referring to what you do in your sessions with your LRP, not so much in the outside world.\nBut, in general, you do not need to be in a hurry to start speaking the language during your first few weeks. That is entirely up to you. Postponing your production of spoken language has advantages. It also has disadvantages.\nThere are several advantages to delayed oral production. First, it takes awhile to begin hearing the new language really clearly. Some people refer to this as tuning up to the new language. It may take two or three weeks. It will be harder to use accurate pronunciation before tuning up than after, and you may begin developing poor pronunciation habits if you do a lot of speaking before you are tuned up to the language. Second, for many people, trying to respond to the LRP by speaking the new language significantly decreases the rate of learning. This may be partly due to the increased stress level. It may be partly due to the fact that it takes a lot of brain effort to recall vocabulary and phrases during the early days of language learning, so that the more you speak the language, the less brain energy you will have left for learning to comprehend new material. At any rate, if you are trying to both speak and comprehend during the early days of language learning, you are likely to cover less ground than if you concentrate on learning to comprehend only.\nThe advantages to delayed production would appear to relate mainly to the internal, psychological aspects of language learning. The disadvantages relate to external, social considerations. First of all, your LRP may not be totally sympathetic with the idea. She may feel that if you're not talking, then you're not learning. As I say, skeptical LRP s can become convinced of the value of what you are doing as they see your surprising progress in learning to understand their language. But this may be a hurdle to get over right at the beginning. Second, you may have real communicative needs that require you to speak already. Certainly, you need to be able to greet people, and show a certain degree of politeness. You may have certain absolutely essential needs, such as telling the taxi driver where you live. Third, you may have to interact with a number of speakers of the language who are expecting to see immediate evidence of your progress as a speaker of their language. Telling them that you can comprehend several hundred vocabulary items and many basic sentence patterns may not mean much to them. They would like to hear you speak, or at least you feel that they would.\nI would encourage you to think of yourself initially as a baby bird in the nest. You need to grow before you can fly. To fly you need to be fed. Your nest is your home and other locations where you can work with your LRP or listen to your tape recorder. Your food is all the language material that you are learning to comprehend. You can eventually start flapping your wings in the nest. That is, you can start engaging in two-way communication with your LRP and thus developing basic conversational ability. Finally, you get out of the nest and start flying. With practice you become a proficient flyer. If you try to fly before you've grown feathers, it can be stressful. Why not minimize the trauma by staying in the nest for awhile. Of course, you do not want to stay in the nest more than is necessary, or you'll not learn to fly. It's a matter of balance.\nHow long then, should you concentrate exclusively, or almost exclusively, on learning to understand the language before you start trying to speak, assuming you feel like waiting, as I am encouraging you to do? I think that for many people a month may be a good period of time for exclusive, or nearly exclusive, comprehension learning. The second month can be a mix of both comprehension activities and speaking activities. Now it may be that after a week or two (or less [or more]) you find that certain sentences or words just come rolling out of your mouth. You have a need to say something, and what you need to say happens to be right there on the tip of your brain right when you need it. And you just say it. Great. Don't bite your tongue. Do what feels natural.\nIf you feel that it is important that you talk a lot in your early sessions, in addition to learning to understand (and in addition to talking in real-life situations), then you'll find that you can do a lot with pictures, objects and actions. You'll want to make a point of learning to use power tools, as described in the section on survival expressions. These enable you to use the language as a means of learning more of the language.\n3.2. General principles in starting to speak the language\nTwo key features of real speech are that it is creative, and it is cooperative. When I say that speech is creative, I mean that people create the sentences they need as they need them. Many, if not most, of the sentences people utter are ones that they have never heard or uttered before and will never hear or utter again. Such creative speech is spontaneous and, it appears to the native speaker, usually effortless. Speech is cooperative in the sense that the speaker and hearer need to work together. The speaker doesn't speak in a way that will leave the hearer out in the cold. The speaker guesses at what the hearer already knows and bases what s/he says on that. The hearer may give verbal or nonverbal indications as to whether s/he understands the speaker. The hearer may ask for clarification or attempt to confirm that he or she has understood correctly. In the context of second language learning, this cooperative process is what I referred to above as the \"negotiation of meaning\".\n3.3. Survival expressions\nAs noted above, people often feel a need to know how to use certain expressions in the new language right away. This includes greetings (Hello) and leave-takings (good-bye). One speaker of an African language informed me that the way to greet someone in his language is to tell the person what s/he is doing at the time you meet him or her. Obviously, you would need to know a lot of the language in order to be able to greet people appropriately regardless of what they happen to be doing. But usually, there will be simpler means of greeting people. You may learn other expressions which serve to grease the social gears. A good way to get these is to have two native speakers do brief role-plays. For example, they can pretend they are strangers meeting for the first time, and they can pretend that they are good friends meeting in the market. The first several things they say in each case will probably fall into the category of things that grease the social gears. Another thing language learners are anxious to learn is ways to say thank you. But as to when is it necessary or apprto thank people, that will vary from culture to culture. And saying thank you may not be as important as you think. It may be that gratitude is shown in other ways, such as by facial expressions. It is also helpful to know simple ways to say I'm sorry, though again, each culture will define the exact circumstances under which such expressions are used.\nOther survival expressions are ones you need in order need to get around. This might include expressions you need to use in order to use public transportation, to purchase goods in a shop, to eat in a restaurant, to rent a hotel room, to ask directions, etc. A common strategy, which I don't really recommend, is to memorize fifty or a hundred, or perhaps two hundred, survival expressions as your first effort toward language learning. I recommend, rather, that you learn the bare minimum initially. That is because when you don't yet know much of the language, you don't really know what you are memorizing. You just learn to repeat a long stream of sound like a parrot, but you are not really using the words and phrases in the way that a true speaker does. If you really like memorizing, why not wait until you are clearly hearing the words within the sound stream and hearing them with some comprehension? Then your memorizing will be meaningful.\nThere are two alternatives to memorizing. One alternative is to record your fifty or one hundred survival expressions on tape, each one preceded and/or followed by the English (or other language) translation, and listen to it often. As the language starts becoming more meaningful to you, so will these expressions. You can later make a new tape without the English translation and perhaps relate each expression to a simple drawing that reasonably reminds you of the meaning. You can shuffle the drawings so that it takes some processing effort to relate each taped expression to the appropriate drawing. This will stimulate your mental language processor, and you'll absorb a lot of the detail of the survival expressions. When you need to use the expressions in real life, you may end up using a chopped down version, but it will be a chopped down version that is your very own, and this will probably contribute more to the development of your speaking ability than just spouting a flowery expression like a parrot, not knowing exactly what you are saying. If you follow the procedure I am suggesting, you will quickly acquire a lot of survival language, in synch with your gradually evolving speaking ability.\nThe other alternative to memorizing survival expressions is to learn them through role-play. That is what was going on in the example above where you set up the model of several city blocks and pretended you were a taxi driver, and that your LRP was a customer giving you instructions. This is reverse role-play. You want to learn expressions a customer would use to talk to the taxi driver. But you do not pretend that you are the customer, even though that is the role you need to be able to function in. The reason you don't pretend you're the customer, is that you wouldn't know what to say. So you take the role of the driver, and thus you get to hear what the customer says, and in the process you learn what customers say. In the pretend driver role you can hear, process, and respond physically by moving the car about the model town. With suitable props you can use reverse role-play to learn expressions which will be useful in just about any communication situation which you face during your early period of language learning. For example, what props might you use with your LRP in performing a role-play aimed at helping you learn how to talk to waiters in restaurants?\nOne special group of survival expressions are sometimes called power tools. These are expressions in the language that help you to learn more of the language. Examples are \"What is this called?\", \"What is that person doing?\", \"What is that thing used for?\", \"How do you say X\", \"Could you repeat that?\", \"Could you say it more slowly?\", \"Could you say it a few times in a row?\", \"Could you say it into the tape recorder?\", etc. You may be surprised to learn that you can acquire these entirely through comprehension activities. You use reverse role-play. You pretend that your LRP does not know English and that you are her LRP, helping her learn English. She asks you the power tool questions in the language you are learning, perhaps in connection with pictures, and you respond by telling her how to say things in English. She says (in the language you are learning), \"What is this called?\" and you respond (in English), \"It's called a hammer.\" She says (in her language), \"Could you say it more slowly?\", and you respond (in English) \" It's a h-a-a-a-mer-r-r.\" Follow the familiar principles of comprehension learning activities: only introduce one new power tool at a time; use lots of repetition of each new expression, randomly dispersing it among already familiar expressions, etc. It will be good if you do this role play before your first hour of heavy duty two-way communication.\n3.4. Heavy duty two-way communication: a new phase begins\nIt is common for people to take formal language courses, perhaps for several semesters, and then find that when faced with a real live monolingual speaker of the language they thought they were learning, they are able to open their mouths, but they have difficulty getting anything to come out of those wide open mouths. Recall that to be able to speak a language means to be able to take a thought and express it through words, even though you may have never expressed that exact thought through words before. So far, you have been concentrating on learning to understand the language you are learning. Now you have absorbed hundreds of vocabulary items and a good range of sentence patterns. You have the bricks and mortar that you need to make conversation. That is good. What would have been the point of trying to seriously speak the language when you hardly knew how to say a single thing?\nHowever, you only learn to speak by speaking. You may have known children of immigrant parents who could understand the parents' language fluently, but could not speak it at all. The reason they could not speak the language was that they had never tried to speak it. To become a speaker, you must try to speak. You must try to speak a lot, over a long period of time.\n3.4.1. Biting the bullet, or taking the plunge, whichever you prefer\nSo far you've been minimizing your trauma, mainly learning to comprehend the language by means of fun and games in the nest. Trying to speak too much too soon is believed to raise the stress level and slow the learning process for many people. How would you like a medium-stress experience? You've got all those bricks and mortar in your brain. For your baptism of fire, you can conduct a session in which you bar yourself and your LRP from using any English (or any other language besides the one you are learning from the LRP) for a whole hour!\nDuring that hour, there will be numerous times when you will have something you want to say and fail miserably in your effort to say it. Likewise your LRP will have things she wants to say to you, and despite her best efforts, and the desperate production of sketches, gestures and pantomime, she does not manage to get her point across. But you never break into English (or whatever) at those times. Rather, when you are unable to communicate what you intend, you jot down the idea you were unable to communicate in your notebook. Your LRP does likewise when, due to your limited comprehension ability, she fails to get her point across to you. That is, she makes a note in her notebook as to what she wanted to tell you that you were unable to understand. At the end of the hour you'll have a long list of things that you were unable to say, and she'll have a long list of things you were unable to understand.\nI'll come back to those jottings in a minute. First, I want us to think about the experience of that hour. If you were really daring, you came to that hour without any preparation. Your goal is to learn to speak in an unplanned, unprediccontext. If you were nervous, you may have had a list of topics, such as \"Life in my country,\" \"What my childhood was like,\" \"The summer of '59\", etc. However, you did not spend any time reflecting on how you would discuss these topics. That is because you want to have to cope with your communication needs on the spot, as they arise. If you found you weren't getting anywhere, you may have jumped up and ran and grabbed a photo album, but it will be a photo album that you have never gone through with your LRP before. If you didn't have such a photo album, you may have grabbed a National Geographic or something. Having lots of pictures to scaffold your efforts at speaking and comprehending will make communication quite a bit easier. You may fall back on just doing a lot of language learning using the pictures and power tool expressions (\"What is this woman doing? Why is she doing it? What will she do next?\").\nNow, back to those jottings. You have just come up with a list, rather two lists, of things you need to learn. Wasn't that useful? Those will feed into your next language session. First, you will want to go over those jottings. You'll find it fun to find out what it was that your LRP was trying to say that you were unable to figure out. She'll find it fun to learn what in the world you were trying to say at those times when she was unable to make heads or tails out of your speech.\nYou may find the idea of a whole hour of communication in the new language a bit frightening, especially if this is the first time you have seriously spoken this language. You may prefer to spend a half hour, broken by a ten minute recess when you can discuss the jottings you made, followed by a second half hour. Let the daring among us start with a whole hour, non-stop. The rest, including me, can break it into two halves with a ten minute recess midway.\n3.4.2. Incorporating heavy duty two-way communication into your daily language learning\nLet's assume that you have spent a month concentrating mainly on learning to understand the language, and now you are starting some serious speaking. It is time to increase the number of people you regularly talk to. After all, you can use several hundred basic vocabulary and many basic sentence patterns, perhaps somewhat brokenly. Increasingly you will want to spend part of your \"work day\" in informal visiting. You might visit your LRP's friends or family. Or you might visit neighbors or people with whom you have done business. Don't be embarrassed to tell them that you are looking for opportunities to converse in the language. This may cause people to interpret conversing with you as doing you a favour. That is exactly what it is at this point. Believe me, it is work for them. You will probably end up owing some favours in return.\nSomething else I would urge you to strongly consider at this point is hiring a second LRP, this time one who does not know English (or any other language that you know well). You might then have two sessions per day, one with your first LRP, and one with your new one. This will allow you a lot more opportunity for conversational practice in the security of your nest.\n3.4.2.1. Some techniques to help you keep talking\nWhen you first start trying to carry on extended talk, it can be agonizing. Eventually it gets easier. What makes it easier? Practice. Lots and lots of practice. Now your speech will be--well--it will be your speech. You'll sound like someone who is just beginning, with great effort, to speak the language. Expect to make countless \"mistakes\". Believe it or not, the main thing which will decrease your mistakes is not being corrected every time you make one, but simply talking and talking and talking, while all the time continuing to be exposed to speech that you can understand. Constant correction takes the focus away from communication. Encourage your LRP to allow you to make lots of mistakes, and focus on communication rather than on grammatical accuracy. Right now you need to loosen up your tongue. When your tongue is good and loose in your new language, you can start worrying about decreasing your errors. Remember, your goal right now is not to become a perfect speaker. Your goal is to become some kind of speaker. Later you can work on becoming a perfect speaker.\n3.4.2.1.1. Learn to converse on chosen topics\nWith your first LRP, you want to continue achieving your daily goals for new vocabulary and sentence patterns, using comprehension learning methods. In addition, you can devote part of each session to free conversation. During your preparation time, decide on a topic--something you would like to be able to talk about outside of your sessions with friends or people you meet. In your session, attempt to conduct a conversation with your LRP on that topic. During the conversation, refuse to switch to English when you get stuck. Both of you should jot down the things you are unable to express or understand. After the conversation, go over these jottings. In some cases the problem will be due to your not knowing specific words or phrases. In other cases there may be a sentence pattern that you need to learn.\nPrepare comprehension activities for your next session through which you can learn these words or sentence patterns. (You may want to use home-made drawings, even simple stick figures, in the comprehension activities.)\nThe next day, you can attempt once again to have a conversation on that topic, or maybe conduct a conversation in which you talk about all you learned in connection with that topic the day before.\nIf you have a second LRP who does not know English (or any other language you already know well), then you will have another opportunity to have a lengthy conversation on the topic of choice. In addition, as you visit friends, you will have a third context in which to discuss the topic, now that you know how to discuss it.\n3.4.2.1.2. Conversation practice through role-play.\nIn addition to learning to discuss a variety of important topics, you can now engage in elaborate role-plays. Your role-play with the model town and toy car was extremely simple and artificial. Now you and your LRP can have serious role-plays. Keep a list of all the situations in which you could use the language. One situation might be hiring an employee. You might have your two LRP s do a role-play of that situation, one of them pretending she is hiring the other. You could tape-record this and listen to the tape numerous times. You can go over it with either or both of your LRP s, discussing at length any parts you do not understand, discussing all that is said, and how it is said. Now, in your next session, you can take the opposite role from the one you have in real life and do the role-play with your LRP. Then you can take the actual role you have in real life and do the same role-play again with your LRP.\n3.4.2.1.3. Use the series method, but you be the speaker.\nI recommended the Series Method above as a way to keep the speech you hear somewhat predictable and thus easier to process. It is also useful as a means of keeping yourself talking. One problem with speaking is simply coming up with ideas of things to talk about. If you tell all the steps in a process, you will find that each statement you make will suggest the next statement in the series. You can use a series that you have already heard your LRP say, and perhaps tape-recorded and listened to several times. But remember, your point is not to memorize and talk like a parrot. So you would tell the series in your own words. Those will often be very close to the words your LRP used, but you are not saying the whole sentence from memory. Rather you are remembering the next step in the process, and saying it on the basis of your speaking ability. Alternatively, you can make up a series which you have not heard your LRP tell. This will turn up holes in your speaking ability. Don't stop while you're telling the series, but jot down a note as to the nature of any problems you have for later reference. Then go over your jottings with the LRP to find out how to say what you were unable to say.\n3.4.2.1.4. Tell tales\nYou can tell your LRP astories you know. These might be familiar children's tales, such as Little Red Riding Hood. Or they can be accounts of experiences from your past or present. It is a good idea each day, for awhile, to recount everything you did the day before. Again, you will make jottings whenever you are unable to say something that you want to say, rather than break back into English.\n3.4.2.1.5. Focus on structure\nAt times you may feel troubled by some particular aspect of the language which you cannot get the hang of. We gave the example above of sentences which focus on a past process in progress, such as \"When this picture was taken, the man was ploughing.\" Imagine that this is a pattern that you find difficult. Then you should construct a comprehension activity to highlight this sentence pattern. Often this can be done using pictures in the manner I suggested above. Next you can use the same set of pictures, but change roles with your LRP, so that you become the speaker, and she responds by indicating which pictures you are describing. Finally, you can take out a new set of pictures and describe them for her, using the same sentence pattern with picture after picture. If you have fifty new pictures, you will use the pattern fifty times in extemporaneous communication.\nWith a little planning you can design an activity using TPR, pictures, the series method, or another activity so as to highlight any structure you wish to emphasize. Suppose you want to improve your ability to use a sentence pattern which has a meaning similar to English sentences with \" used to\", as in, \"I used to shop at the Bay.\" As an exercise right now, think up a conversational context which would allow you to use this pattern over and over and imagine the form such a conversation might take.\nIt may seem that when you use activities to emphasize specific structures you are not really focusing on the structures themselves. Rather you are using the structure in communication. That is desirable, actually, because your goal is to be able to use the structure in communication, not to just produce it on demand!\n3.4.3. Biting another bullet, or taking another plunge, as you wish\nRemember how hard it was for you to go cold turkey, abandoning English for a whole hour back when you first got into serious talking? Well, now that you're a couple of months into your new language, take a deep breath. Make a covenant with your LRP that neither of you will use English (or whatever) for an entire week. To make it more fun, have your LRP actually live with you for that week, or you go and live with her. Believe me, it will be a riot.\nAfter that, if you have not already done so, it will be time to develop a rich social life (see Thomson 1993c for detailed suggestions). You are now in a position to begin new relationships entirely in the new language, even with people who know quite a bit of English (or whatever other languages you knew before you started learning this one). These relationships will be substantially different than the relationships you would build using English (or whatever), since you will be the communicative underdog. Good. Anybody can be a communicative overdog. It's a privilege to be able to be the underdog. If you are learning a minority language, its speakers may find it refreshing to finally have the upper hand in communication with an outsider such as you. You may find it painful to be a broken, struggling speaker of a language. But others have lived through it. You will too. If you don't have to, you'll be tempted not to. So if at all possible, develop a good number of relationships with people who do not know English (or whatever). This is possible in most situations, though not all.\nChapter 4. Ideas for vocabulary and sentence patterns to learn to comprehend in order to become a basic speaker\nWhen I described your typical daily activities during the early weeks of language learning, you may have been wondering how you would ever come up with enough ideas for vocabulary and sentence patterns to fill all those daily language sessions. Most of the rest of what I have to say is my way of filling in those details. These details may help to clarify much of what I've said about the daily sessions of your early weeks. It might be good to go back and reread those earlier sections after you have surveyed my suggestions.\nAs I give you this long list of suggestions for vocabulary and sentence patterns to learn, don't expect to remember it all after the first reading. It will be there for you to return to over and over while planning your daily language sessions.\nFirst, let's see where we've been. I have attempted to give a picture of your first two months as a language learner in which your first major emphasis is on learning to understand the language, believing that your short term and long term progress will be increased if you approach the language in that way. Using TPR, pictures, and simple role-play, you can quickly acquire enough vocabulary items and sentence patterns to qualify as a basic speaker of the language. Gradually you put increasing emphasis on using the language to talk, using vocabulary and sentence patterns that you have already learned to understand. By the end of the second month, your sessions may last for two or three (or more) hours during which you may devote half of the time to comprehension activities and half of the time to two-way conversational activities.\nNow, regarding the areas of vocabulary and sentence patterns I am about to survey, unfortunately, I cannot be totally concrete. I cannot truly suggest vocabulary items and sentence patterns, since the ones that exist will vary considerably from language to language. Rather I will attempt to cover a healthy range of general categories of vocabulary and sentence patterns. I'll have to give English words and phrases and sentences in order to be concrete, but realize that the actual details of how English works will not match up very often with the details of how another language works.\nTo take just one example, we have past tense forms in English which are different from present and future forms. In some languages there will be no such thing as tense. Nevertheless, you need to know how to describe events which happened in the past. In other languages there may be two or three different kinds of past tense, such as remote past and recent past. I cannot foresee every such distinction you might encounter, and I won't even try. What I will do is provide enough possibilities so that if you learn to deal with everything I suggest, any other absolutely essential matters will come to your notice in the process. Remember, you're just trying to become a basic speaker right now. There are tons of details which you will not master during your first two months. I am trying to steer you toward the most important ones that you can reasonably master in that time period if you concentrate heavily on learning to understand and accept more modest goals when it comes to learning to speak.\n4.1. Some ideas for vocabulary to learn to understand\nRemember, you are not simply collecting and compiling vocabulary for eventual memorization. You are learning to recognize the vocabulary items when you hear them in speech. You want to be prepared to learn to recognize around thirty new items per day. If these are the names of common objects, then you will want to use the actual objects in the language session, if possible. Your LRP will have you manipulate these objects as a means of learning their names or as a means of learning the words for the actions that can be performed on, or with, those objects. To learn other kinds of vocabulary, you may need to prepare drawings or diagrams. You can plan to learn a wide variety of words by means of acting them out in TPR activities. For example, if you are learning words for emotions, you may respond to commands such as \"Act happy; act sad; act disappointed,\" and so forth.\n4.1.1. Which vocabulary items should I learn first?\nLearning a language means learning thousands of vocabulary items. During your kick-start phase of language learning, you might aim to learn your first thousand vitems. Remember, you will start out as a poor speaker and gradually improve. So the first vocabulary you'll want to learn will be the vocabulary that even a poor speaker would know. Think of English for a moment. Some words would be important even for a poor speaker, while other words would be suitable only to a more advanced speaker. Consider the following words for facial expressions or facial movements: blink, grimace, smile. Which of those would be the most important for a poor speaker to learn first? Which would be least important? If you are like me, you feel that smile is more important than blink which in turn is more important than grimace. I can almost bet that you feel exactly the same as I do about this. In using English, people use smile more frequently than they use blink, while they do not use grimace very often at all. Native speakers of a language will probably have a good sense for which words are high frequency words, and which are less frequent, and, hence, less important. Hopefully, you'll be able to convey to your LRP your desire to learn high frequency words at first.\nEven without the help of your LRP, you will have some sense of what words are important. If you are aware of some area of vocabulary that you will have the opportunity to use in the near future, that will be a good area of vocabulary to work on. Suppose that vegetable vendors come to your door every day. Then it would make sense to learn to recognize the words for all the vegetables they sell. Buy a few of every vegetable, and use them in your sessions until you easily recognize all of their names. You are then free to speak them to the vendors, even if it is just a matter of showing the vendors what you have learned. While you are doing your daily planning, it is good to ask yourself what specific areas of vocabulary you can work on that are relevant to daily activities.\nHowever, you cannot limit yourself to vocabulary items that obviously fit into your daily activities, or you will never learn a lot of high frequency, important vocabulary. For example, unless you are doing medical work, you may not need to talk about body parts all the time. But what sort of a \"speaker\" would you be if you didn't know what a foot or hand is called? Follow your own instincts and those of your LRP in deciding what are the essential vocabulary for even a poor speaker like you. (Perhaps instead of calling you a poor speaker, I should call you an on-the-way-to-becoming-a-good-speaker, or maybe a temporarily challenged speaker.)\n4.1.2. Some categories of vocabulary\nI am going to suggest some categories of essential vocabulary for you as a basic speaker of the language. However, I encourage you to only refer to this list when you run short of ideas from other sources. Keep examining every aspect of your daily life in the situation where you will be using the language and identify the objects, places, and activities that will be important to you. Let those be your inspiration in choosing vocabulary to learn. If you are preparing for a session and you run short on ideas, scan the following suggestions. According to my most conservative tally, if the language you are learning is that of a group of people with a rudimentary material culture, these suggestions should yield five hundred vocabulary items. In most situations they should yield at least a thousand. It would be a good exercise for you, as homework, to flesh out these categories by listing a number of common English words that would fall under each one. Some \"words\" will actually be phrases. For example, old man could be treated as a vocabulary item, since it is such an essential category of human beings. By way of contrast, tall man would not be considered a vocabulary item, although both tall and man would be important items.\nIf you keep a log of the vocabulary you learn, the items in your log will suggest new possibilities for vocabulary. The word for water may be in your log. Then think of all the things you can say about water: it flows, drips, freezes, boils, soaks into things, soaks through things, leaks out of things, people pour it, splash it, spray it, etc. etc.\n4.1.2.1. Words for referring to human beings\n-- Personal pronouns (I, you, them, we, etc., etc.--see discussion below)\n-- Major categories of humans by age and sex (man, girl, adult, youth, etc.)\n-- Major ethnic categories of humans (names for other tribes, nationalities, language groups)\n-- Categories of friends, acquaintances, and relatives (for relatives, a family tree diagram can be used, or pictures of someone's various relatives. Don't expect the terms to correspond to the ones used in English. The whole kinship system may be wildly different.)\n-- Occupational or sociopolitical categories of people (plumber, president, beggar)\n-- Common personal names (It is a big help to be able to recognize and repeat, and easily remember, the names of people you meet.)\n4.1.2.2. Items used by human beings\n-- Animals (draft animals, herded animals, pets, etc.)\n-- Items used for transportation (and their parts)\n-- Items used in building and construction\n-- Cooking and eating utensils\n-- Items for growing or acquiring food\n-- Household items\n-- Items found outside of houses\n-- Items related to education, learning, communication\n-- Items used for recreation or entertainment\n-- Clothing, make-up, jewelry, etc.\n-- Items used for religion or magic\n-- Items used for curing or healing\n-- Items used in trade or business\n4.1.2.3. Places frequented by humans\n-- Homes and their parts\n-- Locations near homes and residential areas\n-- Locations where food is gathered or grown, and their parts\n-- Locations where recreation, socializing, religious activities take place\n-- Locations where business transactions take place (for example, different types of shops and their parts)\n-- Place names (well-known villages, towns, cities, countries, lakes, rivers, etc.)\n4.1.2.4. Common substances not yet covered\n-- Water, earth, glass, rubber, plastic, paper, wood, stone, grass, thatch, etc.\n4.1.2.5. Nature\n-- Geological objects (rivers, islands, mountains, etc.), and related phenomena (flowing rivers, landslides)\n-- Astronomical objects\n-- Common plants and their parts/substances\n-- Common wild animals\n-- Body parts (major external and internal ones)\n-- Body substances\n-- Today, tomorrow, morning, evening, hours of the day, days of the week, months, seasons\n4.1.3. Words used to further describe all of the objects covered so far\n-- Terms used in describing human beings' appearances\n-- Terms used in describing character/personality\n-- Terms used to describe emotional states, attitudes\n-- Other terms that come to mind in connection with all of the categories of humans mentioned above (Look them over in your vocabulary log!)\n-- Colours, sizes, shapes, textures, conditions, values, etc. of objects\n-- Quantities, including numbers (many, a few, ten, etc.)\n-- Qualifiers of adjectives (very, slightly, etc.)\n4.1.4. Things that happen to all of the objects covered so far\n-- Ways that the objects change their location or position (fall, roll, etc.)\n-- Ways that the condition of objects changes (burn up, wear out, etc.)\n4.1.5. Actions of human beings\n-- Bodily actions (Look over all of the body part terms in your vocabulary log, and think of everything you can do with each body part, or what they do, as well as whole-body actions.)\n-- Things people do with or to any of the objects covered so far (go over all your object words for ideas)\n-- Things done by people according to their occupational categories (farmer, beggar, etc.)\n-- Things which people do to or for other people\n4.1.6. Additional sources for basic vocabulary\n-- Have several people remember every single action they performed, from rising in the morning to retiring at night on a given day.\n-- Observe common activities of daily life with all of the stages or steps in those activities; take photos if possible.\nWith the right activities in your daily sessions with your LRP, assuming you spend adequate time planning and preparing for those activities, you shoulfind it possible to learn thirty new vocabulary items per day until you have learned your first thousand items. Don't forget to keep a log of all the vocabulary you learn to recognize, and add to it during your daily record keeping period.\n4.2. Sentence patterns you need to be able to understand as a basic speaker\nAs you plan your sessions with your LRP, you are thinking about more than vocabulary. You are also learning to understand sentences which contain the vocabulary items. You plan your sessions so that in most of them one or more segments of the session highlights a particular sentence pattern or more than one pattern (perhaps two or three contrasting patterns). In the process, you will get exposure to many sentence patterns that you didn't specifically plan on. For example, the sentence patterns for various types of questions (\"Where did you go?\" \"What did you see?\" \"When did you return?\") may be on your list as something you plan to tackle at some time in the future. When that time comes, you may discover that you have already learned many of those question patterns while you thought you were working on something else. You may have learned to understand questions about locations while you were learning to talk about the rooms in your house with the aid of your sketched floor plan. The suggestions below are intended as a checklist. If you come to one of my suggested types of sentence patterns and feel that you have already learned to understand such sentences, then just check it off. I really don't intend for people to cover the suggestions exactly in the order given. It is good in general, just the same, to gradually move from simpler patterns to more complex ones, as I have done.\n4.2.1. General principles about sentence patterns\nWhat we are dealing with now takes us into--gasp--grammar. At a very broad level, there are similarities in the grammar systems of different languages. An expert can see that. It may be far less obvious to the language learner, who may be unable to see the forest for the trees. For many languages, published descriptions of the grammar do not exist. If a published grammar description does exist, it may seem overwhelming the first time you look at it. Once you are well on your way into using the language as a communicator, you'll find that all that grammatical detail is not as bad as you thought it was when you first looked at it. As your speaking ability grows, you'll be amazed how much of that grammar just becomes a part of you. What is left will be easier to tackle. You don't need to worry about everything all at once. You want to start with simple things, and build up gradually to more complex ones.\nYou may hear comments about the complexity of some aspect of the language you are learning, comments such as, \"There are hundreds of verb forms.\" What exactly that means depends on the language. But I suspect it is never as bad as it sounds. There will be certain forms that are the most important ones, and the less important ones will follow patterns. It is impossible to go into detail on this, but take my word for it.\nThere may be a lot of irregular forms. In English we form the past tense of a verb by adding -ed. For example, walk becomes walked, and talk becomes talked. However there are some verbs that have an irregular past tense. That is, they don't follow any rule. The past of go is went. No matter. Just learn the irregular forms as separate vocabulary items. So what if it adds a few dozen vocabulary items?\nIn some languages there may be a lot more irregularity. So, for example, given the present tense form of a verb, it may be impossible to predict exactly what the past tense form will be (though there will be some similarity). That would mean that for every verb you would have to learn two forms, one for present tense, and one for past tense. Even then, it is likely they will fall into groups that behave similarly. (The irregularity may not necessarily have to do with tense--I just use that as an example of irregularity in general, even irregularity in words other than verbs.)\nYes, some parts of some languages can be very complex, but you don't have to get everything perfect to become a basic speaker. You'll have lots of time to grapple with the complexity, little by little. In general, this complexity will not make it harder for you to learn to understand the language. Once you are hearing the language with good understanding, you'll hear those complex forms over and over, and they will start to become familiar. Later on you may really want to get every detail right in your own speech, but remember, we are only considering the initial month or two. Right now your goal is to learn to understand enough basic sentence patterns that people can generally get their meanings across to you, with effort, and you can generally get your meanings across to them, with their help.\nAnother area of complexity has to do with nouns falling into different classes. For example, in French every noun is said to be either masculine or feminine. Some languages have several classes of nouns that are largely unpredictable. The noun class is important because you need to know it in order to know which form of adjective or verb or some other word to use with that noun. Fortunately, you don't have to know the class a noun belongs to in order to understand the language. The native speaker who speaks to you will do it correctly, and you will be able to understand what is said. Over the long term, it will be challenging for you to develop accuracy in using noun classes when you are the speaker, but while you are just a basic speaker you can expect to make mistakes, knowing that they will not usually interfere with communication.\nIn general, no matter how much people howl over the alleged complexity of some language, that complexity will affect the ease with which you learn to understand the language far less than it will affect the ease with which you learn to produce it in speech, and your ability to speak intelligibly will be affected less than your ability to speak accurately. So have no fear. You can move right ahead with rapidly learning to comprehend a lot of the language. Then you can move right into being a struggling, inaccurate, but intelligible speaker. Finally, you can gradually move on to being a fluent and accurate speaker. Remember, all we're concerned with right now is becoming struggling speakers, albeit genuine speakers.\nBefore talking about different categories of sentence patterns, we ought to think for a moment about the different functions of sentences. The patterns serve the functions. Three of the major functions of language are to get people to do things (this involves commands and requests), to get people to give you information (this involves questions), and to give people information (this involves making statements). As you work on the types of expressions described below, using the types of methods described above, you are likely to involve yourself in all three of these broad functions of language. However, at this stage there is an over-riding function in the LRP's use of the language with you, and that is to enable you to learn the language. The LRP is saying much of what she says with a view to helping you to learn things you did not know before, to strengthen your knowledge of things you have previously learned, to find out what you have successfully learned, and to allow you to demonstrate your learning and to feel good about it. The LRP will not have thought all of this through in these terms, but I can just about guarantee you that these will be among her main concerns, and increasingly so as you increasingly train her.\nWhen it comes to the actual details of the grammar systems of different languages, there is no way I can give specific suggestions of things to cover in your sessions with your LRP, since languages vary widely at just about every point. Fortunately, I can give suggestions that are likely to lead you into learning to comprehend a good variety of sentence patterns in any language. That will help you to become a basic speaker. From there on, the language will lead you more amore deeply into itself. You just have to get a foothold. Become some kind of a speaker. Then communicate a lot with people for a long time. You'll become a good speaker eventually.\nSo let's consider some of the kinds of sentence patterns that you will want to learn to understand as a basic speaker of the language. In each case I will give examples of sentence patterns that might be used with TPR (usually object manipulation) and/or pictures (either loose, or pasted in a book). These two techniques tend to be enough to cover just about any sentence pattern. I find that either technique by itself is not enough, but where one technique fails, the other typically comes to the rescue.\nMy suggestions (usually in the form of English sentences such as \"When this picture was taken, it was about to rain\") are mainly there to show you that it is possible to learn these sentence patterns by these comprehension learning techniques. If you come up with your own techniques and approaches to specific patterns, that's even better. If you attempt to follow my suggestions, you'll need to extend them to include numerous examples. You will do that during your preparation for your language sessions. As an exercise, why don't you make up a few of your own example sentences each time you read one of mine. That will increase your confidence that you can do it. In your sessions you'll give your LRP a few illustrative examples (in English, say) of the sentence pattern you are interested in. She will then make up sentences for picture after picture, following the general pattern you suggested. Thus, if you have a hundred pictures, she may make up a hundred sentences. She will be describing the pictures to you or referring to them in one way or another, and you will hear what she says, process it in your brain, and respond in some way.\n4.2.2. Learning to understand simple descriptions and instructions\nRemember, you are not going to use the following suggestions as a guide to collecting pretty sentence patterns for your notebook. Your activities are aimed rather at enabling you to understand them when you hear them in speech. And you learn to understand them in speech by having the experience of understanding them in speech over and over during your language sessions.\n4.2.2.1. Bare bones\nSince languages are complicated, it helps to begin by restricting yourself to a small subset of the more essential sentence patterns. These then serve as a skeleton. Some complexity cannot be avoided even at the outset. Our goal is to keep it manageable.\n4.2.2.1.1. Learning to understand sentences that identify and describe\nThis is a logical starting point. When the LRP tells you in the new language \"This is a man,\" she is not really telling you that the person is a man, since you can see that for yourself. Rather she is informing you that men are called \"X\" or \"Y\" or whatever they are called. Likewise, when she asks you \"Where is the man?\", it is not because she wants to know where the man is. She is looking at him. She wants you to show that you understand the word by which men are referred to. (Such questions are sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"display questions,\" since the point is to get you to display your understanding rather than to get you to supply information that the speaker needs.)\nThere may be languages in which it is unnatural to say \"This is a man\" when what is meant is \"These guys are called 'men'.\" Assuming this is not the case, your early lessons will contain many simple descriptions of objects. At first, this may simply involve naming the object, as in \"This is a man.\"\nTechniques: You will be hearing lots of identificational sentences from your first language session. Going through your photos, the LRP can tell you \"This is a man, this is a woman, etc.\" There will also be plural cases: \"These are some boys.\"\nThe LRP can also use simple identificational sentences with the objects you manipulate in your sessions. \"This is a pencil. These are some pencils.\"\n4.2.2.1.2. Combining descriptive words with names for objects\nIn addition to learning to recognize names for objects, such as pencil, cup, string, you can easily learn to recognize complex descriptions which include things like colour, size, shape, condition, or quantity of objects. This is also a good time to cover words like this and that, if they exist.\nYou will also want to learn to understand sentences in which combinations of objects are named together: \"Take a green pencil and a red pencil\".\nTechniques: The LRP will use object manipulation instructions such as \"Take a green pencil. Take two red pencils. Take a long yellow string. Take ten small nails, and a large nail. Take some of the screws and all the nails.\"\n4.2.2.1.3. Simple instructions\nBefore going on with identifications and descriptions, we need to parenthetically think about instructions, since they are one of the main means by which the LRP will teach you vocabulary and sentence patterns. For example, while teaching you by means of the descriptive sentence \"This is the bathroom,\" she may test your understanding by saying \"Point to the bathroom\". Giving instructions involves sentence forms that are used to issue commands and requests. These are dangerous sentence forms. I don't mean to make you paranoid, but in real life language use, it is in the area of issuing commands and requests that people are the most cautious about not offending one another, and not embarrassing themselves (see Brown and Levinson 1978) . If I were teaching someone English by TPR, I would be tempted to use simple command forms: \"Stand up; Sit down; Stand up when I step in front of the girl wearing a green blouse,\" and so forth.\nBut now imagine that the people I am teaching go into a restaurant and want someone to hand them a newspaper that is lying on a vacant table. They can say \"Gimme that newspaper.\" But that would sound abrupt and rude. A native speaker of English would say something such as \"Could I bother you to hand me that paper?\" However, it would be strange if my TPR sessions consisted entirely of sentences like \"Could I get you to stand up? Would you mind sitting down? When I stand in front of the girl wearing a green blouse, I'd appreciate it if you would stand up, if you don't mind.\" In terms of how we use English, such polite forms of request would be odd during TPR exercises. That is because it would sound as though I, the speaker, needed the person I was addressing to stand up, sit down, etc., and that I felt I was imposing on the person. That is, it would sound as though I were trying to get the person to do these things for my benefit.\nIn many languages similar dilemmas will arise. Depending on the language and culture, there may be far more concern for politeness than there is in English. In other languages the ways of being polite may be less obvious, but they will still be there. I have two suggestions for coping with this dilemma. First of all, have the LRP use the most polite forms that still sound natural when giving you instructions. There is no point in having the most impolite forms be the main ones you hear. Second, use role-plays for some of your TPR exercises. The LRP might instruct you to remove books from your bookshelf pretending that they are items in a shop which she wishes to look at or purchase. Now it will be more natural for her to use more elaborate polite forms: \"Could you please show me the red book on the top shelf? And I'd like to see the brown one just below it.\"\nApart from these concerns about politeness, learning to recognize the command forms of sentences should not be too difficult.\nTechniques: TPR. You may find that there is a different form depending on whether the command is issued to a single person or to two people. If you have a co-learner, then this contrast will emerge naturally. The LRP can vary the command between the singular form and the plural form, and the two of you can respond accordingly.\n4.2.2.1.4. Identification and description of actions and experiences\nThis is where you go beyond hearing \"This is a man\" and \"This is a hammer\", and hear things such as \"This man is holding a hammer\".\nTechniques: Recall that I suggested that ideal pictures for this stage of language learning would involve people as central characters, and the people would be involved with inanimate objects or other people. If you began by using the pictures to learn to recognize the words for people and then the words for objects they are using or are otherwise involved with, you will be in a position to use the same pictures to learn expressions which describe what the people are doing with or to the inanimate objects.\nThe words for man, woman, boy, girl, etc. are easier to learn than the words for the objects they are using or otherwise involved with, since every picture has a man, woman, boy, girl, etc. and there are only five or ten words to learn (including plural forms). Learning to recognize words requires lots of repeated use of each word. Since there are lots of pictures of men, women, etc., you are guaranteed lots of repetition by the time you have gone through fifty or a hundred pictures. In the case of the objects the people are using or otherwise involved with, there may be only one picture of a given object. Here the LRP will need to drill you by asking you questions: \"Where is the hammer, where is the saw, where is the stove? The saw? The hammer? The table? The stove?\". You follow the principle of only introducing one or two new items at a time, and drilling on them until you respond easily when you hear the new items randomly interspersed among items you have learned earlier.\nOnce you are familiar with the words for the people in your pictures and the objects they are involved with, it will be a simple step to understanding statements about what those people are doing to, or with, those objects.\n4.2.2.1.5. Understanding who is doing it to whom.\nConsider the sentence \"This dog is chasing this cat.\" (I'm assuming you have a picture of a dog chasing a cat, of course.) This sentence involves a dog, a cat, and an act of chasing. One animal is doing the chasing. Linguists would say that the animal who is actively, willfully, doing the chasing is the agent. The other animal is getting chased. That animal is the patient. Technically, the cat is an experiencer, since it is aware that it is being chased, but we can use the term patient broadly to mean \"the one or thing directly affected by the action of the agent\". So we have an agent chasing a patient. Since the cat is the one directly affected by the action (chasing) of the agent (the dog), the cat is the patient. Without looking at the picture, going only on the basis of the sentence \"This dog is chasing this cat,\" how can we know that the agent is the dog and the patient is the cat? Of course, we already know that dogs chase cats and cats don't chase dogs. This is called real-world knowledge. Real-world knowledge will often help you to understand sentences in the new language. But you can also tell that the dog is the agent and the cat is the patient from the way the sentence is put together, and in the long run that is more important for you as a language learner. Simple English sentences typically have the agent ( this dog) followed by the verb (is chasing) followed by the patient (this cat). Thus, even though it violates your real world expectations, you can still understand a sentence such as \"That cat is chasing that dog.\" You will understand that the cat is the agent (doing the chasing) and the dog is the patient (getting chased), because of the order in which they occur in the sentence.\nNow different languages will use different means of indicating who is doing the chasing and who is getting chased. The evidence may be found in the order of the words, as in English. It may be found in special markings on the nouns (called case markings). It may be found in markings on the verb which somehow tell you which animal is doing the chasing and which one is getting chased. If you are interested in more detail, you need to take a linguistics course that deals with grammar from a cross-language standpoint. My main point here is that you need to learn how to tell who is doing what to whom in sentences in the language.\nThere are some sentences which appear to have a subject and an object in English but where the subject is not doing anything to the object. An example is Margie likes my sister, where the subject is Margie and the object is my sister. In this sentence the subject, Margie, is an experiencer, and not an agent. Make sure you include such sentences among those you learn to comprehend, as they may behave differently from other sentences with subjects and objects.\nIn sentences with subjects and no objects (intransitive sentences), there are at least two types of subjects to consider. Some subjects are agents, that is, doers, like Margie, in the sentence Margie shouted. Other subjects do not do anything, but rather they have something happen to them. An example is tree, in the sentence The tree fell. In some languages words like sick, and angry, are actually verbs with non-agent subjects. (In other languages they are adjectives.)\nTechniques: Early on, you may concentrate on learning to understand sentences with agent subjects and patient objects. Your collection of pictures provides a good opportunity for this. Your LRP can take several dozen pictures in which someone is holding something or someone else. She can describe pictures in random order. Your job is to point to the picture being described. \"A woman is holding a baby; a boy is holding a ball; a man is holding a hammer;\" and so forth. Other verbs which can be used with many pictures are using, touching, looking at (or seeing). If there is a verb with a meaning similar to the English verb have, it can used: \"A woman has a baby; a boy has a ball;\" and so forth. (Even if there is no verb similar to have, there will probably be some way to express the meaning of \"This man has a hammer\". It will be an important sentence pattern for you to learn to recognize.) It is good if your LRP can use many sentences with the same verb, or one of a very small number of verbs. That way, only the subject and object (or agent and patient) will vary from one picture description to the next. This will enable you to work on learning to recognize who is doing the action and who or what the action is being done to without having to worry about learning a large number of verbs at the same time.\nOften your TPR expressions such as \"Pick up the nail\" involve a verb with an object. What is commonly missing is the subject, since it is typically understood to be the one addressed (that is, the second person--you), and not explicitly mentioned. Just the same, these sentences give you lots of exposure to the verbs with objects. A slight variation is for you to have your co-learner perform actions and have your LRP describe them. You can later listen to the tape recording of this and try to envision in your mind's eye what was happening in your session as your LRP uttered each sentence (assuming you didn't videotape the language sessions).\n4.2.2.1.6. You and me and he or she or somebody\nWhile you are learning how to understand who does what to whom, don't forget the most important people: you, your LRP, and your co-learner(s). One of the earliest set of expressions you want to learn are the ones with meanings such as those expressed in English by the words I, we, you, he/she, they. In English, these are separate words which we call pronouns. In other languages they may appear to be attached to the verb. In some languages you will find that they are often omitted. The exact set of pronouns will vary from language to language. It should emerge as you work at learning them.\nTechniques: You can learn to recognize the pronoun forms through TPR. For example, the LRP can tell you \"Touch me. Touch them.\" For second person (\"you\") forms, the LRP can use predictions rather than instructions: \"She is going to touch you.\" Your co-learner would then touch you, in fulfillment of the prediction. Or she could say, \"You are going to touch her.\" You need to hear each pronoun both as agent (who does the touching) and as patient (who gets touched). There should be a number of verbs in addition touch which can be used for this purpose: push, pat, pinch, punch, look at. Be sure to also include reflexive forms as in \"Touch yourself; pat yourself,\" and reciprocal forms, as in \"Touch each other; pat each other\".\nThis is a case where it is good to have several learners involved at the same time. Once when I was doing some beginning Arabic learning with an LRP I found it helpful that my co-learner was of the opposite gender from me, since gender was important in Arabic pronouns, even more so than in English. However, we realized that to work on the pronouns we really needed six co-learners, three male and three female, in order to cover all of the possibilities. I have been known to drag all six of my children into the room to use in a session where the co-learners were my wife and I. (We later wished that our children had been able to participate in all of the learning, rather than just being used as props for learning pronouns or kinship terms.)\nAgain, you can have the LRP describe what people do in addition to telling people to do things. Thus you, your co-learner, the two of you, the LRP, the LRP and you, the LRP and your co-learner, or all three of you, can perform actions, and the LRP can describe them (\"You are doing X\" \"She is doing Y\" \"We are doing \"Z\"). Again, if there are four or five co-learners for this there will be more possibilities and more flexibility.\n4.2.2.1.7. To whom, where, with what, with whom, from where, to where, for whom and whose?\nNow, I have so far encouraged you to learn to recognize who is the subject in a sentence and who is the object (or at least who is the agent and who is the patient). You should plan activities with your LRP through which you learn to do this with sentences in which the subject or object is a noun (man), a personal name (John ), or any of the pronouns (I, me, you, they, etc.). Remember, you are spending at least an hour in planning before each session. Hopefully, you have a co-learner so the two of you can demonstrate to the LRP what is desired, whenever the LRP gets confused.\nYou also want to go beyond recognizing nouns and pronouns as subjects and objects of sentences. They can also be indirect objects: \"Give the green cup to me, and give the glass to her\". They can be beneficiaries: \"Draw a circle for me.\" They can be parts of location phrases: \"Put the round paper in front of John, and put the long paper in front of yourself.\" They can be possessors: \"Pick up my banana; Place it beside that woman's banana\". They can be instruments as in \"Pick up the banana with the fork.\" Or they can be associates: \"Walk across the room with your husband.\" Other important functions of nouns in sentences include the source from which a movement begins, and the goal to which a movement is directed: \"Walk from the table and to the door.\"\nTechniques: TPR. Most of this will be object manipulation. Pictures are among the objects that can be manipulated, and illustrative commands are given in the above paragraph.\nIn connection with pictures, the LRP can make statements involving locations. Many people and objects in the pictures are in front of, behind, beside, near, and far from, other objects in the pictures. The LRP should include statements which simply indicate the location of the object or person: \"This man is in front of this tree.\" The LRP should also include statements regarding where things are happening: \"This man is working in front of this tree.\"\n4.2.2.1.8. More on possessors and possessions\nIn the previous paragraph, possessor was mentioned as one of the roles a noun can have. Another role is that of possession, as dog in the phrase John's dog. You need to learn to understand sentences in which the possessor is a pronoun, or pronoun-like (my dog, your dog, our dog, etc., covering the whole range of possibilities you find in that particular language), and sentences in which the possessor is a regular noun (the man's dog, the woman's cat, etc.).\nJust in case there are any differences in how they are expressed, include three types of possessions: kinship terms (my father, my wife, etc.), body part terms ( your hand, her face, etc.) and typical nouns (our book, your friend's dog, etc.)\nTechniques: You can easily learn to understand this type of expression using TPR: \"Point to Joe's Father\" (you can use Joe's family tree diagram), \"Touch her shoulder,\" \"Take my pencil,\" \"Put your green pencil in front of her.\" Your LRP can also use pictures for this; \"Where is the man's foot?\", \"Where is his hammer?\", etc.\n4.2.2.1.9. The manner of action\nActions are sometimes described with mention of how they are performed: quickly, slowly, sadly, happily, repeatedly, carefully, carelessly, accidentally, purposefully. Here's some more homework: add as many manner words to this list as you can think of.\nTechniques: TPR is commonly used to learn to understand manner words: \"Stand up quickly\", \"Sit down slowly\". When I use a picture book, I always like the LRP to tell me to turn the page when the time comes that she wants to go on to the next page. This can be combined with manner words: \"Turn the page carefully.\"\n4.2.2.2. Adding a little bit of muscle\nSuppose you have now learned to comprehend all the language patterns required to express the concepts I have discussed so far. For each pattern you will have heard, processed and responded to scores, if not hundreds, of sentences fitting the pattern. By now, the LRP can tell you about many or perhaps most situations or events, describing them as they occur, provided you know the appropriate vocabulary, and she can instruct you to perform many complex actions, again, assuming you have the vocabulary. This is a good start. Much of what you will learn from now on will be modifications of things you already know.\nAll this time you're advancing on two fronts. You are doing activities whose central purpose is to increase the number of vocabulary items you can recognize, especially nouns, verbs, and adjectives. You are also engaging in learning activities which will enable you to comprehend a basic range of sentence patterns. More and more, as we go along, it will be likely that some of the things we discuss will be things you have already learned. Then you can just check them off. Otherwise, one by one, you can work these things into your sessions with your LRP.\n4.2.2.2.1. Dealing with the past\nNow in connection with your pictures and other activities that required you to hear, process and respond, you will have learned to recognize a good stock of nouns (farmer) , verbs (ploughing) and adjectives ( wet). It may be that in the language you are learning, pictures are described in a form that you can think of as \"present tense\", as in \"This farmer is ploughing in a wet field\". You also want to start recognizing forms that describe things that happened in the past. The system for indicating such time-related properties of expressions will vary greatly from language to language. It may also be complex, if you worry about all the details. So it may not be a good idea to worry about all the details, or all the possible forms. Rather, at this point, you will concern yourself with the main uses of the main forms.\nTechniques: With your pictures, you may be able to get these past time sentence patterns by providing a frame, such as \"When this picture was taken--\". That is, with each picture, the LRP says things like \"When this picture was taken this farmer was ploughing a field.\" If you have a hundred pictures, you will quickly hear a hundred sentences with familiar verbs in this type of past description form. You may get another type of past description form by using the frame \"On the day when this picture was taken--\" or \"During the week when this picture was taken--\". In English, for example, this might yield \"During the week when this picture was taken, this man ploughed a field\". Can you see the difference in the verb form in these English examples? You may or may not find such a difference in another language.\nYou can also experience past description forms of sentences in the context of physical activities. For example, your co-learner might perform actions, and yourLRP will then tell you what your co-learner just did. Or it might be what you just did, or what the LRP just did, and so forth. In this way you may be able to combine past description forms with different pronouns, which may be interesting in its own right, and is essential to learn in any case.\n4.2.2.2.2. Talking about the future\nAn early practical need is to understand how people make commitments and predictions. \"I'll come visit you tomorrow\" is a commitment. \"My mother is coming tomorrow\" is a prediction.\nTechniques: If the LRP naturally describes your pictures in a present time form (\"This man is ploughing\"), then she may be able to make a statement about what the person will do next. If you are focusing on learning to comprehend the forms used to talk about the future, you might want to keep the other content of what the LRP says relatively simple. For example, you could simply use the verbs for sitting and standing. If a person is sitting, the LRP can tell you that the person will stand up. If the person is standing, the LRP can tell you that the person will sit down. Similarly you could use the verbs for working and resting. Or if you have already developed a large recognition vocabulary you could have your LRP simply make predictions about what the person or persons in the picture will do next (after they finish doing what they are doing in the picture): \"In this picture, this man is ploughing. Soon he will go home.\"\nYou can also learn to understand future time forms through TPR and object manipulation. Your LRP can tell you what she is going to do and then do it. Or she can tell you what your co-learner is going to do, and your co-learner fulfills the prediction. In similar ways, you can learn to understand future forms with a variety of pronouns.\n4.2.2.2.3. Making general statements about things that happen, or used to happen\nSome statements do not concern situations or events that are happening at the moment, or have happened in the past, or that are supposed to yet happen. Rather they deal with what characteristically happens. Examples in English are \"I shop at Piggly Wiggly\" and \"Dogs eat meat\". In the case of \"I shop at Piggly Wiggly\" we see the statement of a general fact about a single individual (me). In the case of \"Dogs eat meat\" we see a general fact about the general dog. We can also make general statements about things that happened characteristically at some time in the past. An example is \"I used to shop at Piggly Wiggly\".\nTechniques: Object manipulation: You might take a collection of objects and see what general statements your LRP can make about them. For instance, if you have a collection of objects each of which is bought at a different type of shop, your LRP can make statements such as \"People buy it at a book shop\", \"People buy it at a dry good shop\", \"People buy it at a tool shop\", and you respond by picking up the object you feel is being described. Or the LRP might make a statement about what she typically does with each object.\nPicture description: The LRP can make any general statement which is obviously applicable to the main character or other elements in a picture. If a woman is cooking, the LRP might say \"She cooks meals for her family\". You respond by indicating which picture is being referred to.\nIt may help to use a frame such as \"Every day--\" or \"From time to time--\". You can also use frames which will require a characteristic statement about the past: \"When this man was young--\"\n4.2.2.2.4. Time words\nTime words are words like today, this morning, tonight, tomorrow, and so forth. There may also be names for days of the week, for months, for seasons of the year, etc., and there may be words for telling time.\nTechniques: Time words can be combined with TPR commands. For example, you may make a paper clock with moveable hands. The LRP can tell you \"Go to sleep at 7:00\" and then gradually move the hands to 7:00 (at which point you mime going to sleep). Later she can ask \"What did you do at 7:00?\" and you can respond by going to sleep. Similarly she can say, \"Buy a banana on Tuesday,\" and then begin pointing one by one at a sequence of days on the calendar until she arrives at Tuesday, and you respond at that point by picking up a banana. If different foods are used at different times of the day, she can say something like \"We eat it in the morning,\" etc. You respond, for example by picking up the item.\n4.2.2.2.5. When you don't want to mention who did it\nSometimes a sentence is understood to have both an agent and a patient, but for some reason the agent is not important, and you only want to mention the patient. We have already seen an example in the frame \"When this picture was taken...\". The picture is the patient. Who is the agent that took the picture? The sentence doesn't tell us that. Such agentless sentences are often a special case of what are called passive sentences. They are probably the most typical kind of passive sentence. By getting some exposure to agentless sentences, you may get some exposure to passive sentences, which may be important to your comprehension ability as a basic speaker.\nTechniques: You can use TPR for this. Use several objects which make good patients. Paper is good. Think of all the things you can do with paper. Your LRP tells you to do different things to different pieces of paper. Now the LRP can describe the different pieces of paper in terms of what was done to each: \"It was folded,\" \"It was torn,\" \"It was wadded,\" \"It was cut,\" and each time, you indicate which piece of paper was being described. (It may help to restore the papers as nearly as possible to their original condition before the LRP begins saying what was done to them.)\n4.2.2.2.6. Asking questions about all this stuff\nYou have been hearing questions since your first session. For example, after the LRP said, \"This is a carrot\", and \"This is a banana\", she might have asked you \"Where is the carrot, and where is the banana?\". Many of the activities suggested so far will be most natural if the LRP uses questions. For example, in the previous paragraph, instead of saying \"We eat it in the morning\", it would probably be more natural for her to say \"What do we eat in the morning?\" Do not hesitate to have your LRP use questions whenever they make the communication more natural. Assuming you have been doing that, we now want to insure that you have covered the main bases in learning to comprehend questions. If I mention a type of question you have not learned to recognize, then you can tackle it by focusing on it in one of your language sessions.\nThere are two main types of questions. There are questions which can be answered with a simple yes or no, and there are questions which require that you give some specific information in order to answer them. These are called content questions. An example of an English yes/no question is \"Did I take three green bananas?\". English content questions are ones with words such as when, where, who, what, why, and how.\nAlthough questions came into play quite early in my discussion, and, presumably, in your language sessions, this is a good place to focus on them, since you now have a variety of notions that can be questioned. Think of your simple descriptions of objects and activities. They can be converted into yes/no questions (\"Is this a man?\" \"Is this man ploughing?\"). In order to force you to process what you hear, the LRP must ask questions which you can understand, and which could be answered with yes or no. For instance, if there is a picture of a man ploughing and a picture of a woman cooking in the same group of pictures, the LRP might ask you \"Is this man ploughing?\" or \"Is this woman cooking?\", but she could equally ask you \"Is this man cooking?\" or \"Is this woman ploughing?\"\nNow you learned to recognize sentences with agents and patients (or subjects and objects). Both of them can be questioned. To question the agent, the LRP would ask \"Who is cooking the rice?\". To question the patient, the LRP would ask \"What is this woman cooking?\". So if you look back at all of the roles that nouns can have in sentences, they will suggest types of questions. Indirectobject: \"Who did I give it to?\" Location: \"Where is the man?\" or \"Where is the man working?\" The thing that was used: \"What is she writing with?\" The beneficiary: \"Who is she cooking for?\" The associate: \"Who is he working with?\" The source of movement: \"Where is he coming from?\" The goal of movement: \"Where is she going to?\" And the possessor: \"Whose hand is this?\". Questions can also be asked about the manner: \"How is she cooking?\" And the reason: \"Why is she cooking?\". Questions can be asked about things in the past, present, or future.\nDo you see how everything we have covered so far feeds into questions? If in your record keeping you are keeping track of all the types of sentence patterns that you have learned to comprehend, based on my suggestions in this section, then you can go over them and see whether you think you already know how questions are formed which deal with all of the other patterns and concepts you have so far covered in your sessions.\nTechniques: A technique that I have not mentioned so far is simple verbal response. Early on, it may be better to simply respond in English or another language that you already speak fluently. Saying \"yes\" or \"no\" in the new language may seem like a simple matter, but I personally find that it slows my learning, since it interferes with my ability to concentrate on what I am trying to comprehend.\nQuestions can be asked in connection with pictures or with actions that take place in the language session. Using questions increases your flexibility in learning other things. For example, if you are learning to understand statements about future time, the LRP can vary the time component of questions. Suppose there is a picture of a standing man. Then \"Did this man stand up?\" gets the answer \"yes\", but \"Is this man going to stand up?\" gets the answer \"no\".\n4.2.2.2.7. Possible, likely or at least desirable, or maybe even necessary\nThings may be possible in the sense that they are not impossible, or they may be possible in the sense that I don't know whether or not they are true. In simple communication, you do not commonly need to talk about the first kind of possibility (\"It could rain on my birthday\"). The second kind of possibility (\"It could be raining outside\") is very frequently needed in basic communication. That is, you need to be able to express uncertainty. There may be different degrees of uncertainty. Compare \"He might come tonight\" with \"He'll probably come tonight\". A concept related to possibility is ability. What I am able to do is possible for me, and what I am unable to do is impossible for me.\nAs with everything else we have considered, there is no reason to expect that the language you are learning will be at all like English in the way that it expresses these meanings. I cannot go into all of the possibilities. One that is worth noting is important because it would take us into a new realm. So far we have mainly been concerned with sentences that consist of a single clause. You may find that these meanings require two clauses. This happens in English in some cases: \"It is likely that I will come\". Here the two clauses are \"It is likely\" and \"that I will come\". Notice how each is like a sentence in its own right. We'll deal below with many types of sentences that have more than one clause.\nSome languages put a lot of emphasis on degrees of certainty. They may distinguish between information which the speaker got from hearsay or directly observed. There may be several degrees of certainty that come into play, even in simple sentences.\nFor saying that something is desirable, a language may employ sentences with more than one clause, as in \"It would be good if you left.\" However, notice that in English, we can say \"You should leave.\" Likewise, in saying that something is necessary, a language may employ sentences with more than one clause, as in \"He has to leave.\" (Here the clause to leave is so chopped down that it may not seem like a clause to you.). But it may also be possible to express such a meaning within a single clause, as in \"He must leave\".\nTechniques: Use your pictures. Give your LRP some examples in English (or whatever language you are mainly using) of sentences which express possibility or likelihood. For example, if you have a picture of a restaurant, you might say, \"Someone is probably eating in here.\" If a man is walking by the restaurant, you could say, \"This man might go into the restaurant\". Some examples will naturally involve a higher degree of likelihood than others. Your LRP can go through all of the pictures and make such statements. You can respond by pointing to the picture or situation she is referring to. Your LRP can use forms which carry the meaning of ability by looking around and asking you about things you are and are not able to do. Are you able to lift the fridge? Are you able to open the fridge?\nTo help you to learn to comprehend simple statements of desirability, such as \"You should wrap the cloth around the fruit,\" your LRP may be able to use these statements in place of command forms in TPR activities. You can combine the forms meaning \"should\" and forms meaning \"must\" in a single activity. If the LRP says you should do it, you may start to do it, hesitate, and then either do it or not do it. If she says you must do it, you quickly do it.\nIn connection with pictures, the LRP should be able to think of fairly simple statements of what people in the pictures should do or must do.\n4.2.2.2.8. Denying and forbidding\nAll of the types of statements you can now understand can be negated. I'm sure that by this point you'll have already run into negation, but I mention it here for the sake of completeness. The negation of \"This is a man\" is \"This is not a man.\" There are also negative commands and instructions. \"Don't sit down\" is the negative counterpart of \"Sit down\".\nTechniques: Think of the example above of learning the names of rooms in the house using a sketch of the floor plan. Suppose the LRP says \"Where is the verandah?\" and you point to the entrance way by mistake. The LRP can naturally correct you in the language by saying \"No. That is not the verandah. That is the entry way. This is the verandah.\" Likewise, if during TPR the LRP says \"Turn to the right\" and you turned to the left by mistake, then she can gently correct you, \"No. Don't turn to the right. Turn to the left.\" If the LRP frequently makes such natural comments in negative forms, you will easily learn to comprehend negative sentences.\n4.2.2.2.9. Starting, stopping, becoming, continuing and remaining\nExpressions related to the beginning or ending of an event or of a state of affairs may employ simple sentences or sentences with two clauses. Some examples are \"I began eating\", \"I started to eat\", \"I stopped eating\", and \"This became dirty\". Related notions are \"I finished eating\", \"I already ate\", and \"I continued eating\".\nTechniques: In TPR the LRP can tell you to start or stop various actions (\"Start running\", \"Keep running\", \"Stop running\", \"Start writing your name\", \"Stop writing\", \"Finish writing your name\"), and perhaps she can tell you to come into various states (\"Become happy\"). Picture descriptions can also employ these notions.\n4.2.3. Expressing deeper thoughts-adding a lot of muscle\nSo far we have dealt almost entirely with simple sentences. By simple sentences, I mean sentences with only one clause. If you've forgotten, a clause is a sort of mini-sentence. The following sentences have only one clause each:\n-- Please pass the salt.\n-- The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nBy contrast, the following sentences have two clauses:\n-- He came after I left.\n-- Whenever it rains, I stay home from work.\nSometimes one of the two mini-sentences is chopped down or simplified in some way, as in the following:\n-- Entering the yard, I looked through the window.\n-- I told her that in order to escape.\nOther times the mini-sentences that make up the bigger sentence cannot be clearly separated because one of them is inside the other:\n-- The man who I told you about is at the door.\nHere the two mini-sentences are The man... is at the door, and who I tolyou about.\nFrom here on we will be mainly interested in such sentence patterns containing two or more clauses.\n4.2.3.1. Stringing sentences together\nBoth instructions and statements can be strung together in chains. A language may have more than one way of doing this. For instance, in English, it would be natural to say \"This man left his house, hitched up his oxen, went to the field, and began ploughing.\" (Remember, we have among our hundred pictures one picture of a man ploughing a field with oxen.) However, we could also say \"Leaving his house, hitching up his oxen, and going to the field, this man began ploughing\". At this point you want to concern yourself with learning to comprehend sentence chains of the type that are most common in the language you are using. The language may be very different from English in this area as in any.\nThere may be an important distinction between chains in which all of the sentences have the same subject and chains in which the subject of each sentence is different. The sentence chain \"This man left his house, hitched up his oxen, went to the field, and began ploughing\" has the same subject for all the sentences in the chain. It is \"this man\" who left the house, it is the same man who harnessed his ox, it is the same man who went to the field, and the same man who began ploughing. Contrast the sentence \"My mother works at the bank, my father works at the factory, and my older brother attends university.\" Here there are three chained sentences, and three subjects: my mother, my father, and my older brother. In your language sessions you will want to be sure that you get exposure to both of these kinds of sentence chains, in case there is an important difference.\nTechniques: The example of the man ploughing was chosen to suggest ways the LRP might string sentences together in describing pictures. Your goal could be to attempt to identify the picture at the earliest possible moment in the chain. It is also a simple matter for the LRP to give you strings of commands. During your first week this would not be a good idea. Once you are a few weeks down the road, single commands may not be very challenging, and you'll appreciate the challenge of having a long string of commands to remember and carry out: \"Go into the yard, get a brick, bring it back and put it on the table.\"\n4.2.3.2. The person who I did it to was not the person who did it to me\nI gave the sentence \"The man who I told you about is at the door\" as an example of a mini-sentence (\"who I told you about\") nested inside another sentence (\"The man... is at the door\"). The clause who I told you about contributes to the description of the man. Commonly it is said that such a clause \"modifies the noun\". In other words who I told you about modifies the noun man. Clauses that modify nouns are called relative clauses. There are other kinds of clauses that modify nouns, and some languages may use them in situations where English uses a relative clause. As with all of the particular notions I have been discussing in these suggestions, I am not really focusing on the grammar and how it works, but rather on the notions that are being expressed. In any language there will be some way to express the notions that are expressed by relative clauses in English. I will go ahead and use the term \"relative clause\" for any expression which functions like an English relative clause.\nIn my experience, relative clauses are one of the most important language devices for increasing my flexibility in speaking a language. Nouns are very general. An expression like \"the man\" can refer to any of billions of male adults. Yet every person is different, and when I talk about a man, I need a way to tell you which man I am talking about. That is where relative clauses come in. If I say \"the man who lives directly in back of me\", I am able to refer to one very specific man. For the most part, people talk about very specific things, like the man who lives directly behind me.\nIt is possible that your LRP will already have been using relative clauses in order to make the communication more natural during your learning activities. For example, recall when I discussed learning to understand general statements by using a collection of objects which are bought at different shops. The LRP would say \"We buy it at the meat shop,\" and you would point to the meat. It might be more natural for her to say \"Pick up something which we buy at the meat shop,\" using the relative clause \"which we buy at the meat shop.\" Thus you may have had a lot of exposure to relative clauses by the time you get around to focusing on them in a language session. As in the case of questions, I want to help you to determine whether you have learned to comprehend the main types of relative clauses. If I mention a type of relative clause that you have not yet had exposure to, you can then plan to focus on it in a language session.\nWhat I am about to say may seem a bit complicated. If you find it confusing, you can wait and come back to it when you think you need it. You should still be able to understand what I have to say here with regard to techniques.\nThere are three or four main types of relative clauses you will want to concern yourself with at this point. To classify a relative clause, first identify the noun that it is modifying. Consider the case of the duck which I shot. What is the noun which is being modified? It is the duck. Now ask yourself, what role is the duck understood to have in the relative clause? Note I say understood to have. The duck is not actually in the relative clause. The relative clause is simply which I shot. But the duck is understood to have a role in the relative clause. It is understood as the thing that got shot; that is, it is understood as the patient (or object) of the relative clause, even though it is not mentioned there. Because it is understood as the object, this relative clause is called an object relative clause. Now you make up a sentence in which the relative clause is understood as the subject of the relative clause.\nDO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT MAKING UP A RELATIVE CLAUSE IN WHICH THE NOUN WHICH IS MODIFIED BY THE RELATIVE CLAUSE IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE SUBJECT OF THE RELATIVE CLAUSE.\nHow did you do? Here is an example: The man who shot the duck. The noun modified? Man. Look at the clause who shot the duck, and ask yourself what role the man has in that clause. The man is the one who does the shooting, that is, the agent, or subject. Thus the man who shot the duck is a subject relative clause. You might consider two types of subject relative clauses. The first type occurs when there is no object in the subject relative clause, as in the man who yawned (if you are interested, you can call this an intransitive subject relative clause). The second type occurs when there is an object in the subject relative clause, as in the man who shot the duck, where the duck is the object.\nIn addition to subject relative clauses and object relative clauses, you will want to be exposed to relative clauses such as the gun with which I shot it, the woman for whom I made it, the kids with whom I played, the house where I live. The main point here is that the nouns gun, woman, kids, and house are not understood as the subject in the clauses with which I shot it, for whom I made it, with whom I played and where I live, nor are those nouns understood as the objects in those clauses. Rather, they have other roles, such as being the instrument used, or the location, or whatever.\nIt will be helpful if you keep these four types of relative clauses in mind--object relative clauses, two types of subject relative clause, and relative clauses which are neither object relative clause nor subject relative clauses. The reason I recommend you keep them all in mind, is that different languages may handle the different types in different ways.\nNow in case you were wondering, this discussion of relative clauses has been the most demanding thing I have bothered you with. If your background in linguistics is weak or lacking, you may need to think it through very carefully. It may turn out that relative clauses are simpland straightforward in the language you are learning. If not, what I have just said may help you to sort things out better.\nTechniques: I hope you haven't lost sight of the fact that your main goal right now is to learn to understand sentences which employ the basic sentence patterns of the language. If relative clauses are simple and straightforward, they will be a snap to learn to understand. Even if they are somewhat complicated, it shouldn't be too hard to learn to understand them when you hear them.\nFor learning to understand relative clauses you can use TPR, object manipulation and picture description. A typical instruction for learning to understand relative clauses by TPR would be \"Give three eggs to the woman who is seated\". If you have co-learners, especially, it may be possible for the LRP to describe any of them by means of a variety of relative clauses, using vocabulary you already know or are learning during that session. Pictures are especially helpful in covering the four different types of relative clauses. After you give the LRP a few examples in English, or whatever language you share with her, she can go through a hundred pictures using only subject relative clauses and go through the same pictures using only object relative clauses. She can use the same hundred for other relative clauses. For subject relative clauses she might say things like \"Here is a man who is ploughing\" or \"Where is the man who is ploughing?\" For object relative clauses she might say things like \"Where is the ball which the boy is kicking?\" For other types of relative clauses, sentences might focus on, say, locations: \"Where is the tree which someone is standing under?\"\n4.2.3.3. If this, then that\nWhew! We're done with relative clauses. They're so helpful to the language learner, but a bit complicated to think about. Fortunately, in many languages they are not very complicated to learn. The rest of the types of sentences I discuss are much easier to discuss, though any of them could turn out to be complicated in a particular language.\nExpressions of the form \"If I come to town, then I will visit you\" are another type of expression which you need to be able to understand, and, eventually, to speak, in order to be a basic speaker of the language. There are at least three important types of \"if-then\" sentences. In one type, the if-clause is understood to pertain to the future: \"If I come to town [future], then I will visit you.\" This is probably the most useful type, and it may be enough for you as a basic speaker. A second type has the if-clause pertaining to the present state of affairs: \"If he is not at work today, he may be sick\". The third type relates to hypothetical states of affairs which are not the way things are in reality: \"If he were here, he could tell us.\"\nTechniques: To learn to comprehend if-clauses which pertain to the present state of affairs, you may be able to combine them with commands, and use TPR: \"If I am holding something which we eat, take it from me and put it into your mouth.\" Future oriented if-then sentences can also be combined with commands in many cases. The LRP first says, \"If I fold the cloth, bend the pipe.\" She then performs various actions, but at some random point she folds the cloth, and that is the point at which you respond by bending the pipe.\nYou can use pictures to cover the contrary-to-fact variety of if-then sentence. The LRP can look at each picture and imagine what the results would be if the person in the picture had not done whatever s/he is doing: \"If this man had not ploughed his field, he could not have planted his corn.\" Actually, an assortment of these contrary-to-fact sentences can be used with pictures. \"If this man were short, he would not be able to reach that apple\", \"If this man had ploughed my field, I could have rested.\"\n4.2.3.4. When things happen, other things happen\nYou may have already been exposed to the type of sentence I have in mind here. Recall that in connection with learning to talk about events and situations in the past, I suggested that the LRP use frames, such as \"When this picture was taken--\" This type of clause, sometimes called a temporal clause, or time clause, provides the temporal setting in which an event occurs.\nTemporal clauses can be past oriented (\"When I was eating my breakfast--\") or future oriented (\"When I eat supper--\"). Related notions include \"Before I ate supper--\", \"Until I ate supper--\", and \"After I ate supper--.\"\nTechniques: After you give a few examples, the LRP should be able to think of a reasonable sentence to say in connection with each picture, using a past oriented temporal clause: \"When this man was ploughing, he walked behind his plough\". Future oriented temporal clauses are similar to if-clauses discussed above, and similar techniques can be used. \"When I fold the cloth, bend the pipe.\" \"Keep writing until I smile.\"\n4.2.3.5. Just because, or even in spite of, or perhaps in order to\nOften two clauses are combined in such a way that one clause gives the reason for the other: \"I smiled at him because he looked funny.\" Here the second clause, \"...because he looked funny,\" is the reason, and the first clause, \"I smiled at him,\" is the result. Alternatively, I could say, \"He looked funny, and so I smiled at him,\" in such a case the reason (\"he looked funny\") comes before the result (\"so I smiled at him\").\nClosely related to reason clauses, are purpose clauses. An example of purpose clauses in English are those that begin with \"in order to--\" or some that begin with \"so that--\": \"I bought some meat in order to make stew\"; \"I bought some meat so that I could make stew\".\nSometimes there are reasons not to do things, but we do them anyway. In English we often express this meaning by clauses beginning with \"Even though--\", as in \"Even though I was angry, I didn't say anything.\"\nTechniques: Pictures are the most helpful tool here. In connection with every picture, your LRP should be able to think of a reason or purpose for which the actor is performing the action. You will give several examples in English, or whatever language you share with your LRP, to get things rolling. You can do the same thing with sentences which express the idea of \"even though X, nevertheless Y.\" \"Even though this man is tired, nevertheless, he is still working.\"\n4.2.3.6. He made me do it\nSome sentences have a primary agent and a secondary agent. \"John made Bill eat the sandwich.\" Bill is the agent who eats the patient. But John is the agent who made the decision to have the patient get eaten, and who acted on that decision so as to get the patient eaten! John could have been less demanding, in which case we might say \"John told Bill to eat the sandwich,\" or even \"John asked Bill to eat the sandwich,\" which is the least demanding of all. Or John might have been even more demanding, in the face of Bill's resistance, in which case we might say \"John forced Bill to eat the sandwich.\"\nTechniques: TPR is the best technique here. You need a co-learner, or at least a willing volunteer, and then your LRP can have you make that person do things. You can decide how you want to distinguish between the extremes of merely asking your friend to do the action and forcing him or her to do it.\n4.2.3.7. Making comparisons\nLanguages use a variety of means of indicating that one item is bigger, darker, longer, nicer, etc. than another item, or that one person runs faster than another, or is smarter than another. I haven't, in general, been discussing the variety of ways in which languages may express particular meanings, because it would be hopeless to cover even a fraction of the possibilities. I would like to take this opportunity to point out to you how important it is to let the language be itself. You may be interpreting things through an English filter, and you want to avoid that. So let's suppose that you have two ropes, both of which are very long, by local standards, but one is slightly longer than the other. You ask your LRP to tell you \"This rope is longer than this one.\" What she says is perfectly clear to you. You hear her say, in her language, \"This rope is not long, and thisrope is long.\" You become frustrated. You tell her, \"No. You misunderstood me. You can't say 'this rope is not long,' because it is long. It just isn't as long as the other rope.\" You just goofed. You filtered the new language through your English grid. It just so happens that in that particular language, to say that one rope is longer than the other you do indeed say something which literally sounds like \"This rope is not long and this is long.\"\nTechniques: Each time I suggest a technique for learning to understand a particular sentence pattern, I tend to use simple examples which illustrate that sentence pattern and little else. As we have gone along, this has become increasingly misleading. By now your LRP has considerable flexibility, since you can understand all sorts of complex sentences combining many of the notions I have discussed. So for once, I'll exemplify a pattern by embedding it in a complex sentence. Where is the comparison in the following? \"Give your friend a book which is heavier than the one I am holding.\" You need to be encouraging the LRP to use more and more complex sentences as you go along. She will have a sense for what you can understand and can try to use increasingly natural sentences to communicate with you as time goes on.\n4.2.3.8. Things I thought, or said or at least wished, and maybe even tried\nThere is one last type of sentence pattern involving sentences with two clauses which is essential for you if you are to be a basic speaker. These are sentences with verbs such as \"say\", \" think\", \"believe\", \"desire\", \"want\", \"wish\", \"know\", etc. as in the following English examples:\n-- This man said, \"Bring me my oxen.\"\n-- This man says, \"I am ploughing.\"\n-- This man says that he is ploughing.\n-- This man is thinking, \"I am tired.\"\n-- This man thinks that his field is large.\n-- This man wants to rest.\n-- This man is trying to rest.\n-- This man wishes he could rest.\n-- This man knows how to plough.\n-- This man knows that his oxen are tired.\nIn these examples, the underlined portion is a mini-sentence within the larger sentence. Notice that in some cases the mini-sentence is in quotation marks. This is referred to as direct discourse. The other mini-sentences, the ones not in quotation marks, are examples of indirect discourse. There is a lot that I could say about what distinguishes direct from indirect discourse. Suffice it to say that you may find that another language uses indirect discourse where English uses direct discourse, or vice versa.\nTechniques: You can use the pictures you have been using all along, or you might want to get some new pictures that have a lot going on in them, such as those in the children's Waldo series. The LRP will choose a person or animal in the picture and tell you what that animal or person is thinking or saying. For example, she might say \"Before this picture was taken, this man said, 'I have a big field to plough',\" or perhaps, \"This man is thinking that it might rain and he will have to go home,\" or possibly \"This man knows that he has a lot of work to do.\" Your job is to point at the man who would have made such a statement or thought such a thought.\nThe example \"This man is trying to rest\" is a bit different from the others, but an important thing to be able to understand and, quite soon, to use in speech. The LRP can use TPR for this, instructing you to try to do things that are actually not possible (\"Try to pick up the fridge\").\n4.3. Suggestions for covering a basic range of language functions and communication situations\nI have given you many suggestions for covering a range of vocabulary and sentence patterns. These are your bricks and mortar. Without vocabulary and sentence patterns it is impossible to do anything in a language. I have tried to focus you on essential, central ones which you will need in order to be a basic speaker of the language.\nFairly early you will also want to start thinking in terms of the functions for which you will use the language and the situations in which you will be using the language. I have suggested that you can include such considerations in your plans for your sessions even while you are concentrating entirely, or almost entirely, on learning to understand the language. You become increasingly concerned with functions and situations in which you will be using the language as you work increasingly on speaking it conversationally during your language sessions, say, during the second month.\nDuring the first few weeks, when the focus was mainly on learning to comprehend, you focused on language functions when you had your LRP use different politeness formulas in giving you commands, requests or instructions. For example, suppose you were learning English. During one of your first sessions the LRP may use a simple command form for TPR such as \"Stand up, sit down.\" Later on you may wish to learn the forms that are used in real life for making a request of a socially higher person, such as your employer. Then instead of \"Stand up, sit down,\" the LRP might say \"Could I get you to stand up? Would you mind sitting down?\" On another day the LRP may act as though you are socially lower. You might pretend that she is your mother and you are her child (whatever roles you pretend, you will try to keep them in mind all through the activity). In that case, she might use the simple command forms. In some languages, there may be less emphasis on relative social standing. In other languages there may be considerably more emphasis, not just in connection with commands and requests, but, possibly in connection with every single sentence!\nKeeping in mind such social factors, here is a list of language functions which you might attempt to include in your sessions in order to become a basic speaker of the language:\n-- requesting a object\n-- complying with a request for an object\n-- refusing to comply with a request for an object\n-- requesting an action\n-- complying with or refusing to comply with such requests\n-- requesting assistance (asking a favour)\n-- complying with or declining such a request\n-- offering an object\n"}, {"score": 1284.4016, "uuid": "d2868bab-e0a4-5c14-a95d-6b6549a92721", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-51-11005", "target_hostname": "www.aadl.org", "target_uri": "http://www.aadl.org/research/sites/foreign_languages", "page_rank": 1.2712863e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Foreign</em> <em>Languages</em> | Ann Arbor District Library", "snippet": "There are now books on CD (<em>or</em> BOCDs) in different <em>languages</em> available <em>at</em> the Downtown Library in both Youth and <em>Adult</em>.

While language learning is an enriching experience for all ages, children have the most to gain from this wonderful adventure. Quite simply, starting early offers the widest possible set of benefits and opportunities.\nChildren understand intuitively that language is something to explore, to play around with, and to enjoy. Their enthusiasm is both infectious and effective. The quickness with which they pick up their first language is nearly miraculous\u2014and such a joy to watch as a parent. As children grow, all parents can attest to how much fun their children continue to have as they sing new words they hear and even invent new ones with a huge, bright smile. The joy with which children explore their first language makes childhood the ideal time for a second language\u2014even if all the other reasons for an early start didn't exist!\nBut there are many other reasons, and while this list does not exhaust the number and variety of advantages starting a language early can provide, these are some of the most notable benefits.\nHigher test scores: Numerous reports have proven that students who have studied a foreign language perform much better than their monolingual peers on many standardized tests, including all sections of the SAT. In fact, the 2007 College Bound Seniors report, issued by the College Board, which administers the SAT, vividly demonstrates the significant benefits of studying a foreign language. The report shows that students with 4 or more years of foreign language study score on average 140 points higher (out of 800!) than students with half a year or less experience on the Critical Reading section, and almost another 140 in the Math section and over 150 points higher on Writing.\nBetter and more advanced reading skills: A study undertaken by York University in Canada suggests that bilingual children\u2019s knowledge of a second language gives them an advantage in learning to read. Their ability to apply the insights and experiences of one language to the other as well as their wider experience of language gives them a big leg up. As they grow older, this advantage continues and grows. Plus, being able to read two languages is pretty impressive all by itself!\nGreater confidence: Children are always discovering new things, but learning a new language is a uniquely rewarding experience\u2014at any age. For children, the feeling of accomplishment that comes with their first steps toward a second language can spur them on to a deeper and broader passion for learning in general. And because children are at a special \"window of opportunity\" in which language learning is intuitive and natural, the ease and pleasure of the experience may boost their confidence and their desire for new discoveries.\nGives brains a boost: In a recent article in The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell quotes James Flynn, a renowned scientist, as saying \"The mind is much more like a muscle than we've ever realized\u0085 It needs to get cognitive exercise. It's not some piece of clay on which you put an indelible mark.\" Research into the effects of bilingualism on children suggests that exposure to more than one language is an excellent way of flexing those brain muscles\u2014and building them up too! Bilingual children in one study reported in Nature showed a significantly larger density of \"grey matter\" in their brains. And those who had been exposed to a second language from an early age proved to have the most grey matter of all. Grey matter is responsible for processing information, including memory, speech and sensory perception. And if it can be increased by exposure to a second language, then language learning would be just like taking your brain to the gym!\nNatural-sounding, native-like accent: Children are always mimicking what they hear, and are surprisingly good at it! They are uniquely attuned to slight differences in tone and sound. Their sensitive ears help them pick up on and duplicate the tricky sounds adults and even adolescents often stumble over. For adults just beginning a new language, this difficulty can be discouraging\u2014trying to speak Spanish like Antonio Banderas from Evita only to end up sounding like Jack Black in Nacho Libre isn't exactly the best language experience. A study conducted by researchers from UCLA and the University of Hong Kong, however, shows that even adults with significant exposure to a language in childhood can end up speaking like a native. By starting early, your children can speak smoothly and confidently from the first.\nGreater opportunities for college and careers: Colleges now place an increasingly high value on knowledge of more than one language. As the admissions process becomes more competitive across the board, knowing a second or a third language adds a new dimension to an applicant's resume. And as the economy becomes more and more globalized, English-only becomes less and less of an option.\nBigger view of the world: Traveling abroad is an experience which can benefit anyone, offering not just new sites to see, but new frames of mind and new perspectives. But going abroad and feeling comfortable in the language of your destination means you're doing more than just traveling\u2014going from your home to another place, and then back home. You can feel as if you're a part of the culture and the life of this new world, as if you aren't a total stranger just visiting. Like reading a poem in another tongue you know, you will hear more than just the language\u2014you will hear the music behind it as well, and the life.\nGreater grasp of one's first language\u2014including a bigger, richer vocabulary: Most of the time we use our first language with little thought to grammatical rules or constructions. This is perfectly natural, but the experience of learning a new language can bring greater understanding and perhaps even better grammar to our first language. Knowing the way another language works encourages us to examine our own language's mechanics in a positive way. By being able to compare the two, we learn more than we ever would as a monolingual. Or as Nancy Rhodes, Director of Foreign Language Education at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, DC says, \"The more children learn about a foreign language, the more they understand about their own language.\" Children use what they learn in one language to reinforce concepts and terms they've learned in the other. They can solidify their gains in their native tongue by matching them to their new adventures in another language.\nBuilding and keeping cultural connections: Some of us are lucky enough to have a relative who still speaks their mother tongue frequently. To be able to communicate with them in that language builds a bridge\u2014not only to that person, but to the heritage and history they represent. To maintain that connection keeps alive so much\u2014memories, stories and traditions\u2014and brings to life new memories, stories and traditions as well.\nAn all-family activity: Modern life is hectic; its demands are frequent and often contradictory. Learning a language together as a family provides a unifying activity which doesn't require you to drive your kids anywhere, and doesn't make it necessary to be in ten places at once. Starting this process early with your child or children provides your family with an activity and an experience it can return to and grow with over the years.\nYour child and your family will benefit\u2014in these ways and others\u2014from learning a second language. You will find new and even unique uses, opportunities and ideas open up as you adapt your language learning process to your and your child's needs and aspirations. Starting now means the possibilities are wide open!\n"}, {"score": 1280.0093, "uuid": "7bae4c59-0448-5c6e-8391-c5f558c046c6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-59-07190", "target_hostname": "www.newharbinger.com", "target_uri": "http://www.newharbinger.com/ForeignEditionsbyLanguage/tabid/309/Default.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1735285e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Foreign</em> Editions by <em>Language</em>", "snippet": "He Depressed <em>or</em> What?", "explanation": null, "document": "Kid Cooperation, 1997, International Ideas Home, Riyadh,\nKid Cooperation, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\nSelf-Esteem, 3rd Edition, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\nBoy Talk, 3rd Edition, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\nPower of Focusing, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\nRelaxation Workbook, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\nMemory Workbook, 2004, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh,\n50 Great Tips\u2026 to Connect With Your Teen, Anglo-Egyptian Booksho, Cairo\n10 Simple Solutions to Migraines, 2006, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions to Adult ADD, 2006, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions to Shyness, 2006, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions to Worry, 2006, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions to Panic, 2006, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\nWomen Who Worry Too Much, 2007, Dar Al Kitab Arabi, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions to Stress, 2007, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\n10 Simple Solutions for Building Self-Esteem, 2007, Dar Al Kitab Al Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon\nTransforming Stress, 2008, Obeikan Reseach & Sev., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nTransforming Depression, 2008,\u00a0 Obeikan Reseach & Sev., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nIt's So Hard To Love You, 2008, Obeikan Reseach & Sev., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nFive Good Minutes, 2008, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nFive Good Minutes in the Evening, 2008, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nFive Good Minutes at Work, 2008, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nFive Good Minutes with the One You Love, 2008, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nTalk to Me, 2008, Jarir Bookstore, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nFive Good Minutes In Your Body, 2009, Jarir Bookstore, Saudi Arabia\nMessages, 2009,\u00a0 Jarir Bookstore, Saudi Arabia\nThoughts & Feelings, 3rd Edition, 2009,\u00a0 Jarir Bookstore\nTrigger Point Therapy Workbook, Second Edition, Jarir Bookstore\nBULGARIAN\nAnxiety & Phobia Workbook, 2008, LIK Publishing House, Sofia, Bulgaria\nMessages, 2nd Edition, 2008, \u00a0LIK Publishing House, Sofia, Bulgaria\nSelf-Esteem,3rd Ed., 2008, LIK Publishing House, Sofia, Bulgaria\nCHINESE\nThe Relaxation & Stress Reduction Workbook, 1st Ed., 1993, Harvard Mgt, Taipei, Taiwan\nCouple Skills 1994, 1994, Ivy Publications, Taiwan\nThe Marriage Bed, 1995, Ivy Publications, Taiwan\nHot Water Therapy, 1995, Lee Bao Publishing Company, Taipei, Taiwan\nGetting To Sleep, 1995, Lee Bao Publishing Company, Taipei, Taiwan\nAngry All The Time, 1995,, 1995, Lee Bao Publishing Company, Taipei, Taiwan\nPrisoners of Belief, 1995, Yale Publishing, Taipei, Taiwan\nSelf-Esteem, 2nd Edition, 1995, Shy Mau Publishing, Hsien, Taiwan\nThueson's Guide To OTC Drugs, 1995, SuSHin, Taiwan\nI'd Rather Be Married, 1995, Lin Yu Cultural Enterprise, Taiwan\nBelonging, 1995, Sharpe Pointe, Taiwan\nResolving Conflict, 1996, Laureat Publishing, Taiwan\nThe Tao of Conversation, 1996, Boy Young Press Inc, Taipei, Taiwan\nCoping With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, 1996, Tricom Publication, Taiwan\nThe Three Minute Meditator, 1997, Dar Tsun Culture Pub.Co, Taiwan\nWhy Children Misbehave, 1998, New Sprouts Publishers, Taiwan\nThe Daily Relaxer , 1998, Sea Dove Publishing Company Ltd, Taiwan\nThe Power of Two, 1999, Living Psychology Publishers, Taiwan\nWhen Anger Hurts Your Kids, 1999, New Inspiring Publishing Co., Taiwan\nThe Worry Control Workbook, 1999, Wellness Book House,\nChildren Changed by Trauma, 2000, Wu Nan Book Co.

Click here for word counts and levels for the stories.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Liana On April 9, 2011 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00b7 In About Myself , Japanese Language Learning Resources\nI made another trip to the library recently, and I was faced with a daunting realization: I\u2019m running out of the level 3 and 4 books that I like. At the rate I\u2019m going they\u2019ll start getting harder soon; I can certainly read harder books, but not as quickly or fluidly as I\u2019d like\u2026\nWhen we moved from Michigan to Washington State, we didn\u2019t initially have a very clear picture of where we would settle down. Seattle? Tacoma? Olympia? Bremerton? Bellingham? I admit it: \u201cquality of the library system\u201d was an important criteria for evaluating potential places to live \u2014 would you believe I had a dream that we moved somewhere with no interlibrary loan system \u2014 and I scoped out several different libraries even before we moved. (Later, when looking for apartments, \u201cproximity to library\u201d was another important qualification.)\nOf course, I was most impressed with the Seattle library system\u2019s Japanese language selection. We ended up moving to Tacoma, but it\u2019s been in the back of my mind ever since that a Seattle library card could be mine for around $80. After all, there are more than 600 Japanese children\u2019s books spread out between the various branches \u2014 that puts the 125 children\u2019s books held at the Tacoma library main branch (no direct link, but you can search for JAJ) to shame. I just love any excuse to take the train up to Seattle, so getting there every so often wouldn\u2019t be a problem\u2026 I was going back to look at exactly how much a prized Seattle library card would set me back ($85 per year, incidentally) and I saw something that hadn\u2019t registered when I looked at that same page back when I lived in Ann Arbor: the Seattle public library has reciprocal arrangements with various other libraries in the area. Tacoma\u2019s not one of them, but Pierce County is, and as it so happens, Tacoma and Pierce County have their own reciprocal system, where someone living in Tacoma can get a Pierce County card and vice versa.\nSo the question was this: are library cards transitive? I\u2019ve never before in my life felt the need to have three separate library cards, but that was before I started running out of appropriate books. The day I suspected that this might be possible, I went out and got a Pierce County card \u2014 just in case. As it turns out, even though I\u2019m from Tacoma, that Pierce County card and a valid picture ID with my current address qualified me for a Seattle library card after all! I called ahead to ask, then took the train up to Seattle the very next day. I returned home with 26 books\u266a I had been to the main library before and had been duly impressed by the rows of Japanese children\u2019s books, but I didn\u2019t truly appreciate their value until I started extensive reading and had to start looking not just for any old book, but for books at a certain level.\nIf you happen to be in Washington State, take a moment to see if you qualify for a Seattle library card . For an extensive reader, it\u2019s worth the trip. If not, are there any major libraries \u2014 public or part of a university or college \u2014 in your area with some Japanese books that you might be able to get access to? Hopefully, this may be a possible path to gathering more resources for other extensive readers as well.\nIncidentally, the Pierce County library system has enough Japanese books to have made it worthwhile for me to pick up a library card in its own right. My parents live in Pierce County, and when we stayed with them for two weeks after moving while figuring out where we wanted to live, I borrowed my dad\u2019s card to check out a couple of books. (He handed it over, and then, with some embarrassment, handed over a $20 to pay his fine. So that\u2019s where I get it from, I thought. It hasn\u2019t escaped my notice that getting books from three different libraries opens me up to three times the potential library fines\u2026) Actually, a shiny new library in University Place, which is part of the Pierce County system and about 20 minutes away from me, opened in February. Had it been open when we moved to Washington, that might have bumped University Place up a few notches in my potential destination calculations!\nBy the way, the reason I divide my book reviews not just by level, but by library, is that I hope to be extra useful to other readers in the area and perhaps even to put together an extensive reading group at some point. I should have started that already, but to be honest I\u2019m extremely shy. If you\u2019re in the area and interested in something like that, feel free to e-mail me and maybe that will help me become more motivated!\nExtensive reading is known as \u591a\u8aad, or tadoku in Japanese. To try it, start with very easy books (ones with no more than two or three unknown words per page), and follow these principles:\n1. Don\u2019t look up words in the dictionary while reading.\n2. Skip over parts you don\u2019t understand.\n3. If you aren\u2019t enjoying one book, toss it aside and get another.\nFind something to read!\n"}, {"score": 1276.75, "uuid": "b2035c49-5832-55ba-8cd4-f981eb38a53a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0003wb-33-32359", "target_hostname": "homeschooling.gomilpitas.com", "target_uri": "http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/explore/greek.htm", "page_rank": 1.2057438e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Greek Lessons - <em>A</em> to Z Home&#x27;s Cool Homeschooling <em>Foreign</em> <em>Languages</em>", "snippet": "Once you&#x27;ve tried the introductory lessons have <em>a</em> go <em>at</em> our new Interactive Activity Centre.

I've used it for 8-9 years with my home schoolers. Thank you so much!!\nI came upon your Greek curriculum at a Homeschool Curriculum Fair in Nashville, TN, when my twin girls were 5th graders and their little sister was a second grader. It truly has been a great joy for me to have a way to share this love [of Greek] with my children. I am glad for the opportunity to thank you personally! I think your incremental approach is excellent. I've found it to work so well with my girls. We all have loved bite-by-bite-sized pieces on an almost daily basis over the years. My twins attended Humanities class at Franklin Classical School their junior and senior years and the school counted our Greek work as a substitute for the school's Latin requirement. They have just finished their freshman year at Belmont University. Their Greek work is something all three of my daughters are thankful for. My youngest just finished her freshman year in high school and we plan to continue our Greek study next year with Level 7.\nI have loved the opportunity for personal review as I have taught the girls.\nWe are grateful for your work.

Back when she was five years old, she said, \"Daddy, will you teach me Greek?\" -- as if it could be done in an afternoon. I said, \"Sure,\" and taught her the oral alphabet in 20 minutes with a made up tune. I have a Ph.D. in New Testament and Greek and have taught Greek at the seminary level during the last two years of my Ph.D. program and then at a small Christian college...When my lovely homeschooling wife found the Hey Andrew curriculum, I was DELIGHTED!...Karen's work simply brought NT Greek into simple and efficient workbook format in an eye-pleasing, kid-friendly way.\nShe includes loads of built-in review of vocabulary and grammar forms that is absolutely necessary for a 30 year old seminary student to reach mastery or a lower-grade child to incrementally build mastery. Seminary Greek classes are high stress, high speed, high intensity courses that are often wash-out courses to weed people out...But Evangelical kids can learn Greek in a natural way over several years while their memorizing capabilities are highest. Karen Mohs is to be thanked and praised for making a system where kids can find themselves doing Greek ( i.e. reading and translating) without being loaded down with abstract concepts and nomenclature of grammar.

Often they work ahead, and say that they 'love' Latin! They enjoy learning Greek too. Now that's saying something for your approach! A little bit each day is all they can handle, and over time it's neat to see what they have learned. I am thankful that the books are 'levels' and not age or grade related so that the focus can be on learning and not whether it is above or beneath them. Since I am not as confident teaching Latin as I would another language, I really appreciate the format of the workbook which has helped them learn independently. When I check their work, they share with me what they have learned. It gives me great pleasure to see them confidently translating.

I want my children to dive into God's Word, but feel like they do need guidance at this point, and while I can do that (and do it during school & family worship along with my husband), I want them to be able to study God's Word apart from me as well... because ultimately this is THEIR relationship with God... not just MY relationship with God.\nI appreciate the effort that you have put into creating these publications.

My name\u2019s Donovan and I run a language learning blog called The Mezzofanti Guild where I share insights and tips on learning languages from my own experience and my background in linguistics.\nCorey has done a wonderful job with the Language Challenge 180 and she was kind enough to invite me to share my thoughts with you on what I believe is a vital language learning topic.\nI want to start out by saying that this challenge is such a fantastic idea and it\u2019s so good to see that it\u2019s generated great interest from so many enthusiastic language learners and bilingual parents.\nI strongly encourage you to stick with it and see the fruit of your efforts at the end, and if you stumbled across this article but aren\u2019t part of it yet then I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not too late to join in !\nPlanning beyond the beginner \u2018honeymoon\u2019 stage of language learning\nIn the very early stages of learning a new language you\u2019ll experience lots of big, rapid gains. Huge gains.\nThe beginner stage of the language learning process is the period in which everything is new and exciting (the honeymoon period of language learning), and every new thing that you learn feels like an enormous victory over new language content. At this stage, the gains are obvious and it\u2019s usually the most energetic and uplifting period for us as language learners.\nPretty much every language book and course begins with the same typical structure \u2013 the new alphabet, new phonetics and the basics (greetings, basic introductions and so on) and these are the things that we all tend to push through very quickly.\nBeyond these basics however, whether we\u2019re learning the language for the first time or reactivating it from a previous attempt, how do we work out and keep track of our progress to make sure we\u2019re consistently moving forward and keeping on track?\nIt\u2019s vitally important for us to be able to look back and actually see that we\u2019ve continued to make progress and to rise rather than plateau.\nNo structure = slow progress\nIt\u2019s very difficult to see the extent of your progress in a foreign language if you\u2019re learning haphazardly without clearly defined goals and structured planning.\nDon\u2019t worry. Planning some structure for your learning is a lot more enjoyable and easier to do than it sounds.\nIt\u2019s not enough to make broad targets like I want better listening comprehension or I want to be able to speak better. These goals aren\u2019t really measurable over the short to mid term.\nYou need a series of micro goals that serve as checkpoints in your language learning so that when you stand back and take a look at everything you\u2019ve done so far, you can clearly see a progression from where you started until now.\nI find the best and most effective way to do this is to create a sequential learning plan based on topics and themes.\nTracking your progress through topics and themes\nI\u2019m going to share a method I use that is a very practical way of ensuring and keeping track of your progress which I believe will be hugely beneficial for you and your family during the Language Challenge 180 and in any future foreign language pursuit.\nThis is something that I, as an experienced adult language learner have had success with many times in my own learning endeavors and I\u2019ve also found this to be very useful as an ESL teacher when teaching English to kids overseas.\nIt\u2019s applicable to both individual adult learners and bilingual parents learning with their kids and spouses.\nHere it is. You ready?\nLet\u2019s assume (to use a random example) that you\u2019re a parent with a son who loves baseball.\nYou, the parent, have decided that both of you are participating in the Language Challenge 180 to learn\u2026 let\u2019s say\u2026 Arabic together.\nHe\u2019s mildly enthusiastic about Arabic and you\u2019re finding it difficult to track your progress and keep him interested at the same time.\nThis is what you do:\nGrab yourself a calendar (one with big squares so you can write in them) and a pen!\nWrite in the topic for the first week of the month: baseball.\nThis week you\u2019re going to pay special attention to all the vocab in Arabic related to baseball:\ne.g. hit, bat, base, ball, run, slide, catch, glove, cap\u2026\nUse a dictionary and write up a list of related words or phrases and break them up so you\u2019re learning 3 to 5 of them every day or every two days. Try to mix them up so you\u2019re getting a couple of nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on each day.\nRemember that even though you\u2019re focusing on a topic like baseball, many of these words are common and useful in lots of other contexts as well.\nCreate your own resources! It\u2019s very easy to whip something together as a visual aid to help yourself or your kids learn vocabulary (as an ESL teacher I do this a lot!).\nCreate your own visual aids!\nThis is important: focus on only one verb form each week. So for the first week you could just practice using Present Continuous \u2013 I am hitting the ball, he is sliding on to the base, etc. The following week (with a new topic), you switch to a different tense and so on.\nAt the end of the week, you and your son will have targets for speaking, listening, reading and writing around that theme:\nHave a simple chat to each other or a native speaker (preferrably) about baseball\nWrite a short letter about what you both love about baseball\nRead something in the target language about sport and look for \u2018baseball words\u2019\nListen to a sports commentary and try really hard to recognize any of the same words\nIf it\u2019s an activity like baseball you can try to incorporate this in to an actual game of baseball to make interesting and rewarding for kids\nYou can simplify or increase the difficulty of this as much as you like. This is also something you can do with a spouse or on your own. Each week you\u2019d have a new theme or topic to focus on and a monthly revision to go over the previous four weeks.\nThink about getting to the end of these 180 days and being able to look back at all the progress you\u2019ve made and the new topics that you and your family are now able to talk about. You will have also covered a lot of grammar and vocabulary that\u2019s useful in a multitude of other contexts!\nGood luck and let me know how it goes!\nDonovan Nagel is an Aussie freelance translator, qualified linguist (Masters in Applied Linguistics), ESL teacher and experienced traveller. He is passionate about learning new languages and sharing what he\u2019s learned with others. Before his postgraduate studies he completed a Theology degree and a few tough years translating Koine Greek and Ancient Hebrew. He later specialized in Arabic. His first exposure to foreign language study was in school where he undertook compulsory Mandarin Chinese classes for 4 years. Since then he\u2019s had formal classes in French, Spanish, Modern Standard, Levantine and Egyptian Arabic, and Georgian. Other languages that he\u2019s studied informally are German, Italian and Russian.

Any one of them can easily derail the students' efforts in language acquisition and learning or cause them grave problems. So, review these areas, make any needed adjustments to your teaching practice. Don't you be a stumbling block to your learners' progress.\n1. Don't adapt materials to the learning style and characteristics of the students.\nUnfortunately, the learning style most reflected in the classroom is that of the teacher. It is paramount that concepts and material be presented in a way most suitable for the learners. Jack C. Richards, principal author of the widely popular Interchange textbook series said, \"Student learning styles may be an important factor in the success of teaching and may not necessarily reflect those that teachers recommend.\" Why? Because teachers use their own preferences in the class room, not necessarily those of the students. Do an analysis of your class group\u0092s learning characteristics, then apply the results to your teaching.\n2. Follow the course book.\nA course book is usually not intended to be a \"bible\", but all too often teachers follow it \"religiously\". They do nothing else, nor include outside materials in their teaching. If you read the teacher's notes that typically accompany an English or language text, you'll most likely note that the course book is intended to be a guide for teaching with supplementary materials widely used to expand, deepen or reinforce presented materials and themes. Use the course book sequence as a guide. Freely supplement its exercises and course materials with your own creations or at the very least with materials adapted from other sources. As mentioned in point number one, plan your lessons and materials to meet the needs, learning styles and characteristics of your learners.\n3. Don't encourage and promote language practice outside the classroom.\nWith an alarming number of schools and institutes decreasing student to teacher classroom contact hours per week it is essential for learners to receive additional practice and input. There are requirements of as little as four hours per week or even less in many publicly or government-funded educational centers. Can a student really learn a language in only 45 hours? Or put it this way, is it reasonable to expect mastery of any sort in a language after six or seven days in a foreign country where that language is spoken? Spread that contact intensity over a six-month period; does that make language learning and acquisition better or worse? Now, throw in the learners using their first language half of each day of language learning and you have a situation degraded to a nearly impossible state.\nFinally, factor in class and semester breaks of several weeks per year and it's certainly no wonder Jorge, Chen Shen or Efrosini can't hold even a basic conversation after studying English (or another foreign language) under these conditions for two, three or even more years. Encouragement and promotion of foreign language practice outside the class room is absolutely vital to the success of the learners.\nSo again, don't you be a stumbling block to your learners' progress. If you are guilty of any of these erroneous practices in ELT or language teaching, make any needed adjustments to your teaching practice ASAP. Then watch your learners grow, improve and practice their new language like never before.

Stuck for ideas? Here's how to encourage language learning in the home...\nTailor-made language courses for business and individuals\nTalk to Cactus Tailor-made for more information on training worldwide in over 25 languages in a range of blended learning options available to your organization.\nIt\u2019s well known that learning something when you\u2019re young is the secret to learning it well, and for life. No more so is this relevant than in learning a foreign language, which \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as any adult learner will testify \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is infinitely more difficult later in life.\nA child, on the other hand, its brain growing rapidly and eager to absorb new things, can soak up a new language without even realizing it. Expose them to a second language at an early age and they show an enviably innate ability to learn new words and develop a natural pronunciation, all whilst benefitting from a lack of inhibition which so often hinders us later in life.\nThe earlier you introduce your child to a foreign language the better; it seems that before the age of 10 is ideal, even before the age of 5 if you can. Yet whether you\u2019re dealing with a toddler or adolescent, there is plenty you can do to encourage your child to learn a language, and you don\u2019t even have to be good at languages yourself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you could even take this as an opportunity to learn a language alongside your child!\nHere are our top 10 ways to encourage language learning at home:\n1. Nursery rhymes and songs\nYounger children react positively to the repetition and melody of nursery rhymes and songs. Even if they don\u2019t understand the words at first, this is a fun yet effective way to absorb a foreign language. Go beyond Fr\u00e8re Jacques by buying a CD of French songs such as French Playground or 60 Comptines pour Cr\u00e8che ; alternatively, the BBC website offers fun, basic songs for primary school-aged children. Grab a few instruments and have a morning of music and fun!\n2. Story tapes\nSearch for your child\u2019s favourite story in another language. Bob the Builder becomes Bob le Bricoleur, Little Red Riding Hood becomes Le Petit Chaperon Rouge, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs becomes Blancanieve y los 7 enanitos. Even Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer have been translated. Read the foreign language version along with your child, or play the CD that narrates the story for you both.\n3. Word & picture cards\nA basic idea, but a great way to learn and remember vocabulary, as it is much easier to remember a word when associated with a colourful image. Simply write the name of an object, in the target language, next to a picture of that object. Then stick these cards around the house, for constant exposure, or bring them out as a game to name objects in the house or garden.\n4. Indulge in the local culture!\nIf it takes a chocolat chaud and a croissant, then so be it. Pretend that you are living in France for the day and surround yourselves at home with French-related goodies. Put on some French music or French radio in the background, draw a French flag, make a necklace with red, white and blue beads, chop up a baguette and French cheeses for lunch, play boules in the garden, and maybe end the day with a trip to the local cr\u00eaperie. It\u2019s the next best thing to being in France.\n5. Find a pen pal\nOnce you child is a bit older and knows the basics in a foreign language, finding a pen pal is a great way to practise the language and exert some independence. There\u2019s nothing like the excitement of an air mail letter dropping on the doormat, or an email into the Inbox, to encourage a flurry of letter-writing back. Having a pen pal abroad is also a great way to learn about culture in another country and appreciate the differences in lifestyle, eg. school, food, holidays, hobbies, etc.\n6. Interactive learning\nLike it or not, your child will grow up aware of computers and most likely wanting to be on one. Fortunately there are language-related programmes online that both encourage interaction and serve an educational purpose. For younger children, the BBC\u2019s Muzzy series is a fun language course led by a cuddly, green character and comprising DVDs, audio, songs and written work. Older children already familiar with Wii and Nintendo may like their My French Coach (and My Spanish Coach ) language software. An easy compromise if they want to play a computer game, these games are fun and interactive whilst providing the basics of grammar, phrase construction, pronunciation tests and a dictionary.\n7. Podcasts\nOlder children will love the technology and independence of downloading their own free language podcasts from iTunes . Le Journal en Fran\u00e7ais Facile is a daily and easily-understood podcast delivering the nightly news from Radio France Internationale, and likewise Langsam gesprochene Nachrichten does so in German. Follow with the transcript to catch those words you\u2019re not sure of.\n8. Talk about them in another language\nAn unexpected entry, perhaps, but a cunning ploy if you and your partner both speak another language. A colleague at work revealed that the most successful way to get his girls to learn French was to chat to his wife, about them, in French. Frustrated at not understanding the conversation, the girls had immediate impetus to up their game and catch their parents out. Sure enough, as dad told mum one night that he thought \u201cElle est fatigu\u00e9e\u201d, the oldest daughter responded quite indignantly, \u201cJe ne suis PAS fatigu\u00e9e!\u201d.\n9. Speak the language yourself\nAlong these lines goes the age-old philosophy that you should practise what you preach. If your kids hear you speaking a language at home they will be more likely to speak it themselves. Drop in key words or phrases around the house, such as when you want them to pass you something, at meal times or bathtime. Repetition and familiarity will one day have them saying the same things back to you; even if at first they don\u2019t understand, their little brains will be absorbing more than you think.\n10. Go abroad\nMoney permitting, obviously, a trip to the country of the language your child is learning can do wonders for his or her motivation and progress. Using language in its natural context is one of the best ways for it to really sink in. In the exciting run-up to your holiday you can all practise the language together, and once there your child will absorb all the sights and sounds, hopefully practise the basics, and get a real feel for another culture. Being able to travel and speak to people of other nationalities and cultures is, after all, what learning a language is all about.\n"}, {"score": 1241.7086, "uuid": "037ee210-06d3-5f96-be9b-856f00987398", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-69-11461", "target_hostname": "nclrc.org", "target_uri": "http://nclrc.org/teachers_corner/languages_dora/learning_fl.html", "page_rank": 1.1954427e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "NCLRC | Teachers Corner | <em>Languages</em> - Ask Dora | <em>Learning</em> Foreing <em>Languages</em>", "snippet": "Please send me information regarding <em>adults</em> <em>learning</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>languages</em> linguistically on their own.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learning Chinese in Washington DC\nDear Dora,\nI am a recent college graduate in Washington, DC looking to begin studying Mandarin Chinese. Is there anywhere that I can get a list of programs for the area? I work on Capitol Hill.\nHello!\nFrom your e-mail I'm assuming that you are not interested in enrolling in a degree program, but are interested in working on the language. There are basically only two options that I know of, although sometimes university programs do offer language courses for non-degree applicants. The best and least expensive possibility is for you to contact the US Department of Agriculture Graduate School ( www.grad.usda.gov ),just down the street from you at 14th and Independence. They have several levels of course offerings, and my guess is that Chinese is one of the languages that they offer on a regular basis. The person to contact is Dr. Maria Wilmeth. The last phone number I have for her is 202-690-4724, and her e-mail is maria_wilmeth@grad.usda.gov .The other option is for you to contact one of the proprietary schools,of which there are many, for lessons. The advantage of proprietary schools is that they can tailor their teaching to your needs. The disadvantage is that they are more costly. For Chinese, I would say any of the larger schools such as Berlitz and Inlingua would do fine. Downtown, you might want to try the International Center for Language Studies on 15th Street, and in Arlington there is Diplomatic Language Services. These are but a few suggested names. There are many others.\nOf the universities, American University, Georgetown, George WashingtonUniversity, and Johns Hopkins University's Advanced International Studies in the District of Columbia offer Chinese. In Maryland, the closest is U of Maryland, College Park although UM BaltimoreCounty also offers it. It is highly possible that the University of Maryland University College also offers Chinese. UMUC is also involved in a fair amount of distance learning, but I haven't heard anything about their language programs in that area. The person to contact there is Dr. Lucinda Hart-Gonzalez. And in Virginia, the only institution I can find that offers Chinese that's within easy commuting distance is Northern Virginia Community College in Woodbridge. I hope this is of help.\nDora\nAt what age should I start to introduce my toddler to a second language, and how do I ensure there is no language confusion?\nDear Dora,\nI am learning French. My son is a year old. I was hoping when he is a little older and I am a little better at it, I could teach him/ learn with him. I have access to Sesame Street in French and other youth programs that would be perfect for both of us. So the question is, at what age should I start to introduce the second language? Also is there something special I should do to make sure he doesn't have language confusion? Everyone keeps telling me that I will confuse him and hurt his language skills, unless I speak French all the time, but this is not really an option.\nHello!\nThere is a fair amount of information on this topic, the bottom line being: don't listen to your well-meaning friends! There are some issues in early child language learning where you may have to make some choices. I am forwarding your question to Ingrid Pufahl who coordinates some of our (Center for Applied Linguistics) early foreign language learning information. She can send you a whole host of resources that you can use with your child, plus what are possible ways in which you can connect with other parents who find themselves in the same situation.\n*Ingrid Pufahl: I think it's a great idea to expose your child to another language. Probably at this time, your best bet would be to ask this question on our listserv. I know that one of our contributors is working on a book that is a resource guide for parents, showing ways to encourage their young children's foreign language learning. To ask this question, please go to www.cal.org/earlylang and follow the link on how to join \u00d1andu. You may also find other interesting information on this website. Also, depending on where you live, you may find a play group for your child that would support his French. Good luck.\nIngrid / Dora\nIs there a standard test for proficiency in Chinese?\nDear Dora,\nI'm a 2 year student of Chinese--including one year study abroad in China. I've been thinking about going into translating. Is there a standard test that's more or less internationally recognized that would give me an idea of my level of proficiency? I assume that I'd want to present the results of such a test to any potential employer whether they be Chinese or American.\nHello!\nI don't know if the American Translators Association ( www.atanet.org ) has devised an accreditation test in Chinese. My guess is that it has not. However, you need to contact them directly. If they don't offer the test, they may be able to provide you with a source that can help you. The last e-mail address for general inquiries I have is maggie@ata.net --the person is Maggie Row. If that doesn't work, the phone number is 703/683-6100. Address: 225 Reinekers Lane, Suite 590 Alexandria, VA 22314.\nAlthough many people successfully set up shop, and often there is no need to pass any particular test (at least in this country as of this date), becoming a good translator takes some training. You may want to check two schools that do offer this type of training. One is the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the other is the Monterey Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. Finally, you may also want to contact the Chinese Language Teachers Association . They do have a fairly complete Web site. The headquarters are at the University of Hawaii even though Ohio State hosts the Web site. This is the contact info: Chinese Language Teachers Association, Center for Chinese Studies, Moore Hall #416, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822. Tel: (808) 956-2692. Executive Director, Prof. Cynthia Ning, Email: cyndy@hawaii.edu . Good luck in your search.\nDora\nCan learning a secondary language as a young person have an impact on academic learning?\nDear Dora,\nI am in the middle of my research on learning secondary languages, specifically, \"Can learning a secondary language as a young person have an impact on academic learning?\" I have been having problems getting updated material, and I need to hear from other people or groups that have covered this area\nHello!\nThe ERIC Clearinghouse on Languages and Linguistics ( www.cal.org/ericcll ) has a fair amount of information on this topic. The Center for Applied Linguistics Web site also has information on the topic under the early language learning heading. You can also join the Nandu listserv ( www.cal.org/earlylang/ ), post your question on it, and will probably get more responses than you care to list! The Foreign Language Teaching Forum (FLTeach), http://www.cortland.edu/flteach is another good listserv.\nDora\nBack to top\nCould you recommend a good school for learning Arabic?\nDear Dora, I'm an adult who wants to learn Arabic. Could you recommend a fine, excellent school? Thank you.\nHello!\nWhere are you located? The programs at University of Michigan, Ohio State, Brigham Young, Middlebury, University of Georgia, Georgetown University, are possible places to get a good introduction to the language. The problem is whether they actually accept students for no credit during the school year. You'd have to check with them. Middlebury has a wonderful summer intensive program, and I believe Michigan and Georgetown also have summer programs.\nIf you are in the Washington, DC area, the Middle East Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Graduate School are the two places where Arabic is taught regularly for non-academic purposes.\nI suggest that you go to http://www.carla.acad.umn.edu/LCTL/ . There you will find the best list I know of where Arabic is taught, with contact information.\nDora\nWhat does a career in linguistics actually entail? Is it a rewarding career choice?\nDear Dora,\nI am curious as to what a career in linguistics would actually entail? I am unclear as to what it would be like to work as a professional in this capacity. I am only asking very basic questions since I am unaware in any regard what this career choice would be like, what opportunities are available for specializing, and finally what kind of a \"working life\" it provides. Is it rewarding on a personal, intellectual, and financial level? Does one feel like they have contributed at the end of the day, and is fairly compensated for that good work? Are fellow professionals interesting, challenging, and engaging? What opportunities are available for research, travel, and interesting life experiences?\nHello!\nLots of questions! I'm not quite sure whether we can satisfactorily answer all your questions since any career can take you into places you may or may not want to go, and you may end up working with people you like or don't like. And like most careers, there are days when you think you've done a lot of good and other days when you wonder what happened to the day!\nYou may want to go to www.cal.org/ericll and click on the Resource guides online icon and look for the guide on linguistics. This has a very short and very basic description of some of the various types of linguistics that one can specialize in.\nBeyond that, much depends on the kind of work you want to do. For example, there are linguists who labor mightily and hard in Native and Indigenous American languages in a real effort to revitalize them. This is tough work, but satisfying. That can take care of one's wanting to save the world feelings. There are linguists who do this all over the world -- endangered languages are a real issue. That would mean getting trained in formal linguistics so one knows what one is looking at.\nThere is work that you can do for the government. These days much of it entails language analysis, computational work, and translation (more than just one word at a time). Often these jobs require clearance. Generally, most of these jobs require actual language proficiency, particularly of those we call the less commonly taught languages (everything but French, Spanish, English, and German).\nThere is assessment work that you can think about. Measurement issues in language learning and teaching are big -- in fact, a real problem. With that, however, comes the need to also be trained in fundamental measurement and research methods. I would say that if you are trained in both, at least for the foreseeable future, you would not lack for work! Some of it can be mind numbing, but then most work has those aspects to it.\nThen there is teaching. This is probably the least available these days. There is a split between what it known as theoretical linguistics and applied linguistics. Most theoretical linguists toil in academia or in places like Microsoft. Applied linguists find themselves in a whole variety of places -- again in academia, but also in education and psychology, etc.\nAnd then there are things like forensic linguistics. And there are people who cross language and the law, language and medicine, language and (hard) science, language and anthropology, language and politics, language and public relations, language and advertising. The possibilities are endless!\nWhat I think is wonderful about linguistics is that its study touches on all aspects of life. As human beings, we are language bound, and consequently it affects everything that we process and that comes out of our mouths and is communicated by our bodies. Even if you don't end up \"doing linguistics\" in a formal way, its study it seems to me would enrich anything that you may end up doing. Good luck!\nDora\nWhat second language should I teach my child?\nHi Dora,\nI would like my children to start learning a foreign language. Trouble is I can't decide which one. My preference is for a language that is widely used, and easy to learn. Maybe Japanese, seeing as we live in Australia. Any advice is appreciated.\nHello!\nIt's a little difficult to pass on advice to you. My inclination is for you to introduce the children to one of the Pacific Rim languages. Obviously Japanese and Chinese are the two big ones, but Australia is involved with Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia -- any one of them would be useful to them later on, depending on what they want to be!\nNone of these languages are enormously easy to learn (although one could also say that of English if one were the speaker of these other languages!). But they can be fun depending on how it's taught. There are many programs for Japanese and Chinese now. I haven't seen anything for children in the other languages, but I would be willing to guess that there are some produced in Australia in the last 20 years since there has been so much emphasis on encouraging the learning of heritage languages as well as languages of the countries Australia is involved with. It would take some doing, but it seems to me that if all of you embarked on learning the rudiments of one of these languages then the children could go on once they enter school.\nI don't know where you live, but are you living in an area where there is a large group of immigrants (Greeks, Middle Easterners, Armenians)? If so, perhaps one possible introduction to a foreign language might be to investigate a Saturday school and send the children there if there are classes for them at that age.\nFinally, I suggest that you might want to contact Joe LoBianco at Language Australia in Canberra. He will be able to put you in touch with a teacher or group that can give you much better advice than we can from this distance.\nDora\nSo many languages, so many opportunities?\nDear Dora,\nMy query is in regards to choice of languages. I have good proficiency in French, Portuguese and Spanish. I now have an opportunity to study Russian, Chinese, German, Arabic or Italian. I love languages and they seem to come easily to me but I realize that I eventually have to earn a living. Where can one use this type of expertise? Do you have any suggestions?\nHello!\nThere are any number of ways in which one can earn one's living using languages, none of them easy! Much does depend, however, on your proficiency. \"Good proficiency\" needs to be quantified, and that's curiously harder to come by once you get to the very advanced levels. So once you know that you want to quantify your proficiency (as in what level you are), then you need to contact Language Testing International (LTI), Tel: 914-948-5100. There is a cost attached to the tests, but the effort may be worthwhile if you're planning to use your languages to earn some income.\nLTI, however, generally tests for speaking proficiency, not writing proficiency. For writing tests, you may want to check the Foreign Language Test Database maintained by the National Capital Language Resource Center and see what is available ( www.nclrc.org/fltestdb ) and contact the group that administers the test.\nThe largest consumer of foreign language expertise is the federal government. There are some 85 agencies that need language expertise of various types. They range from being a State Department escort (which means traveling with visitors) to working for the \"super secrets\" like the National Security Agency. Of course, the latter will require security clearance, which can take a long time.\nThere is also translation work. Being a good translator is hard work and takes a long time but if you are good at it, you will not lack for work. You will need to be certified, and that means going through the American Translators Association ( http://www.ata.org/ ). There are also private translation companies, many of whom are now going into computer-assisted translation. This is a growing field and you may want to investigate those companies. My guess is that those groups tend to need editors, but again your language skills will need to be quite advanced.\nYou can also teach. There are the private language schools. They don't pay well, and the benefits are lousy, but they are a place to get some experience. You can also consider teaching in the school system. Certified foreign language teachers with proficiency are in demand. There is a growing cadre of immersion and two-way language programs that are in need of good teachers. But that would mean you would have to put up with little or not-so-little kids!\nThen there is private industry. This is probably a more iffy area. Many industries tend to use in-country personnel to do their language work for them, but we have been told over and over again that when they do have people who speak the language of the country fluently, it makes a great deal of difference in the way business is conducted. You may want to contact your local university business school and ask to speak with the professor who is involved in international business. He/She might be able to put you in touch with a resource that's helpful. There are, incidentally, groups that specialize in communications that use foreign language. I'm afraid I can't give you the specific information, but I suspect once you start doing the research you'll find them. I hope this is helpful and will get you started.\nDora\nHow do I reaquaint myself with a language after minimal infrequent use?\nDear Dora,\nHelp! About twenty years ago, I could speak, write and read in Arabic, but now I can only understand it when it is spoken. What is the best way to pick it up again? Are there any books on the subject? Do I have to start over fresh? Thank you for your time.\nHello!\nHow does one advise another in such cases? I feel the same way! To think that I actually passed exams in Arabic many moons ago, I now stumble through many a conversation and have to concentrate very hard to read a newspaper!\nHowever, having said that, the general wisdom is that one never quite loses one's language, so that delving back into it is not such an ordeal. It depends on whether you want to refresh your language skills on your own or whether you want to do it somewhat more formally.\nIt seems to me less painful if you decided to \"start over fresh,\" as you put it. I don't think it would be a good idea for you to start at the beginning -- you will be amazed how much you probably have retained if you were educated in the language. I would enroll in essentially what is an intermediate level Arabic class if I felt my comprehension was high enough. Most likely, you will struggle for a few weeks trying to get some of the old grammar rules under control.\nIf your education consisted of informal exposure, then I'd be inclined to say that you may want to enroll in a beginning class. Some of the stuff will be old hat and boring, but teachers are usually willing to add more work for students who are a little more advanced than the rest of the class.\nI don't know where you live, but if you are in the Washington, DC area, the two places to check out are the US Department of Agriculture Graduate School and the Middle East Institute.\nIf you think you want to do this on your own, then I'd suggest that you go to the Language Materials Project database ( www.lmp.ucla.edu ) and look at the Modern Standard Arabic textbooks. There are a fair number on the market that have tapes/CDs, etc. attached to them, and you can pick the one that look like it might be what suits your learning style, and dive in.\nLanguage, like riding a bicycle, is not quite ever forgotten. It takes getting on it again and careening around a bit. But I think one can do it without encountering too many broken bones!\nDora\nHow do I go about teaching my child a second language?\nDear Dora,\nI am writing to you from a small town in New Zealand. We are interested in teaching our children a second language. Both my husband and I only speak English. We have recently bought a computer with the purpose of using it to teach our children.\nWe have contact with many overseas people - we traveled for a year on bicycle and now invite foreign cyclists into our home. Our 3 year old seems very bright (not just to us), she also has the ability to sit for long periods of time, and we would like to make the most of her enthusiasm for learning.\nHello!\nThere are quite a number of early childhood foreign language programs now available. We are not equipped to evaluate them, so I suggest that you contact the National Foreign Language Resource Center at the address below. Their focus is on K-12, but I'm sure they also are collecting information on earlier years. You may also want to ask the Center about the guidelines they use when evaluating foreign language materials.\nThe National Foreign Language Resource Center at Iowa State University - http://www.nflrc.iastate.edu/homepage.html : This center focuses on improving student learning of foreign languages in Grades K-12. The center's work is focused on the use of effective teaching strategies, administration and interpretation of foreign language performance assessments, and the use of new technologies in the foreign language classroom.\nAnother resource is http://www.cal.org/earlylang , which focuses on early language learning issues in grades K-8. You could look into joining the electronic mailing list for school district personnel, superintendents, teachers, college and university teacher educators, and parents. It is sponsored by the Improving Foreign Language Instruction project of the Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory at Brown University (LAB), and funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\nIt sounds like your little girl has a wonderful, bright future ahead. Best wishes!\nDora\nDoes learning a second language enhance my marketability?\nDear Dora,\nI am a junior in high school who is studying Spanish and French and planning to major in Spanish in college. I was told by a friend in college that if I major in language, it would open many opportunities for me. Is it true?\nHello!\nLearning another language is always advantageous! I think you need to think about what you see yourself doing once you get out of college. There is no doubt that in the foreseeable future, being fluent in Spanish will give you opportunities in the social services and health fields, in teaching, and in business. French perhaps, may be not so immediately useful on this side of the Atlantic, but it certainly would be very useful if you are thinking about going into international work since there are still large areas of the world where French continues to play an important role and as people take it less and less there will probably be a shortage. There is a shortage of French teachers here, for example.\nIf you are willing to undergo the rigorous training of becoming an interpreter (and it is rigorous!), there are also many opportunities in that field. Good interpreters are always in demand according to those in the know. If nothing else, being fluent in a language opens up all sorts of wonderful doors - for your own personal satisfaction. I am sure you are already finding out how wonderful it is to be able to converse in another language. Keep it up! Then combine it with something you think you want to do in college and you surely will come out ahead!\nDora\nHow do I teach my three year old nephew Spanish?\nDear Dora,\nI am trying to teach my 3.5 year old nephew to speak Spanish. Any thoughts on how to go about this?\nHello!\nThere are a number of resources in various places on our Web site ( http://www.cal.org ). Plug in Early Language Learning and I think you'll find a fair number of publications that will give you a sense of what directions to take.\nYou may also want to join the \u00f1anduti electronic mailing list , which you can do through this site: http://www.cal.org/earlylang/ . Posting your question will probably bring you more answers than you want, but it's a good place to elicit responses from parents and teachers. For example, at one point there was a lot of discussion about the use of video in language teaching/learning. Parents and teachers have shared what they do with their pre-K to higher elementary school students. What they use, what approaches they use, the \"tricks of the trade\", etc.\nIf none of this proves satisfactory, contact Nancy Rhodes ( nancy@cal.org ) and she can put you in touch with a couple of people who can give you more detailed information.\nDora\nWhich of these languages: Russian Korean, Hindi, is the most difficult to learn from the viewpoint of an American speaker?\nDear Dora,\nI am interested in learning Russian, Korean, or Hindi. Since learning a language is a long-term, intensive investment of time, money, interest, etc., I want to make the right choice now. My question is: which language should I learn?\nI use Spanish and Portuguese daily at work and in my family and social life. (I am also familiar with French and Latin). For years, I was a Spanish and English, ESL and American Literature instructor. Consequently, I am fully familiar with the techniques and trials of learning a foreign language and grammatical terms and explanations do not confuse or overwhelm me.\nI live in a cosmopolitan area, so I know that I could practice all three if I made the effort. Moreover, I have access to magazines, cassettes, and books in all three languages. So that is not an issue either. My primary reason for learning one of these three languages is simply self-improvement and a personal interest in foreign language acquisition.\nPronunciation is probably the greatest single factor in my making a decision followed by grammatical and syntactical difficulty. Which of the three languages-Russian, Korean, and Hindi-would you say is the easiest to pronounce and which is the most difficult from the standpoint of an American speaker? Is Korean a tonal language as many other Asian tongues are?\nHello!\nYou have a bit of a tall order and I'm not sure that we could answer your needs in any satisfactory manner. In your case, it's a matter of choice, rather than job-related or a matter of survival!\nKorean is not a tonal language so that is not a problem. If you are able to figure out Korean writing, I don't think you'd have that much trouble with Hindi either. Think of the writing system as a laundry line with symbols hanging off it. According to a Russian expert who recently conducted workshops for a project related to the National Capital Language Resource Center (NCLRC), Russian is about as straightforward a language as one can get. The alphabet is easy to learn (what you see is what you get), and there is little variation in dialects. But like most languages, as you know, once one gets beyond a certain level, communication takes on much more complicated set of nuances.\nIt seems to me that you may want to make your decision based on what you want to use the language for. If you're only going to learn it for the fun of it and not use it a whole lot as you seem to do with your other languages, then it seems to me, you should make the decision based on how much of the literature, the newspapers, the news (via satellite), etc. you are going to indulge in. Pronunciation might take a back seat in that case -- and comprehension and listening and reading skills would be more important. If you think you are going to be interacting with people from the language group, then pronunciation obviously will be an important factor . Then you would need to decide whether you want to go simple (Russian) or difficult (Hindi). My guess is that Korean falls in the middle, if such a thing can be measured.\nWhat I think might be the best thing is for you to perhaps go to one of the university libraries that have linguistics programs, and look for a volume called The World's Major Languages, ed. by Bernard Comrie. There are good understandable descriptions of the phonologies for each of these languages in the book and you might be able to compare them and make an informed judgment based on your needs and interests.\nDora\nBeginning level Demotiki. Help!\nDear Dora,\nI am interested in Greek language study, Demotiki, especially conversation. I have had some lessons in the language, and am probably at the beginner/tourist level. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\nHello!\nI am not quite sure whether you are interested in taking classes or whether you are interested in going it alone. For information about materials you will need to search on the Language Materials Project. Go to http://www.lmp.ucla.edu .\nIf it's classes, your choices may be somewhat limited. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School sometimes offers Greek, if there are enough students to make up a class. Contact Maria Wilmeth at 202/690-4724 or e-mail: MWilmeth@smtpgate.grad.usda.gov . The Greek church on 16th Street has also been known to offer classes although I haven't been in contact with them in quite a while. Whether they are continuing or not, I don't know, but you could give them a call. And of course there are the proprietary schools which are more costly, but are also able to tailor classes to your needs. One school is the International Center for Language Studies on 15th Street, NW. Phone number is 202/639-8800. You could try asking for Vesna Putic Other schools are Berlitz, Inlingua, and Diplomatic Language Services although there are a number of others in the area. The Yellow Pages are one place to start.\nFinally, the person who knows where all the resources are is Dr. James E. Alatis at Georgetown University. Summertime may be a hard time to get him, but you could try calling his office at 202/687-5659. His assistant will know how you can reach him. Who knows, maybe he'll let you sit in on his classes!\nDora\nHelp! Only six months to learn Moroccan Arabic before leaving on holiday!\nDear Dora,\nI am going to Morocco in a couple of months. I need to learn the commonly spoken dialect. I understand it is a mix of many languages! If you can provide me with assistance on how to go about learning this dialect, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\nHello!\nFor some curious reason, to my knowledge, new Moroccan Arabic textbooks have not been issued recently. The ones I know of are from the 60s and the 70s. They're quite adequate, but with the exception of a couple of French books and the Lonely Planet phrase book, the only two sets of books I know of are those produced by Georgetown University Press and the University of Michigan Dept. of Middle Eastern Studies. I suggest that you visit the Language Materials Project web site at: www.lmp.ucla.edu for more complete information. There are descriptions of these texts in the database. They can be ordered directly from the institutions, or you might want to contact Schoenhof's Foreign Books: http://www.schoenhofs.com/ , and order the books you want from them.\nDora\nWith little opportunity to practice, how do I maintain my listening/speaking skills in a language?\nDear Dora,\nI have studied and used Russian, German, and Arabic and now I am working in Washington and would like to keep up my skills with these languages. Like most people however, I don't have a lot of spare time to visit language labs or organize discussion groups.\nWhen at university I very much enjoyed the SCOLA programming system, which offered news programs from around the world, a different country each hour. This, at least, would help with listening skills, and provide a basis for mimicking pronunciations. I was wondering if there was any way for private homes to get the Scola link or a similar satellite or cable hookup, i.e. any hookup that would allow viewing of current foreign language TV programming. Thanks very much for any advice you can offer.\nHello!\nI believe SCOLA does indeed allow subscriptions to individuals but I have no idea what the subscription costs are. You might want to visit their Web site at http://www.scola.org for further information. I suspect you'll need to have access to some sort of satellite dish.\nThe other resource is to call the Voice of America and ask them for their schedules of broadcasting. What you should do is ask for the Russian language service, the German language service, etc. VOA is not allowed to broadcast to the U.S. since its mission is to make news available elsewhere, but there is nothing to preclude your getting a short wave radio and accessing the news broadcasts that way.\nTwo other resources that may be possibilities. I don't think there is a German language program in the area, but I won't swear to it. You might want to call the German Embassy and ask them if there are any broadcasts. There is a French radio one for example (about an hour or two a day). There is an Arabic language radio station and an Arabic language TV channel broadcast out of Northern Virginia. I think there is a Russian program broadcast out of Baltimore but I may be wrong. For Russian, I suggest you might want to contact Professor Rich Robin. He knows where all these resources are. His email is rrobin@gwu.edu (that's George Washington University).\nFinally, if you do want to spend a pleasant evening, there is an Inter-Cambio on Fridays or Saturdays at a funky cafe called Dos Gringos in the Mt. Pleasant area just north of Adams Morgan and easily accessible via public transportation. From the list I've seen, there is a fairly wide range of languages represented of people who want to engage in conversation. You may need to call Dos Gringos to find out what languages are being used by the patrons. The phone number is 202-462-1159.\nDora\nWhich types of people learn which foreign languages easily?\nDear Dora,\nI have a rather unusual question. I am a freshman in college and I am considering registering for a foreign language course next year. I am open to any language, but is it possible to identify which language I would be most equipped to understand before I make my decision? Has anyone ever created a test that determines what types of people learn which foreign language more easily? Given all people have unique talents and abilities, I'm assuming that some people can learn a particular foreign language more naturally than others. I already posed this question to my university's foreign language and linguistics departments, and they referred me to you.\nHello!\nTo my knowledge, there is no such test. There used to be one that tested for language learning ability called the MLAT but it has fallen out of favor. The going thinking in foreign language learning circles at the moment is that anyone can learn any language -- some obviously with a little more difficulty than others -- and the optimizing comes from good teaching and good materials.\nSo my advice to you is pick the language you think you would most enjoy learning. Perhaps you might want to look at the country, the culture -- is this a place you would really like to visit and spend time in? -- And ask former students what the instructor is like. I'd also be inclined to see what kinds of resources are available in the language-learning center (the old language labs) and what kind of assistance you can get. Good luck. I'm sorry I can't quite give you the predictable answer you are seeking!\n[Note: Since I answered this question, it has come to my attention that Second Language Testing, Inc. 10704 Mist Haven Terrace, N. Bethesda, MD 20852-3437, http://www.2lti.com/home2.htm , E-mail: CStansfield@2LTI.com is making available the MLAT. For further information about its availability and how to take it, contact SLTI directly.]\nDora\nI can hardly put together a sentence in Arabic without confusing my subject/verb agreement. Help!\nDear Dora,\nI am a first generation daughter that understands about 35% of the language (Arabic) and can hardly put a sentence together without confusing my subject/verb agreement. I am in the Detroit area and am looking for a school that teaches Arabic. Last summer I took a course at a local community college and learned nothing but the alphabet. My main goal is to speak Arabic fluently as a second language. I am finding it difficult to find an Arabic school that is not taught Islamically. If you have any suggestions please reply.\nHello!\nGosh, I don't really know what to say. I would agree with you that it is probably difficult in the Detroit area to find a school outside of the public schools that doesn't also teach Islamics along with the language. From a Muslim point of view, the two go hand in hand. And your story about only learning the alphabet is also a familiar story. I really don't quite know where to send you. I wonder whether you should consider starting out a little on your own and with someone who might be willing to work with you one on one until you feel like you can become part of a more advanced class.\nYou fit the profile of what we call a heritage language speaker. You have some knowledge of the language, and probably a lot of culture. So beginning classes can end up being very boring and not terribly useful. Yet, your command of the language does not give you access to a more advanced class because your proficiency is not good enough!\nIt also sounds as if you feel that the Islamic Arabic schools focus more on religion than they do on the language. Since I don't know them, passing judgment is not appropriate. However, I also think that this does have something to do with that middle ground of proficiency/lack of proficiency in a language.\nHave you looked into whether there are some full-fledged Arabic classes at Wayne State? I'm pretty sure there are. If you're willing to drive, the Univ. of Michigan in Ann Arbor has a wonderful Arabic program. You might want to give both departments a call and find out whether they have available resources that you can tap into. Then you might want to contact the head of the Arabic bilingual programs in the Detroit schools. My sense is that she would also know what might be a good school for you to attend.\nFinally, I'm assuming that you are interested in learning to speak Modern Standard Arabic as a second language. Because if you're interested in speaking one of the dialects, it's going to be a little bit harder to access resources. Your parents\u2044grandparents probably speak a dialect of Arabic, which is where your comprehension comes from and why you are having trouble with syntax if you're trying to speak MSA.\nThere are some good resources for learning Arabic now. I'm assuming that the language bookstore in Troy is still in existence. You might want to try them to see what is available that you can afford. You can also go to http://www.lmp.ucla.edu and search for Arabic. There is a fairly long list of different textbooks, including self-instructional ones that may be of interest to you. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. However, don't get discouraged. If you're determined, you will work something out!\nDora\nWhere can I study Magyar?\nDear Dora,\nI'm a biochemistry major. I've always been interested in linguistics and hope to pursue this route later. For the time being, I'm taking Japanese and German. I took French in high school--not exactly a 'rarely taught language.' My dad's family is Hungarian. As a small kid, I grew up hearing the language. I know some vocabulary and a little grammar, but could learn much more. As the older generations have passed away, there has been less and less chance to hear and practice the language. I've tried to teach myself Magyar and have met with limited success. As you know, it has one of the most difficult grammars to learn of any language.\nAs a non-Indo-European language, there are few cognates and so vocab acquisition is harder. (What knowledge of Magyar I have has helped with my Japanese though! crazy huh?) If I didn't have chemistry and biology to study and research in the lab, I could spend more time as an autodidact, but... and so I'd rather have some sort of organization. I'd like to learn it formally.\nI'd also like to get credit for my attempt. I need your advice. How should I approach the schools on the list about a possible correspondence course? Which school(s)? Summer school might also be an option, but I'd prefer a correspondence set-up.\nHello!\nI tip my hat to anyone who wants to take on Hungarian. I have a friend who has lived there now for almost 10 years and despite the fact that she's a good language learner, she says she still stumbles! The reason you probably had less trouble with Japanese because of your Hungarian is because (despite the heated debate) many linguists consider them Uralic languages -- so the structure of the languages are somewhat similar.\nOkay, on to where you can study it. Log on to http://carla.acad.umn.edu . Go to the less commonly taught languages icon and follow the trail from there for offerings in the LCTLs. Many of the schools offer independent study. Whether there is a way for any of these universities to allow you to get credit, I don't know.\nBeloit College does have an intensive summer program which may be your best bet. The contact information is all on the Web site. Ohio State University used to have a rudimentary distance-learning program where students enrolled and spent a certain number of hours being tutored via telephone. This was way before technologically savvy venues came about. I haven't heard anything about the program for a while, but you may want to contact the Slavic Dept. (also on the Web site) at OSU and ask them whether this still exists.\nFinally, I don't know if they would be of help to you or not, but you may want to talk to someone at NASILP (National Association of Self Instructional Programs) - http://www.nasilp.org . They may have some advice for you about what to do to get credit for independent study or from other institutions.\nOnce you've graduated and you think you won't object to working for the government, you should really look into the National Security Education Program. You just may be able to get yourself a scholarship that will get you to Hungary. This program is designed to encourage people in fields other than language to learn languages. Eastern Europe is not high on the list for obvious reasons, but Hungarian\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwell; you might be able to talk someone into it. There are also Fulbright scholarships that you can apply for. Combining your science and language is a wonderful idea. Good luck.\nDora\nWhich should I learn first Spanish or Portugese?\nDear Dora,\nI know Spain and Portugal are geographically close, but how similar are the two languages spoken there? I am interested in learning both Spanish and Portuguese, and am wondering if it is better to take one or the other first, to maximize the transfer from one language to learning the second.Thanks!\nHello!\nThe answer to your question as to whether Spanish and Portuguese are very similar is an unqualified yes. As to whether which language you should study first, it seems to me that either is a possibility. So I ran a small survey and talked to three people who had studied both languages and here are the results.\nTwo of them studied Spanish first. They then took a course called Portuguese for Spanish Speakers and they both thought it was a breeze in that they didn't have to struggle very hard. They found the grammar easy to understand. Both said that pronunciation was a little more complicated, but it didn't take much to figure things out. One person went to Brazil after she took the course and she said that at first she had to work hard to figure out the pronunciation, but within the month she was very comfortable with the language. She felt it didn't make a difference as to which language you studied first.\nThe second Spanish to Portuguese person spent more time in Europe. He listens to a lot of Brazilian music and finds it very easy to understand the lyrics. He did say that pronunciation would be a bit of an effort, but it is far easier to tune into Brazilian Portuguese if you know Spanish rather than tuning into Continental Portuguese. Portuguese has 7-8 vowels whereas Spanish has 5. He found that harder to understand although he could easily read the newspapers. This subject feels that it may be easier to study Spanish first. His experience was that Portuguese plurals, for example, were a bit arbitrary and knowing Spanish helps to figure them out.\nThe third person I interviewed studied Portuguese first, in middle school, and then learned Spanish beginning in 9th grade. She found the transition very easy to Spanish although writing was a bit of a hill to climb. She too thought that if you really had to make a choice, Spanish might be easier, although she didn't think it was all that much of a problem.\nThe final piece of information I have is from two Brazilian friends. One of them learned to speak Spanish very easily because her job took her to various Spanish speaking countries. She said it was a breeze. The other didn't learn to speak it but understands it very well. She attends Spanish-speaking conferences, for example. She noted one day, however, that Brazilians can understand Spanish, but Spanish speakers have trouble understanding Portuguese. When I checked this out with the other three subjects above, they agreed.\nSo, to sum up: the languages are very similar, and the main problem seems to come down to verbal comprehension. So you could start with one or the other, but it may be easier to start with Spanish. Please note, this advice is not based on scientific evidence! Good luck,\nDora\nWhere can my husband study Spanish in the Virginia-DC area?\nDear Dora,\nI am a native Spanish speaker while my husband is American. He has watched Muzzy and other programs, but what are some other ways for him to learn Spanish? We are in the Virginia area and have a young child who is also learning both languages. Thanks!\nHello!\nRegarding your husband learning Spanish, the options are many. I'm not quite sure exactly what you would like in terms of information. There are any number of options for him.\nIf he wants to learn it at home, you could perhaps buy a self-instructional course such as the Rosetta Stone. It moves the learner from the simple to the more difficult as the learner decides whether he\u2044she has control over what has been learned.\nThere are classes in the area that he could sign up for. No doubt the community colleges in the area offer Spanish and they're usually in the evenings because they cater to working adults. You would need to contact NOVA. The US Department of Agriculture Graduate School in Washington, DC also offers Spanish where the classes are also in the evenings.\nYou could also take on the task yourself and do a combination of contextualized learning (also with your child). E.g., you could spend half an hour every other day talking only Spanish. It's amazing how quickly he will pick up a whole bunch of language -- if he's motivated! And you can watch fun things like telenovelas with him. I understand that men love these more than women although they'd never admit to that. Or you could listen to/watch the news on one of the Spanish language channels.\nOf course, there's always tutoring, and an ad in the local community newsletter may produce more tutors than you know what to do with! The issue is whether you husband really wants to learn Spanish. If so, there are many opportunities. Good luck to him!\nDora\nWhere can I learn Uzbek and Persian Dari?\nDear Dora,\nI'm interested in learning Uzbek and Persian Dari. Do you offer these language courses? If so, can you send more information or direct me to where I can obtain more details.Thank you\nHello!\nI suggest you contact Indiana University for Uzbek. I don't know if they're planning on teaching Dari or not. They certainly are offering Pashto. The Slavic, East European and Central Asian Lanugages is sponsoring summer workshops on these languages. the URL is http://www.indiana.edu/~iuslavic/swseel . For more information on where Dari is being taught, you may also want to contact the Center for the Languages of the Central Asian Region: http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/ .\nDora\nHow to become fluent in Arabic?\nDear Dora,\nI am currently a senior at Ohio State, and my minor is in Arabic. I am interested in becoming fluent in Arabic, but find this a difficult task to achieve. What I have learned up to this point has certainly been helpful, but I'm looking for more of an intense program to learn Arabic. Of course I am aware of the Defense Language Institute in California that trains the military and agency members, but do you know of a similar program that is open to civilians? I appreciate whatever guidance you can give me.\nHello!\nThere are a couple of options, although the summer intensive program at Middlebury is full. If you want to go to another summer program, you might want to contact the Middlebury program and attend it next summer.\nThe other possibility is since you are a senior is for you to consider applying to the National Flagship Language Initiative program that's funded under the National Security Education Program, http://www.casl.umd.edu/nfli/ . The two Arabic programs that exist at the moment are at University of Maryland and Georgetown University and I understand that there are more planned. Dr. Mahdi Alosh at OSU can probably provide you with a fair amount of information about the programs since he has been involved in training and testing with them. You also may want to check out the Web site of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic. http://www.wm.edu/aata/ . There are intensive summer programs listed on that site which may be of use to you. Some depends on what kind of Arabic you want to work on. For example, this summer there an intensive Syrian Arabic course being taught at the University of Illinois--Urbana Champaign.\nDora\nBack to top\nCan I learn a language on my own?\nThis month, Craig Packard of The Center for Applied Linguistics will be a guest columnist filling in for Dora Johnson.\nDear Craig,\nPlease send me information regarding adults learning foreign languages linguistically on their own. Thanks,\nHello!\nHere are some ways to study--and to think about studying, whether via self-instructional tapes/CDs, distance ed. courses, Web sites, or on your own using some combination of the following tools and resources. I usually direct people--for starters--to our Resource Guide Online, \"Self-Directed Language Learning,\" which one may read at this URL: http://www.cal.org/resources/archive/rgos/selfdirected.html\nAs a reliable general rule, you'll make language learning progress faster and with greater accuracy if you work with a teacher who knows how to teach--knows how to teach both the target language itself and [this is important] how to apply your experience and adult brain power in the course of that language-learning process. There are several (learning and teaching) issues and different skills involved, so you may wish to concentrate on only speaking or only listening or both, or reading and writing--or all four. The choice and the plan of study depend on your goals. If it's particularly important to learn Mexican Spanish, for example, (as distinct from Castillian or Argentinian or Puerto Rican Spanish), then you must find yourself a native speaker of Mexican Spanish. The same applies to, let's say, Arabic, of which there are multiple dialects, or Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese dialects), and so forth.\nWe are able to offer some resources for self-guided language learning as an adult if you intend to do so on your own (without a teacher). It's important to point out that there are many ways to approach learning a language and learning particular language skills; there really is no such thing as one \"best\" course or approach that suits all people, all language-learning goals, all learning styles, all pocketbooks, and all time budgets (just for instance). Rather, there are several approaches (and combinations of approaches). Deciding which materials and approaches are appropriate for your situation and your language-learning goals--that's something you will need to do for yourself. We hesitate to recommend any particular software or Web site or class/program.\nWe hope that this helps you; feel free to contact us again if you have more questions.\nCraig\n"}, {"score": 1240.89, "uuid": "0626b11e-9f9b-5dab-827c-edde91a36f37", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0912wb-83-23324", "target_hostname": "www.nclrc.org", "target_uri": "http://www.nclrc.org/teachers_corner/languages_dora/learning_fl.html", "page_rank": 1.1943756e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "NCLRC | Teachers Corner | <em>Languages</em> - Ask Dora | <em>Learning</em> Foreing <em>Languages</em>", "snippet": "Please send me information regarding <em>adults</em> <em>learning</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>languages</em> linguistically on their own.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learning Chinese in Washington DC\nDear Dora,\nI am a recent college graduate in Washington, DC looking to begin studying Mandarin Chinese. Is there anywhere that I can get a list of programs for the area? I work on Capitol Hill.\nHello!\nFrom your e-mail I'm assuming that you are not interested in enrolling in a degree program, but are interested in working on the language. There are basically only two options that I know of, although sometimes university programs do offer language courses for non-degree applicants. The best and least expensive possibility is for you to contact the US Department of Agriculture Graduate School ( www.grad.usda.gov ),just down the street from you at 14th and Independence. They have several levels of course offerings, and my guess is that Chinese is one of the languages that they offer on a regular basis. The person to contact is Dr. Maria Wilmeth. The last phone number I have for her is 202-690-4724, and her e-mail is maria_wilmeth@grad.usda.gov .The other option is for you to contact one of the proprietary schools,of which there are many, for lessons. The advantage of proprietary schools is that they can tailor their teaching to your needs. The disadvantage is that they are more costly. For Chinese, I would say any of the larger schools such as Berlitz and Inlingua would do fine. Downtown, you might want to try the International Center for Language Studies on 15th Street, and in Arlington there is Diplomatic Language Services. These are but a few suggested names. There are many others.\nOf the universities, American University, Georgetown, George WashingtonUniversity, and Johns Hopkins University's Advanced International Studies in the District of Columbia offer Chinese. In Maryland, the closest is U of Maryland, College Park although UM BaltimoreCounty also offers it. It is highly possible that the University of Maryland University College also offers Chinese. UMUC is also involved in a fair amount of distance learning, but I haven't heard anything about their language programs in that area. The person to contact there is Dr. Lucinda Hart-Gonzalez. And in Virginia, the only institution I can find that offers Chinese that's within easy commuting distance is Northern Virginia Community College in Woodbridge. I hope this is of help.\nDora\nAt what age should I start to introduce my toddler to a second language, and how do I ensure there is no language confusion?\nDear Dora,\nI am learning French. My son is a year old. I was hoping when he is a little older and I am a little better at it, I could teach him/ learn with him. I have access to Sesame Street in French and other youth programs that would be perfect for both of us. So the question is, at what age should I start to introduce the second language? Also is there something special I should do to make sure he doesn't have language confusion? Everyone keeps telling me that I will confuse him and hurt his language skills, unless I speak French all the time, but this is not really an option.\nHello!\nThere is a fair amount of information on this topic, the bottom line being: don't listen to your well-meaning friends! There are some issues in early child language learning where you may have to make some choices. I am forwarding your question to Ingrid Pufahl who coordinates some of our (Center for Applied Linguistics) early foreign language learning information. She can send you a whole host of resources that you can use with your child, plus what are possible ways in which you can connect with other parents who find themselves in the same situation.\n*Ingrid Pufahl: I think it's a great idea to expose your child to another language. Probably at this time, your best bet would be to ask this question on our listserv. I know that one of our contributors is working on a book that is a resource guide for parents, showing ways to encourage their young children's foreign language learning. To ask this question, please go to www.cal.org/earlylang and follow the link on how to join \u00d1andu. You may also find other interesting information on this website. Also, depending on where you live, you may find a play group for your child that would support his French. Good luck.\nIngrid / Dora\nIs there a standard test for proficiency in Chinese?\nDear Dora,\nI'm a 2 year student of Chinese--including one year study abroad in China. I've been thinking about going into translating. Is there a standard test that's more or less internationally recognized that would give me an idea of my level of proficiency? I assume that I'd want to present the results of such a test to any potential employer whether they be Chinese or American.\nHello!\nI don't know if the American Translators Association ( www.atanet.org ) has devised an accreditation test in Chinese. My guess is that it has not. However, you need to contact them directly. If they don't offer the test, they may be able to provide you with a source that can help you. The last e-mail address for general inquiries I have is maggie@ata.net --the person is Maggie Row. If that doesn't work, the phone number is 703/683-6100. Address: 225 Reinekers Lane, Suite 590 Alexandria, VA 22314.\nAlthough many people successfully set up shop, and often there is no need to pass any particular test (at least in this country as of this date), becoming a good translator takes some training. You may want to check two schools that do offer this type of training. One is the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the other is the Monterey Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. Finally, you may also want to contact the Chinese Language Teachers Association . They do have a fairly complete Web site. The headquarters are at the University of Hawaii even though Ohio State hosts the Web site. This is the contact info: Chinese Language Teachers Association, Center for Chinese Studies, Moore Hall #416, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822. Tel: (808) 956-2692. Executive Director, Prof. Cynthia Ning, Email: cyndy@hawaii.edu . Good luck in your search.\nDora\nCan learning a secondary language as a young person have an impact on academic learning?\nDear Dora,\nI am in the middle of my research on learning secondary languages, specifically, \"Can learning a secondary language as a young person have an impact on academic learning?\" I have been having problems getting updated material, and I need to hear from other people or groups that have covered this area\nHello!\nThe ERIC Clearinghouse on Languages and Linguistics ( www.cal.org/ericcll ) has a fair amount of information on this topic. The Center for Applied Linguistics Web site also has information on the topic under the early language learning heading. You can also join the Nandu listserv ( www.cal.org/earlylang/ ), post your question on it, and will probably get more responses than you care to list! The Foreign Language Teaching Forum (FLTeach), http://www.cortland.edu/flteach is another good listserv.\nDora\nBack to top\nCould you recommend a good school for learning Arabic?\nDear Dora, I'm an adult who wants to learn Arabic. Could you recommend a fine, excellent school? Thank you.\nHello!\nWhere are you located? The programs at University of Michigan, Ohio State, Brigham Young, Middlebury, University of Georgia, Georgetown University, are possible places to get a good introduction to the language. The problem is whether they actually accept students for no credit during the school year. You'd have to check with them. Middlebury has a wonderful summer intensive program, and I believe Michigan and Georgetown also have summer programs.\nIf you are in the Washington, DC area, the Middle East Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Graduate School are the two places where Arabic is taught regularly for non-academic purposes.\nI suggest that you go to http://www.carla.acad.umn.edu/LCTL/ . There you will find the best list I know of where Arabic is taught, with contact information.\nDora\nWhat does a career in linguistics actually entail? Is it a rewarding career choice?\nDear Dora,\nI am curious as to what a career in linguistics would actually entail? I am unclear as to what it would be like to work as a professional in this capacity. I am only asking very basic questions since I am unaware in any regard what this career choice would be like, what opportunities are available for specializing, and finally what kind of a \"working life\" it provides. Is it rewarding on a personal, intellectual, and financial level? Does one feel like they have contributed at the end of the day, and is fairly compensated for that good work? Are fellow professionals interesting, challenging, and engaging? What opportunities are available for research, travel, and interesting life experiences?\nHello!\nLots of questions! I'm not quite sure whether we can satisfactorily answer all your questions since any career can take you into places you may or may not want to go, and you may end up working with people you like or don't like. And like most careers, there are days when you think you've done a lot of good and other days when you wonder what happened to the day!\nYou may want to go to www.cal.org/ericll and click on the Resource guides online icon and look for the guide on linguistics. This has a very short and very basic description of some of the various types of linguistics that one can specialize in.\nBeyond that, much depends on the kind of work you want to do. For example, there are linguists who labor mightily and hard in Native and Indigenous American languages in a real effort to revitalize them. This is tough work, but satisfying. That can take care of one's wanting to save the world feelings. There are linguists who do this all over the world -- endangered languages are a real issue. That would mean getting trained in formal linguistics so one knows what one is looking at.\nThere is work that you can do for the government. These days much of it entails language analysis, computational work, and translation (more than just one word at a time). Often these jobs require clearance. Generally, most of these jobs require actual language proficiency, particularly of those we call the less commonly taught languages (everything but French, Spanish, English, and German).\nThere is assessment work that you can think about. Measurement issues in language learning and teaching are big -- in fact, a real problem. With that, however, comes the need to also be trained in fundamental measurement and research methods. I would say that if you are trained in both, at least for the foreseeable future, you would not lack for work! Some of it can be mind numbing, but then most work has those aspects to it.\nThen there is teaching. This is probably the least available these days. There is a split between what it known as theoretical linguistics and applied linguistics. Most theoretical linguists toil in academia or in places like Microsoft. Applied linguists find themselves in a whole variety of places -- again in academia, but also in education and psychology, etc.\nAnd then there are things like forensic linguistics. And there are people who cross language and the law, language and medicine, language and (hard) science, language and anthropology, language and politics, language and public relations, language and advertising. The possibilities are endless!\nWhat I think is wonderful about linguistics is that its study touches on all aspects of life. As human beings, we are language bound, and consequently it affects everything that we process and that comes out of our mouths and is communicated by our bodies. Even if you don't end up \"doing linguistics\" in a formal way, its study it seems to me would enrich anything that you may end up doing. Good luck!\nDora\nWhat second language should I teach my child?\nHi Dora,\nI would like my children to start learning a foreign language. Trouble is I can't decide which one. My preference is for a language that is widely used, and easy to learn. Maybe Japanese, seeing as we live in Australia. Any advice is appreciated.\nHello!\nIt's a little difficult to pass on advice to you. My inclination is for you to introduce the children to one of the Pacific Rim languages. Obviously Japanese and Chinese are the two big ones, but Australia is involved with Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia -- any one of them would be useful to them later on, depending on what they want to be!\nNone of these languages are enormously easy to learn (although one could also say that of English if one were the speaker of these other languages!). But they can be fun depending on how it's taught. There are many programs for Japanese and Chinese now. I haven't seen anything for children in the other languages, but I would be willing to guess that there are some produced in Australia in the last 20 years since there has been so much emphasis on encouraging the learning of heritage languages as well as languages of the countries Australia is involved with. It would take some doing, but it seems to me that if all of you embarked on learning the rudiments of one of these languages then the children could go on once they enter school.\nI don't know where you live, but are you living in an area where there is a large group of immigrants (Greeks, Middle Easterners, Armenians)? If so, perhaps one possible introduction to a foreign language might be to investigate a Saturday school and send the children there if there are classes for them at that age.\nFinally, I suggest that you might want to contact Joe LoBianco at Language Australia in Canberra. He will be able to put you in touch with a teacher or group that can give you much better advice than we can from this distance.\nDora\nSo many languages, so many opportunities?\nDear Dora,\nMy query is in regards to choice of languages. I have good proficiency in French, Portuguese and Spanish. I now have an opportunity to study Russian, Chinese, German, Arabic or Italian. I love languages and they seem to come easily to me but I realize that I eventually have to earn a living. Where can one use this type of expertise? Do you have any suggestions?\nHello!\nThere are any number of ways in which one can earn one's living using languages, none of them easy! Much does depend, however, on your proficiency. \"Good proficiency\" needs to be quantified, and that's curiously harder to come by once you get to the very advanced levels. So once you know that you want to quantify your proficiency (as in what level you are), then you need to contact Language Testing International (LTI), Tel: 914-948-5100. There is a cost attached to the tests, but the effort may be worthwhile if you're planning to use your languages to earn some income.\nLTI, however, generally tests for speaking proficiency, not writing proficiency. For writing tests, you may want to check the Foreign Language Test Database maintained by the National Capital Language Resource Center and see what is available ( www.nclrc.org/fltestdb ) and contact the group that administers the test.\nThe largest consumer of foreign language expertise is the federal government. There are some 85 agencies that need language expertise of various types. They range from being a State Department escort (which means traveling with visitors) to working for the \"super secrets\" like the National Security Agency. Of course, the latter will require security clearance, which can take a long time.\nThere is also translation work. Being a good translator is hard work and takes a long time but if you are good at it, you will not lack for work. You will need to be certified, and that means going through the American Translators Association ( http://www.ata.org/ ). There are also private translation companies, many of whom are now going into computer-assisted translation. This is a growing field and you may want to investigate those companies. My guess is that those groups tend to need editors, but again your language skills will need to be quite advanced.\nYou can also teach. There are the private language schools. They don't pay well, and the benefits are lousy, but they are a place to get some experience. You can also consider teaching in the school system. Certified foreign language teachers with proficiency are in demand. There is a growing cadre of immersion and two-way language programs that are in need of good teachers. But that would mean you would have to put up with little or not-so-little kids!\nThen there is private industry. This is probably a more iffy area. Many industries tend to use in-country personnel to do their language work for them, but we have been told over and over again that when they do have people who speak the language of the country fluently, it makes a great deal of difference in the way business is conducted. You may want to contact your local university business school and ask to speak with the professor who is involved in international business. He/She might be able to put you in touch with a resource that's helpful. There are, incidentally, groups that specialize in communications that use foreign language. I'm afraid I can't give you the specific information, but I suspect once you start doing the research you'll find them. I hope this is helpful and will get you started.\nDora\nHow do I reaquaint myself with a language after minimal infrequent use?\nDear Dora,\nHelp! About twenty years ago, I could speak, write and read in Arabic, but now I can only understand it when it is spoken. What is the best way to pick it up again? Are there any books on the subject? Do I have to start over fresh? Thank you for your time.\nHello!\nHow does one advise another in such cases? I feel the same way! To think that I actually passed exams in Arabic many moons ago, I now stumble through many a conversation and have to concentrate very hard to read a newspaper!\nHowever, having said that, the general wisdom is that one never quite loses one's language, so that delving back into it is not such an ordeal. It depends on whether you want to refresh your language skills on your own or whether you want to do it somewhat more formally.\nIt seems to me less painful if you decided to \"start over fresh,\" as you put it. I don't think it would be a good idea for you to start at the beginning -- you will be amazed how much you probably have retained if you were educated in the language. I would enroll in essentially what is an intermediate level Arabic class if I felt my comprehension was high enough. Most likely, you will struggle for a few weeks trying to get some of the old grammar rules under control.\nIf your education consisted of informal exposure, then I'd be inclined to say that you may want to enroll in a beginning class. Some of the stuff will be old hat and boring, but teachers are usually willing to add more work for students who are a little more advanced than the rest of the class.\nI don't know where you live, but if you are in the Washington, DC area, the two places to check out are the US Department of Agriculture Graduate School and the Middle East Institute.\nIf you think you want to do this on your own, then I'd suggest that you go to the Language Materials Project database ( www.lmp.ucla.edu ) and look at the Modern Standard Arabic textbooks. There are a fair number on the market that have tapes/CDs, etc. attached to them, and you can pick the one that look like it might be what suits your learning style, and dive in.\nLanguage, like riding a bicycle, is not quite ever forgotten. It takes getting on it again and careening around a bit. But I think one can do it without encountering too many broken bones!\nDora\nHow do I go about teaching my child a second language?\nDear Dora,\nI am writing to you from a small town in New Zealand. We are interested in teaching our children a second language. Both my husband and I only speak English. We have recently bought a computer with the purpose of using it to teach our children.\nWe have contact with many overseas people - we traveled for a year on bicycle and now invite foreign cyclists into our home. Our 3 year old seems very bright (not just to us), she also has the ability to sit for long periods of time, and we would like to make the most of her enthusiasm for learning.\nHello!\nThere are quite a number of early childhood foreign language programs now available. We are not equipped to evaluate them, so I suggest that you contact the National Foreign Language Resource Center at the address below. Their focus is on K-12, but I'm sure they also are collecting information on earlier years. You may also want to ask the Center about the guidelines they use when evaluating foreign language materials.\nThe National Foreign Language Resource Center at Iowa State University - http://www.nflrc.iastate.edu/homepage.html : This center focuses on improving student learning of foreign languages in Grades K-12. The center's work is focused on the use of effective teaching strategies, administration and interpretation of foreign language performance assessments, and the use of new technologies in the foreign language classroom.\nAnother resource is http://www.cal.org/earlylang , which focuses on early language learning issues in grades K-8. You could look into joining the electronic mailing list for school district personnel, superintendents, teachers, college and university teacher educators, and parents. It is sponsored by the Improving Foreign Language Instruction project of the Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory at Brown University (LAB), and funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\nIt sounds like your little girl has a wonderful, bright future ahead. Best wishes!\nDora\nDoes learning a second language enhance my marketability?\nDear Dora,\nI am a junior in high school who is studying Spanish and French and planning to major in Spanish in college. I was told by a friend in college that if I major in language, it would open many opportunities for me. Is it true?\nHello!\nLearning another language is always advantageous! I think you need to think about what you see yourself doing once you get out of college. There is no doubt that in the foreseeable future, being fluent in Spanish will give you opportunities in the social services and health fields, in teaching, and in business. French perhaps, may be not so immediately useful on this side of the Atlantic, but it certainly would be very useful if you are thinking about going into international work since there are still large areas of the world where French continues to play an important role and as people take it less and less there will probably be a shortage. There is a shortage of French teachers here, for example.\nIf you are willing to undergo the rigorous training of becoming an interpreter (and it is rigorous!), there are also many opportunities in that field. Good interpreters are always in demand according to those in the know. If nothing else, being fluent in a language opens up all sorts of wonderful doors - for your own personal satisfaction. I am sure you are already finding out how wonderful it is to be able to converse in another language. Keep it up! Then combine it with something you think you want to do in college and you surely will come out ahead!\nDora\nHow do I teach my three year old nephew Spanish?\nDear Dora,\nI am trying to teach my 3.5 year old nephew to speak Spanish. Any thoughts on how to go about this?\nHello!\nThere are a number of resources in various places on our Web site ( http://www.cal.org ). Plug in Early Language Learning and I think you'll find a fair number of publications that will give you a sense of what directions to take.\nYou may also want to join the \u00f1anduti electronic mailing list , which you can do through this site: http://www.cal.org/earlylang/ . Posting your question will probably bring you more answers than you want, but it's a good place to elicit responses from parents and teachers. For example, at one point there was a lot of discussion about the use of video in language teaching/learning. Parents and teachers have shared what they do with their pre-K to higher elementary school students. What they use, what approaches they use, the \"tricks of the trade\", etc.\nIf none of this proves satisfactory, contact Nancy Rhodes ( nancy@cal.org ) and she can put you in touch with a couple of people who can give you more detailed information.\nDora\nWhich of these languages: Russian Korean, Hindi, is the most difficult to learn from the viewpoint of an American speaker?\nDear Dora,\nI am interested in learning Russian, Korean, or Hindi. Since learning a language is a long-term, intensive investment of time, money, interest, etc., I want to make the right choice now. My question is: which language should I learn?\nI use Spanish and Portuguese daily at work and in my family and social life. (I am also familiar with French and Latin). For years, I was a Spanish and English, ESL and American Literature instructor. Consequently, I am fully familiar with the techniques and trials of learning a foreign language and grammatical terms and explanations do not confuse or overwhelm me.\nI live in a cosmopolitan area, so I know that I could practice all three if I made the effort. Moreover, I have access to magazines, cassettes, and books in all three languages. So that is not an issue either. My primary reason for learning one of these three languages is simply self-improvement and a personal interest in foreign language acquisition.\nPronunciation is probably the greatest single factor in my making a decision followed by grammatical and syntactical difficulty. Which of the three languages-Russian, Korean, and Hindi-would you say is the easiest to pronounce and which is the most difficult from the standpoint of an American speaker? Is Korean a tonal language as many other Asian tongues are?\nHello!\nYou have a bit of a tall order and I'm not sure that we could answer your needs in any satisfactory manner. In your case, it's a matter of choice, rather than job-related or a matter of survival!\nKorean is not a tonal language so that is not a problem. If you are able to figure out Korean writing, I don't think you'd have that much trouble with Hindi either. Think of the writing system as a laundry line with symbols hanging off it. According to a Russian expert who recently conducted workshops for a project related to the National Capital Language Resource Center (NCLRC), Russian is about as straightforward a language as one can get. The alphabet is easy to learn (what you see is what you get), and there is little variation in dialects. But like most languages, as you know, once one gets beyond a certain level, communication takes on much more complicated set of nuances.\nIt seems to me that you may want to make your decision based on what you want to use the language for. If you're only going to learn it for the fun of it and not use it a whole lot as you seem to do with your other languages, then it seems to me, you should make the decision based on how much of the literature, the newspapers, the news (via satellite), etc. you are going to indulge in. Pronunciation might take a back seat in that case -- and comprehension and listening and reading skills would be more important. If you think you are going to be interacting with people from the language group, then pronunciation obviously will be an important factor . Then you would need to decide whether you want to go simple (Russian) or difficult (Hindi). My guess is that Korean falls in the middle, if such a thing can be measured.\nWhat I think might be the best thing is for you to perhaps go to one of the university libraries that have linguistics programs, and look for a volume called The World's Major Languages, ed. by Bernard Comrie. There are good understandable descriptions of the phonologies for each of these languages in the book and you might be able to compare them and make an informed judgment based on your needs and interests.\nDora\nBeginning level Demotiki. Help!\nDear Dora,\nI am interested in Greek language study, Demotiki, especially conversation. I have had some lessons in the language, and am probably at the beginner/tourist level. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\nHello!\nI am not quite sure whether you are interested in taking classes or whether you are interested in going it alone. For information about materials you will need to search on the Language Materials Project. Go to http://www.lmp.ucla.edu .\nIf it's classes, your choices may be somewhat limited. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School sometimes offers Greek, if there are enough students to make up a class. Contact Maria Wilmeth at 202/690-4724 or e-mail: MWilmeth@smtpgate.grad.usda.gov . The Greek church on 16th Street has also been known to offer classes although I haven't been in contact with them in quite a while. Whether they are continuing or not, I don't know, but you could give them a call. And of course there are the proprietary schools which are more costly, but are also able to tailor classes to your needs. One school is the International Center for Language Studies on 15th Street, NW. Phone number is 202/639-8800. You could try asking for Vesna Putic Other schools are Berlitz, Inlingua, and Diplomatic Language Services although there are a number of others in the area. The Yellow Pages are one place to start.\nFinally, the person who knows where all the resources are is Dr. James E. Alatis at Georgetown University. Summertime may be a hard time to get him, but you could try calling his office at 202/687-5659. His assistant will know how you can reach him. Who knows, maybe he'll let you sit in on his classes!\nDora\nHelp! Only six months to learn Moroccan Arabic before leaving on holiday!\nDear Dora,\nI am going to Morocco in a couple of months. I need to learn the commonly spoken dialect. I understand it is a mix of many languages! If you can provide me with assistance on how to go about learning this dialect, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\nHello!\nFor some curious reason, to my knowledge, new Moroccan Arabic textbooks have not been issued recently. The ones I know of are from the 60s and the 70s. They're quite adequate, but with the exception of a couple of French books and the Lonely Planet phrase book, the only two sets of books I know of are those produced by Georgetown University Press and the University of Michigan Dept. of Middle Eastern Studies. I suggest that you visit the Language Materials Project web site at: www.lmp.ucla.edu for more complete information. There are descriptions of these texts in the database. They can be ordered directly from the institutions, or you might want to contact Schoenhof's Foreign Books: http://www.schoenhofs.com/ , and order the books you want from them.\nDora\nWith little opportunity to practice, how do I maintain my listening/speaking skills in a language?\nDear Dora,\nI have studied and used Russian, German, and Arabic and now I am working in Washington and would like to keep up my skills with these languages. Like most people however, I don't have a lot of spare time to visit language labs or organize discussion groups.\nWhen at university I very much enjoyed the SCOLA programming system, which offered news programs from around the world, a different country each hour. This, at least, would help with listening skills, and provide a basis for mimicking pronunciations. I was wondering if there was any way for private homes to get the Scola link or a similar satellite or cable hookup, i.e. any hookup that would allow viewing of current foreign language TV programming. Thanks very much for any advice you can offer.\nHello!\nI believe SCOLA does indeed allow subscriptions to individuals but I have no idea what the subscription costs are. You might want to visit their Web site at http://www.scola.org for further information. I suspect you'll need to have access to some sort of satellite dish.\nThe other resource is to call the Voice of America and ask them for their schedules of broadcasting. What you should do is ask for the Russian language service, the German language service, etc. VOA is not allowed to broadcast to the U.S. since its mission is to make news available elsewhere, but there is nothing to preclude your getting a short wave radio and accessing the news broadcasts that way.\nTwo other resources that may be possibilities. I don't think there is a German language program in the area, but I won't swear to it. You might want to call the German Embassy and ask them if there are any broadcasts. There is a French radio one for example (about an hour or two a day). There is an Arabic language radio station and an Arabic language TV channel broadcast out of Northern Virginia. I think there is a Russian program broadcast out of Baltimore but I may be wrong. For Russian, I suggest you might want to contact Professor Rich Robin. He knows where all these resources are. His email is rrobin@gwu.edu (that's George Washington University).\nFinally, if you do want to spend a pleasant evening, there is an Inter-Cambio on Fridays or Saturdays at a funky cafe called Dos Gringos in the Mt. Pleasant area just north of Adams Morgan and easily accessible via public transportation. From the list I've seen, there is a fairly wide range of languages represented of people who want to engage in conversation. You may need to call Dos Gringos to find out what languages are being used by the patrons. The phone number is 202-462-1159.\nDora\nWhich types of people learn which foreign languages easily?\nDear Dora,\nI have a rather unusual question. I am a freshman in college and I am considering registering for a foreign language course next year. I am open to any language, but is it possible to identify which language I would be most equipped to understand before I make my decision? Has anyone ever created a test that determines what types of people learn which foreign language more easily? Given all people have unique talents and abilities, I'm assuming that some people can learn a particular foreign language more naturally than others. I already posed this question to my university's foreign language and linguistics departments, and they referred me to you.\nHello!\nTo my knowledge, there is no such test. There used to be one that tested for language learning ability called the MLAT but it has fallen out of favor. The going thinking in foreign language learning circles at the moment is that anyone can learn any language -- some obviously with a little more difficulty than others -- and the optimizing comes from good teaching and good materials.\nSo my advice to you is pick the language you think you would most enjoy learning. Perhaps you might want to look at the country, the culture -- is this a place you would really like to visit and spend time in? -- And ask former students what the instructor is like. I'd also be inclined to see what kinds of resources are available in the language-learning center (the old language labs) and what kind of assistance you can get. Good luck. I'm sorry I can't quite give you the predictable answer you are seeking!\n[Note: Since I answered this question, it has come to my attention that Second Language Testing, Inc. 10704 Mist Haven Terrace, N. Bethesda, MD 20852-3437, http://www.2lti.com/home2.htm , E-mail: CStansfield@2LTI.com is making available the MLAT. For further information about its availability and how to take it, contact SLTI directly.]\nDora\nI can hardly put together a sentence in Arabic without confusing my subject/verb agreement. Help!\nDear Dora,\nI am a first generation daughter that understands about 35% of the language (Arabic) and can hardly put a sentence together without confusing my subject/verb agreement. I am in the Detroit area and am looking for a school that teaches Arabic. Last summer I took a course at a local community college and learned nothing but the alphabet. My main goal is to speak Arabic fluently as a second language. I am finding it difficult to find an Arabic school that is not taught Islamically. If you have any suggestions please reply.\nHello!\nGosh, I don't really know what to say. I would agree with you that it is probably difficult in the Detroit area to find a school outside of the public schools that doesn't also teach Islamics along with the language. From a Muslim point of view, the two go hand in hand. And your story about only learning the alphabet is also a familiar story. I really don't quite know where to send you. I wonder whether you should consider starting out a little on your own and with someone who might be willing to work with you one on one until you feel like you can become part of a more advanced class.\nYou fit the profile of what we call a heritage language speaker. You have some knowledge of the language, and probably a lot of culture. So beginning classes can end up being very boring and not terribly useful. Yet, your command of the language does not give you access to a more advanced class because your proficiency is not good enough!\nIt also sounds as if you feel that the Islamic Arabic schools focus more on religion than they do on the language. Since I don't know them, passing judgment is not appropriate. However, I also think that this does have something to do with that middle ground of proficiency/lack of proficiency in a language.\nHave you looked into whether there are some full-fledged Arabic classes at Wayne State? I'm pretty sure there are. If you're willing to drive, the Univ. of Michigan in Ann Arbor has a wonderful Arabic program. You might want to give both departments a call and find out whether they have available resources that you can tap into. Then you might want to contact the head of the Arabic bilingual programs in the Detroit schools. My sense is that she would also know what might be a good school for you to attend.\nFinally, I'm assuming that you are interested in learning to speak Modern Standard Arabic as a second language. Because if you're interested in speaking one of the dialects, it's going to be a little bit harder to access resources. Your parents\u2044grandparents probably speak a dialect of Arabic, which is where your comprehension comes from and why you are having trouble with syntax if you're trying to speak MSA.\nThere are some good resources for learning Arabic now. I'm assuming that the language bookstore in Troy is still in existence. You might want to try them to see what is available that you can afford. You can also go to http://www.lmp.ucla.edu and search for Arabic. There is a fairly long list of different textbooks, including self-instructional ones that may be of interest to you. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. However, don't get discouraged. If you're determined, you will work something out!\nDora\nWhere can I study Magyar?\nDear Dora,\nI'm a biochemistry major. I've always been interested in linguistics and hope to pursue this route later. For the time being, I'm taking Japanese and German. I took French in high school--not exactly a 'rarely taught language.' My dad's family is Hungarian. As a small kid, I grew up hearing the language. I know some vocabulary and a little grammar, but could learn much more. As the older generations have passed away, there has been less and less chance to hear and practice the language. I've tried to teach myself Magyar and have met with limited success. As you know, it has one of the most difficult grammars to learn of any language.\nAs a non-Indo-European language, there are few cognates and so vocab acquisition is harder. (What knowledge of Magyar I have has helped with my Japanese though! crazy huh?) If I didn't have chemistry and biology to study and research in the lab, I could spend more time as an autodidact, but... and so I'd rather have some sort of organization. I'd like to learn it formally.\nI'd also like to get credit for my attempt. I need your advice. How should I approach the schools on the list about a possible correspondence course? Which school(s)? Summer school might also be an option, but I'd prefer a correspondence set-up.\nHello!\nI tip my hat to anyone who wants to take on Hungarian. I have a friend who has lived there now for almost 10 years and despite the fact that she's a good language learner, she says she still stumbles! The reason you probably had less trouble with Japanese because of your Hungarian is because (despite the heated debate) many linguists consider them Uralic languages -- so the structure of the languages are somewhat similar.\nOkay, on to where you can study it. Log on to http://carla.acad.umn.edu . Go to the less commonly taught languages icon and follow the trail from there for offerings in the LCTLs. Many of the schools offer independent study. Whether there is a way for any of these universities to allow you to get credit, I don't know.\nBeloit College does have an intensive summer program which may be your best bet. The contact information is all on the Web site. Ohio State University used to have a rudimentary distance-learning program where students enrolled and spent a certain number of hours being tutored via telephone. This was way before technologically savvy venues came about. I haven't heard anything about the program for a while, but you may want to contact the Slavic Dept. (also on the Web site) at OSU and ask them whether this still exists.\nFinally, I don't know if they would be of help to you or not, but you may want to talk to someone at NASILP (National Association of Self Instructional Programs) - http://www.nasilp.org . They may have some advice for you about what to do to get credit for independent study or from other institutions.\nOnce you've graduated and you think you won't object to working for the government, you should really look into the National Security Education Program. You just may be able to get yourself a scholarship that will get you to Hungary. This program is designed to encourage people in fields other than language to learn languages. Eastern Europe is not high on the list for obvious reasons, but Hungarian\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwell; you might be able to talk someone into it. There are also Fulbright scholarships that you can apply for. Combining your science and language is a wonderful idea. Good luck.\nDora\nWhich should I learn first Spanish or Portugese?\nDear Dora,\nI know Spain and Portugal are geographically close, but how similar are the two languages spoken there? I am interested in learning both Spanish and Portuguese, and am wondering if it is better to take one or the other first, to maximize the transfer from one language to learning the second.Thanks!\nHello!\nThe answer to your question as to whether Spanish and Portuguese are very similar is an unqualified yes. As to whether which language you should study first, it seems to me that either is a possibility. So I ran a small survey and talked to three people who had studied both languages and here are the results.\nTwo of them studied Spanish first. They then took a course called Portuguese for Spanish Speakers and they both thought it was a breeze in that they didn't have to struggle very hard. They found the grammar easy to understand. Both said that pronunciation was a little more complicated, but it didn't take much to figure things out. One person went to Brazil after she took the course and she said that at first she had to work hard to figure out the pronunciation, but within the month she was very comfortable with the language. She felt it didn't make a difference as to which language you studied first.\nThe second Spanish to Portuguese person spent more time in Europe. He listens to a lot of Brazilian music and finds it very easy to understand the lyrics. He did say that pronunciation would be a bit of an effort, but it is far easier to tune into Brazilian Portuguese if you know Spanish rather than tuning into Continental Portuguese. Portuguese has 7-8 vowels whereas Spanish has 5. He found that harder to understand although he could easily read the newspapers. This subject feels that it may be easier to study Spanish first. His experience was that Portuguese plurals, for example, were a bit arbitrary and knowing Spanish helps to figure them out.\nThe third person I interviewed studied Portuguese first, in middle school, and then learned Spanish beginning in 9th grade. She found the transition very easy to Spanish although writing was a bit of a hill to climb. She too thought that if you really had to make a choice, Spanish might be easier, although she didn't think it was all that much of a problem.\nThe final piece of information I have is from two Brazilian friends. One of them learned to speak Spanish very easily because her job took her to various Spanish speaking countries. She said it was a breeze. The other didn't learn to speak it but understands it very well. She attends Spanish-speaking conferences, for example. She noted one day, however, that Brazilians can understand Spanish, but Spanish speakers have trouble understanding Portuguese. When I checked this out with the other three subjects above, they agreed.\nSo, to sum up: the languages are very similar, and the main problem seems to come down to verbal comprehension. So you could start with one or the other, but it may be easier to start with Spanish. Please note, this advice is not based on scientific evidence! Good luck,\nDora\nWhere can my husband study Spanish in the Virginia-DC area?\nDear Dora,\nI am a native Spanish speaker while my husband is American. He has watched Muzzy and other programs, but what are some other ways for him to learn Spanish? We are in the Virginia area and have a young child who is also learning both languages. Thanks!\nHello!\nRegarding your husband learning Spanish, the options are many. I'm not quite sure exactly what you would like in terms of information. There are any number of options for him.\nIf he wants to learn it at home, you could perhaps buy a self-instructional course such as the Rosetta Stone. It moves the learner from the simple to the more difficult as the learner decides whether he\u2044she has control over what has been learned.\nThere are classes in the area that he could sign up for. No doubt the community colleges in the area offer Spanish and they're usually in the evenings because they cater to working adults. You would need to contact NOVA. The US Department of Agriculture Graduate School in Washington, DC also offers Spanish where the classes are also in the evenings.\nYou could also take on the task yourself and do a combination of contextualized learning (also with your child). E.g., you could spend half an hour every other day talking only Spanish. It's amazing how quickly he will pick up a whole bunch of language -- if he's motivated! And you can watch fun things like telenovelas with him. I understand that men love these more than women although they'd never admit to that. Or you could listen to/watch the news on one of the Spanish language channels.\nOf course, there's always tutoring, and an ad in the local community newsletter may produce more tutors than you know what to do with! The issue is whether you husband really wants to learn Spanish. If so, there are many opportunities. Good luck to him!\nDora\nWhere can I learn Uzbek and Persian Dari?\nDear Dora,\nI'm interested in learning Uzbek and Persian Dari. Do you offer these language courses? If so, can you send more information or direct me to where I can obtain more details.Thank you\nHello!\nI suggest you contact Indiana University for Uzbek. I don't know if they're planning on teaching Dari or not. They certainly are offering Pashto. The Slavic, East European and Central Asian Lanugages is sponsoring summer workshops on these languages. the URL is http://www.indiana.edu/~iuslavic/swseel . For more information on where Dari is being taught, you may also want to contact the Center for the Languages of the Central Asian Region: http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/ .\nDora\nHow to become fluent in Arabic?\nDear Dora,\nI am currently a senior at Ohio State, and my minor is in Arabic. I am interested in becoming fluent in Arabic, but find this a difficult task to achieve. What I have learned up to this point has certainly been helpful, but I'm looking for more of an intense program to learn Arabic. Of course I am aware of the Defense Language Institute in California that trains the military and agency members, but do you know of a similar program that is open to civilians? I appreciate whatever guidance you can give me.\nHello!\nThere are a couple of options, although the summer intensive program at Middlebury is full. If you want to go to another summer program, you might want to contact the Middlebury program and attend it next summer.\nThe other possibility is since you are a senior is for you to consider applying to the National Flagship Language Initiative program that's funded under the National Security Education Program, http://www.casl.umd.edu/nfli/ . The two Arabic programs that exist at the moment are at University of Maryland and Georgetown University and I understand that there are more planned. Dr. Mahdi Alosh at OSU can probably provide you with a fair amount of information about the programs since he has been involved in training and testing with them. You also may want to check out the Web site of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic. http://www.wm.edu/aata/ . There are intensive summer programs listed on that site which may be of use to you. Some depends on what kind of Arabic you want to work on. For example, this summer there an intensive Syrian Arabic course being taught at the University of Illinois--Urbana Champaign.\nDora\nBack to top\nCan I learn a language on my own?\nThis month, Craig Packard of The Center for Applied Linguistics will be a guest columnist filling in for Dora Johnson.\nDear Craig,\nPlease send me information regarding adults learning foreign languages linguistically on their own. Thanks,\nHello!\nHere are some ways to study--and to think about studying, whether via self-instructional tapes/CDs, distance ed. courses, Web sites, or on your own using some combination of the following tools and resources. I usually direct people--for starters--to our Resource Guide Online, \"Self-Directed Language Learning,\" which one may read at this URL: http://www.cal.org/resources/archive/rgos/selfdirected.html\nAs a reliable general rule, you'll make language learning progress faster and with greater accuracy if you work with a teacher who knows how to teach--knows how to teach both the target language itself and [this is important] how to apply your experience and adult brain power in the course of that language-learning process. There are several (learning and teaching) issues and different skills involved, so you may wish to concentrate on only speaking or only listening or both, or reading and writing--or all four. The choice and the plan of study depend on your goals. If it's particularly important to learn Mexican Spanish, for example, (as distinct from Castillian or Argentinian or Puerto Rican Spanish), then you must find yourself a native speaker of Mexican Spanish. The same applies to, let's say, Arabic, of which there are multiple dialects, or Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese dialects), and so forth.\nWe are able to offer some resources for self-guided language learning as an adult if you intend to do so on your own (without a teacher). It's important to point out that there are many ways to approach learning a language and learning particular language skills; there really is no such thing as one \"best\" course or approach that suits all people, all language-learning goals, all learning styles, all pocketbooks, and all time budgets (just for instance).

A new foreign language can be difficult to learn, and linguists agree. Here are some tips to stay motivated.\nRelated Articles\nExpat children and language learning\nSteven Pinker, for one, thinks the \u201clanguage instinct\u201d is lost somewhere around puberty. Children are linguistic geniuses, adults linguistic dolts. Pinker points out that Walter Kissinger (Henry\u2019s younger brother) has no German accent, though sixty years after his emigration, Henry famously does.\nThey came to the United States at the same time, in the crucial years around puberty. Walter\u2019s advantage, Pinker surmises, was being a few years younger than his brother when they moved. This allowed him to absorb more English and kick his accent. (According to Pinker, the accent is as much a part of the language instinct as\u00a0is grammar.)\nLearning a language in adulthood is difficult\u2014nothing can replace the childhood environment, much less the childhood brain. However, with patience and persistence, it can be done. To produce a foreign language requires more than lips, teeth and tongue\u2014it requires ears, eyes and mental agility. You must listen carefully and then imitate.\nLanguage is like jazz: both are spontaneous compositions derived from a finite set of elements (notes or words). But the jazz analogy may compel people to think that they simply don\u2019t have the talent. What they don\u2019t realize is how obsessively John Coltrane practiced, repeating scales and arpeggios over and over again to build up the skills he would need to make that freeform composition on the stage seem so effortless.\nIt is exactly the same way when composing a foreign language.\nI\u2019ve learned Spanish, German, French, Portuguese and Russian\u2014all post-puberty. And recently, I started Arabic\u2014by far the hardest language I\u2019ve studied. Though I was frustrated at first, now that I have a better teacher and a good textbook, I\u2019m making rapid progress. Every student of language is different, but here are some strategies that have helped me:\nSlow and steady\nRegular practice is by far the most important element in learning a language. Students often try to cram as much into their heads as fast as they can which leads to frustration and fatigue. If taking a class, they are exposed to the language only one to three times a week, plus the time they spend on homework.\nIt is far more helpful to spend five minutes twice a day, every day, thinking, reading and talking in the language. Where and when, though? As you learn, practice out loud whenever you are alone. While you walk to the train station, or sit in stop-and-go traffic, review to yourself. Start simple: \u201cI go to work. I am in the car. I live in New York.\u201d Repeat these basics over and over, and then vary the subject. \u201cSteve goes to work. Steve is in his car. Steve lives in New York.\u201d\nRepeat, repeat, repeat. You will then feel a thrill as you proceed to compound sentences, tenses, and modal verbs (should, would, must, may). \u201cI am going to work, because I have to. I live in New York, and I love it here.\u201d Those steps beyond baby talk are exciting.\nTake a class\nIf you live in any medium-sized city, a foreign-language class is not hard to find. If you are in a big city, you will be spoiled for choice. New York University, for example, offers dozens of classes in a wide variety of languages from Norwegian to Yiddish to Persian, for around USD450 a semester.\nAttending a class is the single best way to motivate yourself\u2014the desire to impress a teacher and classmates will help keep you on task. If you have the means to get a private tutor, even better. But be sure to get a recommendation from a knowledgeable friend\u2014not every native speaker is a good teacher.\n(Illustration above by Markus )\nTeach yourself\nLearning a foreign language all by yourself is extremely difficult\u2014and probably not a good idea if it\u2019s your first one. However, if you decide to go the autodidact route, make sure to buy top-notch books, audio CDs, and computer programs.\nA good book can get you far in a language with an easy spelling system, like Spanish or Italian. I\u2019ve found Routledge\u2019s \u201cColloquial\u201d series to be fairly good. But for languages with irregular spelling (French or Danish, say), or unfamiliar sounds (Chinese or Hindi), it\u2019s better to get a book that comes with audio CDs. The \u201cUltimate\u201d series from Random House has a straightforward, building-block structure, with practical vocabulary and lucid explanations.\nComputer software has something to offer as well. But don\u2019t expect miraculous results. I reviewed the Danish version of the widely marketed Rosetta Stone series here. Short version: you will learn grammar and vocabulary surprisingly quickly with this novel (and expensive) software, but you won\u2019t learn practical stuff at all.\nWhile focusing on grammar building blocks, the program sacrifices basic elements of conversation such as \u201chello\u201d or \u201cmy name is\u201d or \u201chelp!\u201d Though you\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cThere is not an elephant under the airplane,\u201d I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever have a reason to use this sentence in daily conversation.\nRosetta Stone has another drawback. Each lesson is structured exactly the same\u2014identical exercises in the same order. This is bad practice\u2014different languages pose different challenges. Also, many languages have structures Rosetta Stone isn\u2019t equipped to teach: the Arabic dual number (words have singular, dual and plural endings), the Russian verbal aspect system, the Spanish subjunctive and so forth are all distinctive. Rosetta\u2019s software does not address any of these eccentricities.\nSurround yourself\nWhenever possible, bring the language into your immediate world. The \u201c10 Minutes a Day\u201d series of books is generally useless, as if written for not particularly bright six-year-olds, but they do come with small stickers you can attach to items all around your house. This is an excellent vocabulary-building technique. If every time you reach for your coffee mug you see chashka (Russian for cup) and you say the word to yourself, it will stick in your head.\nNearly every language in the world can be found on the Internet. The BBC, in fact, broadcasts everything from Spanish to Bengali. (You can check out their 33-language menu here).\nAs you potter around the house, listen to the day\u2019s news in your language of choice. You don\u2019t need to understand everything, but this will both help you feel the rhythm and become accustomed to the accent. You\u2019ll get a crucial psychological boost when you can make out a few words, then phrases and sentences, in a row. Do this every few days and you\u2019ll be surprised by your progress.\nRead\nBBC.com also has written material that you can practice with. The news stories in each of those 33 languages are written in a clear, simple style for a worldwide audience. When you\u2019re ready, try to read a news story a week, especially about something you\u2019re familiar with.\nThis is crucial\u2014reading an article about unfamiliar material is distressingly complex. But if you know the subject, it can be pleasantly easy, since you\u2019ll be able to guess many unfamiliar words. You\u2019ll need to start out with a dictionary, but once you learn frequently-used words, you\u2019ll be able to go without it and guess most of the things you don\u2019t know.\nYou can also read books that have been translated from English into your chosen language\u2014all the better if it\u2019s a book you know. I have a copy of Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity in German, for example. Hornby\u2019s clear English is translated into similarly clear German, without some of the convoluted sentence structures many native Germans use. I know the original book and movie, so I myself can zip through it.\nWhen you are ready to move to the next level and read unfamiliar books in this language, ask a native which authors write in an easy, clear style. If you were helping a foreigner try to learn English, for example, you would suggest Hemingway, not David Foster Wallace. Similarly, someone learning German would do well to start with Kafka rather than Thomas Mann.\nFind a friend who speaks the language\nThis is obvious, but practice with a native speaker is enormously helpful. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a good friend who is a native speaker\u2014or best of all, a girlfriend/boyfriend or housemate (someone you see all the time)\u2014take advantage of him or her. Don\u2019t wait until you feel totally comfortable, or you\u2019ll never start. Make it fun, make it a routine, and do so early.\nRelax\nThe biggest hurdle to learning a language is psychological. If you\u2019re nervous about blundering through a new language in front of strangers, the best way to relax is to start slowly. At a local coffee shop staffed exclusively by young Polish blondes, I take my muffin and coffee away with a \u201cdziekuje.\u201d (Thank-you.)\nMy pronunciation isn\u2019t perfect, but it never fails to win a slightly surprised smile. Next step? I\u2019ll order the coffee in Polish, too. Then, I\u2019ll try \u201cgoodbye.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re ready and have the chance, smile and try speaking with your teacher in the corridor, your cute Russian co-worker, the man who sells you cigarettes, or the waiter at your favorite restaurant. See that grin? Most people love to see you make the effort, and they will be happy to see you break out new vocabulary and longer sentences.\nIf you kick yourself for every little slip-up (and you\u2019ll make many), you\u2019ll never progress. If you relax, simply communicate, and most of all enjoy, you can, with patience and effort, learn any language you want.\nBy Robert Lane Greene*\n*Lane Greene is an international correspondent for The Economist: he writes on American foreign policy and international politics for www.economist.com .

Learn another language.\nThat's the takeaway from recent brain research, which shows that bilingual people's brains function better and for longer after developing the disease.\nPsychologist Ellen Bialystok and her colleagues at York University in Toronto recently tested about 450 patients who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Half of these patients were bilingual, and half spoke only one language.\nWhile all the patients had similar levels of cognitive impairment, the researchers found that those who were bilingual had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's about four years later, on average, than those who spoke just one language. And the bilingual people reported their symptoms had begun about five years later than those who spoke only one language.\n\"What we've been able to show is that in these patients\u2026 all of whom have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and are all at [the] same level of impairment, the bilinguals on average are four to five years older \u2014 which means that they've been able to cope with the disease,\" Bialystok said.\nShe presented her findings today (Feb. 18) here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nSome results of this research were published in the Nov. 9, 2010 issue of the journal Neurology.\nCT brain scans of the Alzheimer's patients showed that, among patients who are functioning at the same level, those who are bilingual have more advanced brain deterioration than those who spoke just one language. But this difference wasn't apparent from the patients' behaviors, or their abilities to function. The bilingual people acted like monolingual patients whose disease was less advanced.\n\"Once the disease begins to compromise this region of the brain, bilinguals can continue to function,\" Bialystok said. \"Bilingualism is protecting older adults, even after Alzheimer's disease is beginning to affect cognitive function.\"\nThe researchers think this protection stems from brain differences between those speak one language and those who speak more than one. In particular, studies show bilingual people exercise a brain network called the executive control system more. The executive control system involves parts of the prefrontal cortex and other brain areas, and is the basis of our ability to think in complex ways, Bialystok said.\n\"It's the most important part of your mind,\" she said. \"It controls attention and everything we think of as uniquely human thought.\"\nBilingual people, the theory goes, constantly have to exercise this brain system to prevent their two languages from interfering with one another. Their brains must sort through multiple options for each word, switch back and forth between the two languages, and keep everything straight.\nAnd all this work seems to confer a cognitive benefit \u2014 an ability to cope when the going gets tough and the brain is besieged with a disease such as Alzheimer's.\n\"It's not that being bilingual prevents the disease,\" Bialystok told MyHealthNewsDaily. Instead, she explained, it allows those who develop Alzheimer's to deal with it better.\nMoreover, other research suggests that these benefits of bilingualism apply not only to those who are raised from birth speaking a second language, but also to people who take up a foreign tongue later in life.\n\"The evidence that we have is not only with very early bilinguals,\" said psychologist Teresa Bajo of the University of Granada in Spain, who was not involved in Bialystok's research. \"Even late bilinguals use these very same processes so they may have also the very same advantages.\"\n"}, {"score": 1235.697, "uuid": "08fbc257-b4ea-5be0-865f-835d9d908779", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-27-26463", "target_hostname": "autism.about.com", "target_uri": "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/11/03/is-autistic-communication-a-language-in-itself.htm", "page_rank": 1.1778083e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Is</em> Autistic Communication <em>a</em> <em>Language</em> in Itself?", "snippet": "I\u2019m not saying this <em>is</em> the sole form of communicating, but throwing him <em>a</em> few his way, like <em>learning</em> <em>at</em> least <em>a</em> few words in Italian, won\u2019t do harm and in fact seems to open more to focusing on what I am saying and how I am saying it to <em>better</em> understand my meaning.", "explanation": null, "document": "Is Autistic Communication a Language in Itself?\nFrom\u00a0Lisa Jo Rudy, About.com Guide November 3, 2010\nLast night, I received an interesting response to my blog about a \"Communication Shutdown\" run as a fundraiser for autism.\u00a0 Here's the response, from an adult with autism:\nI participated in the Shout-Out, being autistic... Even when I was unable to speak as a little kid, according to my parents (both likely autistic), I communicated clearly with my eyes and actions; as an adult, while my non-autistic ex couldn't 'read' my non-verbal communication, my autistic ex definitely could.\nThe shutdown reinforces the myth that just because non-auties don't natively understand us, we must not be communicating. It's like declaring that because I only know English, immigrants must all be yammering nonsense words. Imagine how silly someone would look to you if they did that!\nBoth auties and non-auties only natively communicate with our own kind, have to learn the other, and don't pick it up much easier as babies. Most autistic folk learn what we can for survival, some non-autie parents do, too. That's a lot better than deciding that the only \"real\" language is one's own, and promoting that idea as \"awareness\" of the people that only speak the other kinds...\nMy immediate response was confusion. My own son, who has high functioning autism (not Asperger's), has always had a tough time when placed in a group of kids with autism. Kids with autism are often louder, more perseverative, and more likely to tantrum than typical kids. As a result, a classroom filled with children on the spectrum is unlikely to be a relaxed, creative, or even predictable place. Even years after leaving that environment, Tom has been wary of groups of people on the autism spectrum - because he's concerned they'll \"bully\" him (his interpretation of perseverative name calling) or make very loud noises.\nBut after thinking about this overnight, I realize that the commenter isn't talking about hanging out in groups: he's talking about one-to-one communication. His suggestion is that the \"language of autism\" can be likened to \"Italian,\" in that it's a particular way of communicating that can be predicted, replicated, and understood on its own terms by native speakers. He even suggests that some non-autistics can learn the language well enough to be fluent.\nI have no idea whether there really is a \"language of autism\" that's shared by and understood by a large group of people. What's your take on this intriguing idea?\n"}, {"score": 1234.472, "uuid": "becc4da8-2f9b-58a7-aba2-f5dd177a2c55", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800tw-32-21575", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/second-language-toddlers_n_929248.html", "page_rank": 1.1814786e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "STUDY: <em>Learning</em> <em>A</em> Second <em>Language</em> Boosts Toddlers&#x27; Brain Function", "snippet": "Can <em>learning</em> <em>a</em> second <em>language</em> as <em>a</em> toddler give your child <em>a</em> cognitive edge over <em>kids</em> <em>who</em> wait until high school French class?", "explanation": null, "document": "STUDY: Learning A Second Language Boosts Toddlers' Brain Function\nFirst Posted: 08/18/11 09:27 AM ET Updated: 10/18/11 06:12 AM ET\nReact\nWeird\nFollow\nBy: FYI Living\nCan learning a second language as a toddler give your child a cognitive edge over kids who wait until high school French class?

This is the first study to demonstrate this advantage in children as young as two years of age. There is evidence that children can differentiate between different languages at a very early age; because of this ability, bilingual children learn to manage their attention between two languages, developing their executive functioning earlier than monolingual children.

There is evidence that children can differentiate between different languages at a very early age; because of this ability, bilingual children learn to manage their attention between two languages, developing their executive functioning earlier than monolingual children. This study holds encouraging news for parents who hope to raise their children in a multi-lingual household.\nFor More Information:\nJournal of Experimental Child Psychology, 2011\nBy Diane Poulin-Dubois; Agnes Blaye\nFrom the Centre for Research in Human Development, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada and UFR de Psychologie, Universit\u00e9 de Provence, Aix en Provence Cedex, France\n*FYI Living Lab Reports Are Summaries of the Original Research.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that the paper appeared in The Journal of Experimental Child Psychology in 2010; it appeared this year.\nFOLLOW HUFFPOST HEALTHY LIVING\n"}], [{"score": 1232.3014, "uuid": "72631071-4884-5126-8cfd-579cdd7daf4d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0503wb-26-00812", "target_hostname": "www.innerbonding.com", "target_uri": "http://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/1104/who-manages-your-money-your-loving-adult-or-your-wounded.html", "page_rank": 1.1852586e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Who</em> Manages Your Money - Your Loving <em>Adult</em> <em>or</em> Your Wounded", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> your fearful authoritarian wounded self, <em>or</em> your impulsive permissive wounded self, in charge of your money?

Can you relate? For many of us, the hope of close sibling relationships is one of our reasons for homeschooling. These words from Stefani remind us why. This post originally published on May 5, 2010.\nOne for all and all for one!\nThat was the solemn promise of the Three Musketeers.\nIt\u2019s the unofficial motto of Switzerland.\nIt is also one of the driving ideals behind many homeschooling families\u2019 decision to learn at home.\nHomeschooling is a promise that we, as a family, are in this thing together\u2013all of us championing each individual, and each individual giving his best for the family.\nEach day of living and working alongside each other in a home learning environment, our children are learning to empathize, to celebrate the achievements of others, to respectfully disagree, to encourage, sacrifice, and lead. Beyond academics\u2013they are also learning how to be parents, spouses, professionals and citizens.\nLet\u2019s face it though, when we are educating children of different ages, personalities, needs and goals, we often find ourselves running in six directions at once\u2013a far cry from the unity-building that we dreamed of.\nSo how can we honor the individuality of our children and at the same time foster family togetherness?\nIt helps to be intentional about creating an atmosphere of brotherhood. In the same way that we surround ourselves with good books that inspire a love of reading, we set out to create an environment that is rich in opportunities to grow loving relationships.\nHere are some of the ways that we make family unity a core subject in our homeschool.\nParty Down\nWe celebrate each other\u2019s accomplishments. When one of our boys has mastered his \u201ctimes 3\u201d facts, added a new specimen to his beetle collection, or learned all the letters in the alphabet, we are quick to honor the occasion with a special meal, a kitchen dance party, or a construction paper card.\nThe lesson: A brother\u2019s victory is a victory for us all.\nEdify\nWe catch each other when we fall. When a music performance doesn\u2019t go particularly well, an experiment goes awry or a \u201ccontraption\u201d doesn\u2019t work as intended, we help our boys to find real, concrete ways to help their brothers get back up and press on.\nThe lesson: A brother\u2019s defeat is a call for reinforcements.\nShow and Tell\nWe talk to each other about our goals and ideas, and we involve each other in our efforts. Even our littlest family member learned early on that a brother is a powerful ally in learning endeavors.\nWhen he began learning to read he would say, \u201cBrothers I\u2019m going to try to read now, come and watch me!\u201d The older boys listened with baited breath while he sounded out \u201cc-a-t\u2026. caaaaaaat.\u201d When he finally pronounced \u201ccat\u201d the room erupted with \u201cYou did it! That\u2019s great! Do another one!\u201d\nThe lesson: It is always easier to gather up the courage to tackle a difficult task when you know that your brothers are beside you.\nViva La Difference\nWhen our oldest boy has a karate belt test, we are all there to grip our seats and will him through it, even though none of us understands a word of korean or knows if he\u2019s doing his moves correctly.\nThe lesson: I care about what you care about because I care about YOU.\nPut Your Backs Into It\nWe work toward common goals. Plant a small garden together. Work together to put on a variety show for family or friends. Tape up a big piece of paper and, together, draw a new world. Put on gloves, grab some trash bags, and clean up a favorite hiking trail or park.\nThe lesson: We are strong as individuals, but we are unstoppable as a team.\nPractice Trickle Down Education\nOften, as a homeschooling mom, I feel like the full weight of my children\u2019s education rests squarely on my shoulders, when in truth I have strong young men to help me bear the load. Once a child learns a new task or idea, we encourage him to share it with his brothers.\nAn older boy can read to a younger one. He can teach his little brother to set the table, count by fives or play chopsticks on the piano, and in doing so he comes to understand that his knowledge holds real value not only for himself, but for his family.\nThe lesson: Each new bit of wisdom gained is a treasure to share.\nCherish\nMy older boys are having a blast reliving some of their greatest hits in homeschooling through my youngest. They love seeing their old easy reader books come out again. I often hear, \u201cOh I remember that one!

Playing while learning languages, is the easiest and less stressful way of becoming bilingual, we can all learn from children.\nChildren have a window of opportunity to learn a foreign language, any foreign language, just like they learn their native tongue.\nThe brain is simply hardwired for children to pick up any language naturally. Therefore, they can take any accent and imitate it.\nMore children are learning more than one language, and are starting to learn these new languages at a very early age.\nIn today\u2019s globalized world, many young children, whose parents insist that their child\u2019s education should include foreign languages, why?\nIn our increasing global society, the ability to speak a second language proficiently will open a door to new life opportunities\nAs one mother speaks out \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u2019s such a global environment now, you never know what you might need, I started schooling my daughter in foreign languages when she was 6 weeks old. I wanted to make sure she had every tool and every benefit at her disposal\u2019.\nNow her daughter is fluent in Japanese and Spanish. She also can understand bits of French, German, Arabic and Italian. Her daughter is only 5 years old.\nNot only is learning a foreign language easier for children than it is for adults, but children who are exposed to other languages also do better in school, score higher on standardized tests, are better problem solvers and are more open to diversity.\nWhen children start learning languages at birth, they have the capacity to learn many languages at once without getting confused \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because, as the brain develops, so too does the ability to separate one language from another.\nYoung children have time to learn through play-like language games.\nThey pick up language by taking part in language games, shared with an adult.\nThey firstly make sense of the activity and then get meaning from the adult\u2019s shared language.\nChildren have emotional advantage too.\nSince they\u2019re not as self-conscious as adults, they are not afraid of getting it wrong or saying words in a funny way.\nYoungsters are willing to call out their new foreign word, whether right or wrong and their spontaneity pays off with a faster fluency adoption.\nChildren need to feel that they are making progress. They need continual encouragement as well as praise for good performance, as any success motivates. You are in an ideal position to motivate and so help your child learn.\nYou and your child can enjoy learning a new language together, by using language games.\nThe process is so fun and natural you will forget that your acquiring a valuable new skill.\n"}, {"score": 1209.8674, "uuid": "be139e88-b176-5611-86c0-b3bef6eaebee", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100wb-74-14047", "target_hostname": "www.byki.com", "target_uri": "http://www.byki.com/customers.html", "page_rank": 1.33902684e-08, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Byki <em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> Software Testimonials", "snippet": "I&#x27;m still amazed and yes, you may use anything I&#x27;ve said <em>or</em> written, with my pleasure!

Last Monday, parents upset over the loss of these lessons went to the school board meeting to express their displeasure in losing the program as well as to argue for the many benefits of learning a second language at a young age.\nThe school board said it is constrained by the need to demonstrate acceptable Pennsylvania System of School Assessment test results under the No Child Left Behind Act.\nAccording to economics professor and Swarthmore-Wallingford school board member Mark Kuperberg, the school board understood the parents\u2019 concerns but simply cannot implement both science and language programs simultaneously. \u201cThe official reason is that we needed more time to teach science,\u201d Kuperberg said.\nSwarthmore College\u2019s education students involved in supplementary science, math and reading programs during and after school in nearby school districts are well aware of the tolls standardized testing can take on an elementary school\u2019s curriculum. In the past, standardized tests did not drill students on science, and, as a result, the science curriculum was often neglected. Due to the omission of science from the budget, Swarthmore students have begun a supplementary science program for Stetser Elementary this semester.\nKuperberg does not believe the instatement of a science program at the cost of the foreign language program was necessarily a poor decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable educational thing to do,\u201d he said. Kuperberg stated that science is generally lacking from elementary school curricula, and regardless of standardized test content, is a fundamental subject to teach to young students.\nKuperberg also questioned the effectiveness of the FLES program, pointing to the fact that language instruction only took place twice a week for about an hour, and that only Spanish was offered to students.\nStudents will still have an opportunity to learn a foreign language, but only during before- or after-school programs. These programs, however, are not free and may exclude students whose families cannot afford the additional instruction.\nAccording to Kuperberg, a number of Swatties have taught French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and German in these extra programs. \u201cWe are going to try to promote [that program] more,\u201d Kuperberg said.\nKuperberg also believes that the before- and after-school programs are more intensive and productive than the FLES program.\nLast year Tanya Nikiforova \u201907 taught Russian to a group of students at Swarthmore Rutledge Elementary School in a program run by Carrie Shankweiler, who serves as a liaison between the college and the elementary. The program in which Nikiforova was involved encompassed much more than language instruction.\n\u201cWe tried to integrate language into culture,\u201d Nikiforova said, citing the talent show and the food day that students organized in conjunction with language lessons. According to Nikiforova, most of the kids were extremely excited to be learning a new language and tried to incorporate what they learned into everyday conversations with one another.\nCritics of the decision argue that today, more than before, fluency in more than one language is a skill that can translate into additional professional opportunities, better cultural understanding, improved communication skills and perhaps a general enrichment of life. Early exposure to another language is the best approach to that goal.\n\u201cMy impression is that it is easier for children to learn a foreign language,\u201d Chinese Professor Xiaorong Li said. \u201cThey can integrate expressions by just observing.\u201d\nLinguistics professor Donna Jo Napoli drew a distinction between \u201clanguage acquisition\u201d and \u201clanguage learning,\u201d the former of which \u201coccurs naturally, without any instruction,\u201d Napoli said. Language learning, on the other hand, \u201cinvolves active teaching of a language,\u201d she said.\nLanguage instructon in elementary schools affects children at a critical phase in their cognitive development. According to Napoli, \u201cThe plasticity of the child\u2019s brain allows for rapid second language learning up to around the onset of puberty \u2013 where that plasticity begins to change. After that point, a child has no better luck at learning a second language than an adult does,\u201d she said.\nNapoli cited numerous advantages that multilingual students enjoy later in life. \u201cA person who speaks multiple languages has advantages traveling, and in enjoying literature and songs in other languages. That person also has job opportunities that are not available to the monolingual person,\u201d she said.\nDiscussion\n"}, {"score": 1195.651, "uuid": "88221d31-06cf-54e7-842f-d8b41a7fb7b6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0708wb-74-21742", "target_hostname": "www.yourlanguageguide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yourlanguageguide.com/learning-spanish-language.html", "page_rank": 1.2406643e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Learning</em> Spanish <em>Language</em>: Meals with Mom", "snippet": "If you&#x27;re <em>a</em> mom <em>or</em> if you know <em>a</em> mom <em>who</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> <em>language</em> learner <em>or</em> <em>who</em> would like to be <em>a</em> <em>language</em> learner, please enjoy this post, share it with others and visit the other participating bloggers via the links <em>at</em> the bottom of this post.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learning Spanish Language:\nMeals with Mom\nI am learning Spanish language.

Ha, ha, when I put it that way, it sounds like Moses and the Israelites. Some days it feels like I\u2019ve been wandering forty years in a foreign language learning desert. That makes it sound like my approach has not been accelerated language learning. Actually, it goes in fits and spurts.\nAs a small child, we were the only Anglo family living in a Hispanic neighborhood. Everybody around me spoke Spanish. In middle school, I took Spanish. In high school, a Spanish speaking exchange student lived with us. When we weren\u2019t fighting about the volume of the TV, I conversed with her in Spanish.\nProgress has been up and down over the years. As an adult, I\u2019ve tried multiple language learning strategies . I\u2019ve read Spanish books. They help increase my vocabulary and build my understanding of grammar.\nIn the community, at the park, and around town, I gravitate toward Spanish speakers. Maybe I\u2019m a show-off. I speak to them in Spanish. It feels good to practice. But I have the same conversation every time:\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m learning Spanish.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you speak very well, where did you learn?\u201d\n\u201cI had some Mexican neighbors. I was trying to teach them English, but I ended up learning Spanish language more than they did English language.\u201d\nWe laugh. We commiserate about how hard it is to learn English--I wonder if it truly is harder than learning Spanish language. I ask, yet again, how to say \u201cswings\u201d or \u201cslide\u201d or any nearby object. Eventually, we drift on to other activities.\nLast week, the neighbors\u2019 car wouldn\u2019t start. I taxied them to the bank, the junk yard, the school. We chatted in Spanish. I learned a few new words, remembered several that I\u2019d forgotten, and received a couple of grammatical corrections. Afterwards, she brought me a book: a big tome of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. Boring! I promised to read it in the evenings after the children are asleep. Yeah, right. I\u2019ll use it if I need a sleeping pill.\nI want my children to learn a second language . When my now five-year-old was first learning to talk, I taught him dozens of Spanish words. He picked them up quickly. I was pleased that it was so easy for him. Eventually, he sorted out the difference between Spanish and English. Then he said, \u201cTalk to me in English, mom.\u201d Gulp.\nWith child number two, I\u2019m trying again. I think that the mistake I made with child number one was I only taught him isolated words. I didn\u2019t converse with him. My perfectionist nature told me that my Spanish wasn\u2019t good enough to talk to him all day long. Perhaps I gave up too easily.\nI started Spanish emersion lunches with my two year old. Every day, when we sit down at our kitchen table for lunch, I talk to him in Spanish. I hope to give him the gift of learning Spanish language. I want him to have a lifelong skill. After only a few days of thesse meals with mom, my little one had a surprisingly good understanding. When I\u2019d ask him a question in Spanish, he\u2019d respond appropriately in English. After a few days, he started repeating a few of the new Spanish words.\nHe\u2019s still in that window of first language acquisition. His mind is sticky. New words stick in his brain like sand on drying glue. But the glue is just about dry. Last week, I prattled at him in Spanish while we waited for the neighbor in the junk yard. He said, \u201cTalk like dis.\u201d He scrunched up his face, used his fingers to contort his lips as if to wipe away learning Spanish language. He said, \u201cNo in Spanish. Talk like dis.\u201d What? Is it is already too late? Has the language learning window already closed?\nThe purpose of this post is to illustrate several language learning strategies. I\u2019ve been working on learning Spanish language most of my life. I\u2019ve made slow but continuing progress along the way. I continue to try to improve my speaking and listening skills. The path to mastery is not always easy. I tire along the way, but after a short rest, I get back to work.\nYesterday, my older son asked to listen to church services in Spanish. Services are given in English, and simultaneously translated into Spanish. Spanish speakers can listen to headphones to hear the translation. My boys and I donned headphones for the service. The older one kept them on for about two thirds of the service. Success. There is still an opening in that language learning window. I\u2019ll continue with my efforts to learn Spanish language and to teach it to my two boys.\nForeign Language Learning Tips\nHere are my top foreign language learning tips:\nBuild a dialog: create a simple dialog, \u201cHi. I\u2019m learning Spanish language. Can you help me out? I need to practice.\u201d \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Include one or two ways to expand your vocabulary: \u201cCan you tell me the name of this object?\u201d\nTalk: to as many people as you can. When you meet some who speaks your target language: talk. Learn a simple dialog that you can try out with any new person that you meet.\nRead: check out children\u2019s books from the library. The short sentences and easy vocabulary will give you basic skills. As your skills improve, look for increasingly harder books.\nTeach your children: speak to them in your target language. Even if your skills aren\u2019t perfect. You can open the door to a new language. They can build on your imperfect knowledge as they grow.\nSet aside time: learning a new language takes time. Target specific times to practice. I set aside a certain time of day for language learning: meals with my little one. I also practice learning Spanish language by attending my church\u2019s Spanish Sunday school class.\nPersist: return again and again to your language learning strategies. (Even if it takes you forty years. Grin.) Talk. Read. Talk.\nCelebrate: your successes. As you improve, take time to notice how much you\u2019ve learned. Give yourself a pat on the back, a note in your journal, or enjoy a bowl of ice cream.\nRead More\n"}, {"score": 1194.7278, "uuid": "8b620339-3e03-51a8-8700-78cfb7ee32d6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id":

Smith\nComputer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) for Teaching English to Young Learners (TEYL). The computer is a child's wonderland. The use of CALL software such as Windows Messenger, E-mail, the Internet, and other specific and non specific software can be integrated using effective pedagogy to create a powerful language learning programme. Computer Technology offers a certain degree of independent and structured learning. It easily assists and even stimulates young second language learners in all four skills of listening, speaking, writing, reading and also critical thinking (Cobb & Stevens, 1996). Two case studies presented show that computer technology has enhanced programmes in literacy and language learning.\nTechnology Enhanced Language Learning (TELL). Hanson-Smith (2004) suggests that computer technology can provide the student with the means to control his or her own learning, to construct meaning and to evaluate and monitor their own performance. Bruce (1993) states that the computer will change the nature of learning by placing the power of learning more in the hands of the learner. However, focus will need to be adjusted in developing an effective pedagogy for using computers in the classroom. Students will need to adapt to the technology. A student's personality, language proficiency and experience could influence the progress in adapting to TELL. Risk-takers are likely to master software easily and students who possess a higher language competence are likely to benefit from electronic medium. The more skilled and experienced users will focus on content whereas the less skilled may focus on mechanics. (Phinney, 1996). So it is important for teachers to identify, states Bickel & Truscello (1996) which strategies they should use. Structure is essential to making the computer lab an effective teaching environment (Trickel & Liljegren, 1998).\nCobb & Stevens (1996) make several recommendations in designing a computer based language programme. Designers should pay attention to pedagogy used in the process. Software should entail repetitive language drills and practices that provide immediate feedback and allow students to proceed at their own pace. It could be used to teach grammar creating an environment in which students could use the target language naturally on the screen. Computer use would stimulate student discussion, writing, critical thinking in a role that would empower the learner to use and understand language in using, for example, a word processing, spelling and grammar checkers; MS Messenger and the use of the Internet as a multimedia tool. This allows a variety of media including text, graphics, sound, animation and video which relates to a more authentic learning environment. (Underwood, 1984). Students can be paired up across the Internet or even in class and hold authentic realistic conversations. The hypertext medium of the World-Wide Web or Internet enhances reading and writing skills (Warschaver, 1995) and suits students with different levels of language ability. Students can compile messages using e-mail (Warschaver, 1996) to negotiate different languages experiences, collaborate on projects, ask the teach for help, indulge in real-time conversations, send letters, have pen-pals and go to libraries, all using the computer and the Internet (Hoffman, 1996). In tests outcomes, it shows that students wrote more effectively while having positive attitudes toward learning (Chapell, Jamerison & Park, 1996).\nUsing e-mail, students can receive effective feedback. The teacher can comment on writings using this facility. The teacher is able to respond to requests from students and examine their work in progress. E-mail feedback makes it possible for a teacher to develop ideas, both collectively and individually and ask better questions and at the same time providing examples and offering remarks.\nHypermedia (a retrieval system that provide access to texts, audio, graphics and video related to a particular subject), according to Ashworth (1996), provides a rich collection of resources. This can be used to support reading and listening in a foreign language and facilitate pronunciation training. Reading over the Web is a receptive skill that requires no oral skills to complete. Proof that the student has understood a reading can be accomplished through writing. The linking of media supports reading which by way of digitized voice can be pronounced. Contextual meaning can be illustrated through pop up graphics, animated sequences and video clips.\nEven though not strictly an ESOL class, we see how computers enhance the learning process with a group of 15 year old students in the following case study.\nCase Study # 1. This case study is based on an ethnographic research tradition using grounded theory to derive theory from classroom processes. It looks at the teaching methodology and classroom environment by way of specific observations of a literacy, language and numeracy class of fifteen year old first and second language speakers.\nA Computer Learning Assistance Programme (CALP) was implemented in 2000 to deal with a group of school leavers who had no interest in normal school study. Computers were an important aspect in CALP, used to enhance literacy, learning, language and numeracy. New Zealand Qualification Authority units standards were used to provide the basis of a National Certificate in Employment Skills (NCES). The computers were used for word processing, specialized software for learning numeracy, English and research of topics.\nThe 17 students came with an array of problems: attitudes such as lack of self-confidence, rebellion, drugs, homeless, alcohol, depression and lack of English. The students indicated the main reason for leaving school was the fact they couldn't learn in a normal school environment.\nDuring the 24 week full time course, there were six observations. The scope of the findings surrounded different modes of delivery and methodology. These included a teacher-central classroom and one-on-one self paced study plus group work. During the observations, learning was observed to take place only when students worked individually on their computers with the self paced units. Students did not respond well to typical teacher delivered classroom instructions. It was also observed that students always kept themselves busy using the computer and only requested help when they needed it. Hanson-Smith (2004) mentions this by saying that computers are patient, they speak clearly, and they don't (in their best incarnations) give off subtexts implying that the user is dumb; however, the current success of multimedia software may be that the student is kept busy and feels safe. The results revealed that, with the exception of five students who dropped out of the programme, twelve completed the course and received their NCES.\nBrown (2000) said that there are visual and auditory styles of learning along with process, storage and retrieval. This has to do with how students productively express meaning. Brown also says that learning can be thought of as cognitive, affective and physiological traits. These are the basic processes used in learning. They are relatively stable indicators of how learners perceive, interact with and respond to their learning environment.\nIn regards to styles of learning, a field independent style enables a student to distinguish parts from a whole whereas field dependence is dependent on the total field so that the parts are not easily perceived. The students under study were generally field dependent in that they couldn't perceive the need for group work or teacher centred classroom instruction.\nCase Study # 2. This study was also done by way of an ethnographic research tradition using grounded theory in 2004. Different from Case Study # 1 it centred around one student who was field independent studying a National Certificate in Education Achievement course from the New Zealand Correspondence School in Mandarin Chinese. The course consists of 12 lessons with one set of language files for each lesson. Each lesson included two or more sets of text with drills and grammar points. The course also included a list of vocabulary words in both pinyin and characters with English meanings covered by the 12 lessons. The course was enhanced through the use of MS Word\u00ae & MS Windows XP\u00ae Chinese Language Feature. The student created his own dictionary using an MS Word\u00ae Table with seven columns, the first with pinyin, then the Chinese characters, the English meanings, the word used in a sentence in Chinese characters, a reference number to the lesson and a grammar point for the word in the way it was used in the sentence. Vocabulary was added at the start of each lesson. He then created a set of macros to sort the table on any of the columns. This provided a way of showing information in different ways. This 'dictionary table' was left at the start of the document. The document was then divided up into 12 sections each covering information and notes typed from each of the lessons. Text was typed out both in pinyin and Chinese characters. It was found that after typing the sentence out in Chinese characters several times, a person easily remembered what each character stood for. Each Chinese character text was linked to language voice file. By clicking on the icon, the student heard the voice file of the text using MS Windows Media Player\u00ae. The file could be changed in any way from repeating a sentence to repeating a word. A search from anywhere in the dictionary table using either the Chinese pinyin column, the Chinese character column, or English meaning column immediately to the information needed. The use of the computer and computer software in this fashion created an interactive language programme that enhanced learning.\nCALL Software. Squire & McDougall (1994) point out that teachers should be responsible for the selection of suitable educational software packages plus devise various kinds of relevant activities based on the content of the software. Teachers can modify a software package to support a variety of activities in the classroom to help fulfill their teaching goals. Software of this nature can be divided up into content free (software that is not necessarily designed for ESOL) and subject specific. Content free can include word processors, spreadsheets and databases. Content free software includes much of the afore mentioned use of the computer technology and the Internet for language learning whereas subject specific packages are designed to be used in specific teaching and controlled learning environments. This type of software can be further divided up into instructional, revelatory and conjectural. Some of this software is specifically designed to support an existing curriculum. This is known as explicit software, developed and used for an educational purpose.\nTwo packages examined here, by no means is exhaustive of what is available today but is at the very least only representative. 'Learn to Speak English' (Romusier, Bruno & Rice, 1995) and 'English Works 1 & 2' (O'neill, 1993) uses programmed instruction, second language acquisition and, to a degree, an artificial intelligence in their makeup.\n'Learn to Speak English' (Romusier, Bruno & Rice, 1995) comes with two CD disks, plus tests and workbook. The software is topic-based using situations with people and places which shows the influence of CALL's historical development. The guide encourages students to take a linear approach to all work. The package is for elementary to lower intermediate students. With 'English Works 1 & 2' (O'neill, 1993), the first CD contains 16 topic based units. It's a little more advanced both in presentation and operation than 'English With Us'. After each dialogue language is developed further with grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation points are dealt with.\nFor a more comprehensive list of software tailored for TEYL see Appendix I.\nConclusion\nLanguage Learning can be integrated with computer technology, the World Wide Web, and the use of general and specific language software. It can enhance language programmes already in use. Computer Assisted Language Learning includes many different aspects from communicating by e-mail, speaking using messenger software or researching a project in English over the Internet. Language specific software is available for more controlled exercises and language learning.\n1.

In Latin America, children start <em>learning</em> English <em>at</em> the age of 4.", "explanation": null, "document": "Share\nA lot of countries start teaching foreign languages from a very early age. In Latin America, children start learning English at the age of 4. With the proximity of the US and the hope (for some at least) to build a career there, it makes sense to start early. The results are quite impressive, as children are able to absorb more language-related information when they are very young. Indeed, they do not yet have this crippling fear of looking stupid in front of their friends while speaking a foreign tongue in class, and the number of English native speakers in Latin America makes the teaching process itself much more interesting: children grasp accents much better than adults, and that way the accent they get used to working with is of the purest form.\nThen you might think: well, there are native English speakers everywhere, right? Right! So most countries must have a lot of native English teachers handy, right? Well, no. Take France for example: beautiful country, great food, and thanks to the Eurotunnel, lots of native English speakers around. Unfortunately, the school system is not a very attractive profession. Years and years of study necessary to teach from outdated and boring schoolbooks to pupils who only start studying foreign languages at the age of 11. Quite late to start, isn\u2019t it? Remember when you were 11? How important it was to be friends with the right people, to say the right things at the right time, and most importantly to express a practiced disdain for everything academic? Needless to say, the prospect of learning a new language is not the most exciting to pupils of this age.\nFortunately, things get better once you start going to uni, right? Ah, wrong again! In France, if you want to be good at languages, it\u2019s very simple, you need to actually study languages. If you study anything else, forget it, you are bound to have the languages in your course considered either optional, or not counting for much in your final grade. And let\u2019s face it, students work for the grades.\nBut if you specialise in languages at uni, then the fun (yes, I did say fun) starts. If you study English , you\u2019ll learn English phonetics. Oh yes, did I forget to mention that before uni you don\u2019t actually study phonetics? So basically if you see a new word and you don\u2019t know how to pronounce it, forget the dictionary, you need to ask your teacher. With what we\u2019ve already established about kids\u2019 willingness to appear eager to learn in class, this can definitely account for the amazing accent French people tend to have when they speak English.\nG.

All instructors are native speakers or speak with native-level proficiency. They are carefully selected for communicative skills, talent, and enthusiasm to share their language.\nOur Program and Approach\nAdults generally learn language better when they can use their understanding of their native language and logic and reasoning capabilities to greatly aid the process of leaning an additional language. Most adults are practical learners, learning based on usability and objectives rather than based on theories or purely academic pursuits. They tend to show the most progress when presented with a practical combination of reading, writing, listening and speaking, a practical mix of English and the language being learned and a focus on useful aspects of the language that they can use from the very start.\nAdditionally, language learning is much more effective in small groups.\u00a0 It is extremely important when learning a language that the student speak and receive appropriate guidance. For this reason, it's not practical for one language instructor to effectively help a class of thirty students.\nUsing our approach, adults learn language quickly through interaction in small-group classes.\nLearning a Foreign Language - It's Not Easy, or Is It?\nWhether \"learning\" a foreign language is easy or not depends on your objectives. Ordering food in a restaurant and handling basic introductions can be learned without too much difficulty. Achieving true fluency requires substantially more time.\nThe idea of a person who learns a foreign language fluently in almost no time with no effort is largely a myth. It generally takes time and practice, but the process can be a fun and rewarding experience.\nLearning a Language can be Fun\nWe offer the opportunity to learn 36 different languages at our Language Door School in San Diego. Our comfortable, casual environment helps to make learning the language of your choice fun and convenient. We schedule our classes at times that work for busy adults. Enrich your life as you learn one language or learn many.\nSchools of Thought\nThere are many schools of thought on how best to learn a foreign language. Many of these schools claim they have found the \"best\" way to learn. We feel that the best way to learn depends on the person. Some people learn better orally, some visually. Some learn best when they want to, others when they have to. Some prefer rules and structure, others practice and application. Nobody can tell you what works best, but teachers, books, and experience can help show you the way.\nFurthermore, we also believe that a foreign language can best be learned through a combination of instruction, study, and practice. Any one of these in isolation, while still be helpful, will generally be less effective and rewarding.\nFor instance, consider the benefit of having a lesson each week and doing nothing else, compared to having the same lesson each week but learning the vocabulary beforehand, or reinforcing what you learned after the lesson through actual use in conversation.\nVocabulary\nSome people benefit from learning vocabulary lists, while for others the effort exceeds the rewards. Regardless, vocabulary forms the building blocks of language. Whether by studying lists or learning though usage, you'll want to develop some vocabulary.\nThe amount of words in a language can be staggering (from twenty thousand to more than one hundred thousand depending on the language and how the words are counted). However, one hundred words can be sufficient for basic conversation, and a couple thousand for fairly normal conversation.\nIf you want to improve your vocabulary retention, consider trying word associations. The association can be either logical or illogical, whichever works best for you.\nFor instance, the Spanish word el coche can logically be associated with coach (like a carriage) which was the predecessor to the car. It may help to imagine your car as a coach, or imagine horses pulling it. The illogical approach might say el coche sounds like coach (such as a basketball coach), and try to link coach and car in the most vivid way possible. For instance, imagine your basketball coach lifting your car above his or her head, then throwing it at a basketball hoop or through a wall. You can remember that el coche is masculine in Spanish by adding to the image - in the first example, imagine male horses pulling your car, or in the second example, use a male coach.\nThe time it takes to create these associations can pay dividends later on through easier retention. As you practice, you'll get quicker and create better associations.\nGrammar\nPeople often point out that kids learn language easily, and kids don't study grammar. Kids do learn easily in some respects (i.e., accent), but consider the amount of time they spend playing with friends, watching cartoons, or with other activities in that language. Many experts feel adults prefer to think logically, and learn better based on structure and rules such as grammar.\nComprehension\nComprehension improves with practice, whether through lessons, reading, or conversation.\nThe recent growth of DVD's provides a great tool to improve comprehension. The language options vary by movie, but many have audio and/or subtitle options in major languages. For instance if learning French, try watching a movie first in French audio with English subtitles, then French audio with French subtitles, then French audio with no subtitles. For better results, watch the movie with a dictionary nearby, and when you hear or see a word you still don't understand, look it up! The audio track and subtitles do not always match, but they are usually close enough to provide a very effective learning tool.\nSummary\nWe feel there's no \"secret\" to learning a foreign language. We recommend you learn based on what works best for you. Discuss different methods and tools with us or with your teacher. If possible, use a combination of instruction, study, and practice.

Education Department folks say they don't expect substantive changes, however.\nThe U.S. Department of Education today released a guidebook to help states set new proficiency standards and academic achievement targets for English-language learners.\nThe report, commissioned by the education department and written by ELL experts at the American Institutes of Research, the Wisconsin Center for Educational Research, and WestEd, describes empirical methods state policymakers may use to determine exactly what English proficiency means for students, how long it should take students to reach it, and how to factor in those proficiency levels when measuring progress in the academic content areas.\nThe guidebook, called \"National Evaluation of Title III Implementation Supplemental Report: Exploring Approaches To Setting English-Language Proficiency Performance Criteria and Monitoring English-Learner Progress,\" is directed at assessment and accountability officials in state departments of education, as well as senior state education agency officials, those who provide technical assistance and people who advise education governing boards.\nThe release of the guide comes at a key time for states, many of which are in the process of seeking to escape provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Act by applying for flexibility waivers. In those applications, states must address how they will hold schools accountable for the language and academic proficiency of English learners. It also comes at a time when states are beginning to adopt the Common-Core academic standards and must grapple with how to adapt those so that English learners may fully access them.\nIt is the first of four reports to be released as part of a four-year study undertaken by AIR to evaluate Part A of Title III , the provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that provides federal grants to states and local school districts to education English-language learners.\nRobert Linquanti, a senior research associate at WestEd and one of the guidebook's authors, said the new publication is meant to \"start the discussion\" with state policymakers on three key questions:\n1. How to determine what the \"finish line\" is for English-language proficiency;\n2. How long should it take students to reach that definition of proficiency once you account for where they started and how long they've been receiving services; and\n3. How to account for English-proficiency levels when setting expectations for students' academic progress\nTo answer the first question, the guidebook outlines three analytical methods policymakers can follow. On the second question, the researchers describe two ways states may use to figure out the time frame for an English learner to reach a certain proficiency standard. And on the third question, the guidebook describes three approaches states may use to account for students' proficiency levels when setting goals for their academic progress.\nAll of the approaches rely on using information mined from the longitudinal data systems states have been building to monitor student achievement.\nLinquanti and co-author H. Gary Cook, who is the research director for the World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment consortium, a group that is developing a new assessment of English proficiency to be aligned with the common core, advise that states use a combination of some or all of the methods they describe. They also stress that this guidebook\u2014 summarized here \u2014is not meant to be the final word on how states set proficiency standards and achievement targets for English learners.\n\"We see this as the beginning of the discussion,\" Linquanti said. \"We don't think we have all the answers.

I found that students were more apt to participate in an activity if it incorporated playfulness and physical movement. The resulting intrinsic motivation seemed to stimulate students' affectively and give them the desire to learn. There was, however, skepticism among a few teachers when using play such as music, games, and TPR in the classroom. I occasionally experienced minor criticisms and heard comments such as, \"How can students learn when they are having fun?\" or \"Students should sit in their seats and pay attention when learning.\" Although I have found that such playful activities to stimulate students and promote learning, I know there are others who feel such activities do not compliment language acquisition. In this review I hope to examine research from the professional community on the effectiveness of playfulness and affect in language learning.\nAccording to Cook (2000), trends in cognitive linguistics tend to concentrate on what is going on in the child's mind, following Chomsky; mainly focusing on the existence of some internal program. Studies in this area are based on the assumption that acquisition only involves the independent development of grammatical and phonological competence in isolation, rather than interaction with a child's physical, social, and personal development. As a result, little attention has been paid to the role of the environment on a child's language acquisition. Research has done little to answer the following question: What does happen in a child's mind when they listen to a song in another language, move to the rhythm of a foreign rhyme, or engage in a game that requires them to speak a foreign tongue?\nIntrinsic motivation\nMusic, games, and TPR activities constitute an activity-based approach to language learning. General comments on the psychological effects of an activity-based approach on children were made by Vale and Feunteun (1995). They state that an activity-based approach has the potential to lower social and emotional constraints and pressures that interfere with effective learning. To answer how an activity-based approach lowers such learning barriers, it might be best to begin by discussing motivation. Deci and Ryan (1985) explain that when the educational environment provides challenges and rich sources of stimulation which include, in my view music, games, TPR, etc., it sparks intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation raises students' natural curiosity and interest which promotes learning. A study conducted by Dornyei (1990) also reveals that intrinsic motivation may promote long-term retention of language. In fact, a number of researchers believe that those who learn intrinsically gain superior understanding of the material being learned (Crookes and Schmidt, 1991; Deci, 1995). An activity-based approach to language learning seems to not only promote intrinsic motivation, but the resulting intrinsic motivation appears to promote a better understanding of the language in the long run.\nPrior to the 1990's, much of the research examining the specific role of music, games, and TPR activities in language learning was limited only to the affective outcomes of such activities. There was still a problem between how motivation influenced language acquisition. For example, Coleman (1967) claimed that games encompass a wide range of skills and enable students to see the consequences of their own actions. Allowing one to see the effects of their own actions promotes intrinsic motivation, but how intrinsic motivation benefits language learning was still not clear. A claim by Rosenbach (1988) when discussing the benefits of using music in the classroom, simply acknowledges that using music in the classroom promotes intrinsic motivation, but how intrinsic motivation leads to language acquisition is not examined. Some such as Santos (1988) suggest that songs help students develop linguistic competences in pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary and comprehension. But again, there is little literature tying together how intrinsic motivation leads to such linguistic competences.\nEmotion\nTo gain a better understanding of how intrinsic motivation promotes learning, I will examine the physiological processes generated by emotion. In a paper discussing emotion, Ratner (2000) refers to Vygotsky's view that emotions are integrated into cognition and are formed by cultural processes. For example, the social activity of music in the classroom, which promotes intrinsic motivation, can also foster various positive emotional responses. It is difficult to determine whether positive emotion promotes intrinsic motivation or if intrinsic motivation sparks positive emotion. It might be safe to say that positive emotion and intrinsic motivation are mutually reinforcing.\nExtensive research on the physiological relationship between emotion and cognition has been conducted by Damasio (1994). According to Damasio, the brain releases \"chemical messages\" which have a major impact on the efficiency of the cognitive process. This concept is applied to second language acquisition by Schumann (1990). Schumann explains that a gland in the brain, called the amygdala, evaluates emotional stimuli and relays \"chemical messages\" to other emotion centers of the brain. Once these emotion centers are activated, they may influence what is perceived and learned by an individual, contributing to second language learning. Thus positive emotion, by triggering a chemical response in the amygdala, creates a pathway for language acquisition.\nLiterature in the 1990's began describing how specific activities contribute to neural stimulation and learning. Arnold (1999) suggests that movement such as dancing or TPR, activates one's mental capacities and stimulates their neural network. Relaying this to Vygotsky and Schumann, we might say that social activity of movement fosters positive emotion which triggers the amygdala and provides support for learning. A connection was also made between music and positive emotion by Hansen (1999). Hansen explains that rhythm and harmony from song activates different areas of the auditory, visual, and motor cortex. He declares that this activation results in the release of endorphins (possibly Damasio's \"chemical messages\") which enhance pleasure, free emotional blocks, stimulate mental activity, and lead to acquisition.\nAn additional study conducted by Medina (1993), looks at the effectiveness of music on vocabulary acquisition. She does not discuss the role of emotion or physiological process described by Schumann, however, she does conclude that music affects second language acquisition indirectly by providing a\"pathway\" for language acquisition. Cook (2000) confirms that Medina's results are consistent with other statements made regarding the efficacy of music, and also rhythm, in language acquisition. Tying Medina's study to Schumann's physiological process, it might be safe to say that her \"pathway\" consists of the amygdala and the release of endorphins. This \"pathway\" bridges the gap between intrinsic motivation and language acquisition.\nPlay\nSo far, I have examined literature with a focus on music, games, and TPR on language acquisition. I want to shift focus away from these specifics at this point and look into all activities under the umbrella of play. In addition, I am making a generalization that the discussions on intrinsic motivation and emotion above pertain to all forms of play. There is extensive amount of literature on the topic of play (Vygotsky, 1933; Huizinga, 1955; Bateson, 1972; Cook, 2000; Lantolf, 2001). As Huizinga (1955) notes, all people play and all people have the ability to play. It is, however, difficult to define what play is. Play varies among activities, social contexts, and age groups. Play might involve a game, but not always. Play can involve imagination, but it may also base itself on reality. Bateson (1972) makes a concrete attempt to clear the water on the definition play. He explains that when two individuals are playing, there is an intuitive sense that the current activity being engaged in is \"play.\" \"Play\" looks something like, \"the actions which are now being engaged in do not denote what these actions, for which they stand, would traditionally denote.\" For example, two children involved in playing \"house\" are playing because the activities carried out in playing house (pretending to cook dinner, etc.) do not stand for what \"house\" denotes in an adult society.\nPlay has many forms under its umbrella, including fantasy, story telling, music, movement, games, etc. Play almost always promotes excitement, enjoyment, and a relaxing atmosphere. The first research, and probably some of the most influential research on play was conducted by Vygotsky in the first half of the 1900s. Vygotsky (1933) said that play creates a zone of proximal development (ZDP) in children. According to Vygotsky, the ZDP is the distance between one's actual developmental level and one's potential developmental level when interacting with someone and/or something in the social environment (Vygotsky, 1978). During play, children are always above their average age, above their daily behavior, and ahead of their actual development level. It is as if children are trying to jump ahead of themselves when playing in order to explore their learning potential. Work by a number of researchers compliment Vygotsky's theory of play and the ZPD (Sylva, et al, 1974; Lantolf, 2001). As Lantolf (2001) explains, when children pretend to be a mother, father, a doctor, a famous person, etc. (when Vygotsky says they create a ZPD) they engage in activities that are not just about enjoyment, but allow them to project into the future. Contributions of play toward effective learning, thought organization, and problem solving were also found by Sylva, et al (1974). Results from their study show that children use information from mistakes during play to construct internal models that assist them in solving future problems. If play does indeed create a ZPD, it seems to promote development because children are able to project themselves into the future and learn by developing future problem solving strategies.\nPlay is also highly influential in language learning. In addition to songs, games, and TPR activities, verbal play can be used. According to Cook (2000), play in language learning is composed of two opposite spectrums: patterned sound at one end and pragmatic contextualized meaning at the other. The patterned end contains verse, speech, and semantic meaning. The pragmatic end resembles the interaction which takes place between interlocutors (touch, eye contact, affection, emotion, etc.) Butzkamm (1980) argues that verbal play also provides children with the training phases necessary for developing new verbal skills. Types of language play vary widely, from vocabulary games to talking one's self. Language play incorporates word play, unregulated rules, and enjoyment. Language play at the elementary school level might include a task to create \"crazy\" sentences such as, The octopus ate the giant purple banana.\nThroughout this discussion, I have concentrated on play and affect in learning among children. However, play and affect are present among adults just as much as they are among children, with a few notable differences. Cook (2000) distinguishes play among adults and children in a discussion about fantasy. He notes that children are more likely to take part in make-believe and adults in fantasy. The difference being that both adults and children fantasize, yet children tend to act out their fantasies crossing the boundary into make-believe. Butzkamm (1980) confirms that play is also present among older learners during language play. In language play, older learners tend to use more mature language than children and pull ideas from the surrounding environment or personal relations. In a study carried out by Sullivan in a Vietnamese high school language classroom (2001), play is quite prevalent during communicative language learning activities. In the study, students are working on a playful narrative. Language is more complex than that used by younger foreign language students, yet laughing and excitement are still an integral part of the lesson.\nAuthenticity\nWhile play and affect may fulfill their own set of goals in learning, at some point it seems necessary for the learning such activities provide to be applied to the 'real' world. Cook believes that reality and the artificial world are complementary and that each reinforces our understanding of the other. Yet Sullivan (2001) raises the questions, \"Whose reality is 'real'?\" \"What context is 'authentic'?\" Reality and authenticity is discussed extensively by van Lier (1996). He agrees with Sullivan that the definition of 'real' becomes a bit murky and suggests 'authenticity' might be a better term. According to van Lier, authenticity does not necessarily have to do with material from the 'real' world, but a learner's self determination and commitment to understanding. Authenticity is a 'process of personal engagement.' Thus playful activities involving imagination may not be considered 'real,' but are still authentic if learners are engaged in the activity. Cook (2000) also notes that given the controversy with the term 'real,' one might be better off using 'authentic.' Activities may not be 'real' yet they can still be 'authentic' and quite useful.\nThere is still much work to be done in the area of play and affect in learning. Until the 1990's the gap between affect (motivation and emotion) and language acquisition still remained. As with Medina's (1993) study on the effectiveness of music on vocabulary acquisition, literature acknowledged that intrinsic motivation and emotion resulting from play created a pathway for language acquisition, but the exact properties of that 'pathway' were never clearly defined. Schumann's (1990) discussion of the amygdala opens the 'pathway' and shows how research in intrinsic motivation (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Crookes and Schmidt, 1991; Deci, 1995), emotion (Vygotsky; Damasio, 1994), and play (Vygotsky, 1933; Huizinga, 1955; Bateson, 1972; Cook, 2000; Lantolf, 2001) compliment each other in the field of language learning. Schumann contributes significantly to the idea that an activity-based approach to language teaching involving play and affect has positive influence on language acquisition among all age groups.\nREFERENCES\nArnold, J.

The names of the person who brought up the issue and the other participants as well as some of the details have been changed in consideration of everyone's privacy.\nI have edited the flow of the spoken words to improve readability. Here and there, I have added some explanations of the work and its tools that the participants had at other points in the workshop. Aside from these edits, this article is almost verbatim from the actual session.\nBecause of the length of this article, it is primarily aimed at teachers, apprentice-teachers and those with some experience of the LearningMethods work, though others may find it interesting to pore through the whole piece. There will be a shorter version coming soon that just covers the main points of the problem, the tools used to explore it and its solution.\nThe session:\nRaphael: The problem I want to bring up revolves around being less skilled than I would like to be in something that is integral to my profession and I feel a great deal of shame and judgement about it. So this shame has tended in the past to prevent me from doing anything about it.\nI am a rabbi and I am not literate in Hebrew and one is expected to be able to access texts in Hebrew and Aramaic in its many variations. I didn\u2019t have much of a religious background in my family as I grew up. I managed to get through rabbinical school but, unlike most of the people there, I had not had the kind of education as a child that would lead to the level of work that is required of you in a rabbinical school, so I was behind from the onset. I did manage to do enough to complete the course work. But enough to complete the course work and feeling competent are two different things and also at this point I wouldn\u2019t even be qualified to start\u2026\nDavid: Just before you go any further, did you say that you didn\u2019t have the normal background that most others might have had going into a rabbinical school and yet you managed OK?\nRaphael: I managed. It was painful and difficult.\nDavid: So that sounds like a good thing that you managed without that background.\nRaphael: Yes, absolutely that\u2019s a good thing that I succeeded at what I did. That\u2019s an incredible accomplishment and when I graduated I felt wonderful. However, it continues to be that what I never learned I still haven\u2019t learned and it continues to be a problem.\nDavid: Is there a reason why you haven\u2019t learned it? Is it what you are saying that because of the way you feel you haven\u2019t done the work you might have done?\nRaphael: Well there are two possibilities, or more perhaps. One is that it is awkward, incredibly awkward, to say to somebody, \"Will you be my teacher and help me break through this language barrier?\" when the person you are approaching to be the teacher has assumptions and expectations and judgments about what it means to be a rabbi and what skills I should already have. And I have been very shamed in that process, so I stopped.\nDavid: Just before we go on here\u2026 I\u2019d like to check something out here so we can make sure of being as accurate as possible\u2026 Do you know for sure that the person you are talking about had those actual assumptions and thoughts? Have they have actually said so or are you\u2026?\nRaphael: No, they have not actually said so. I have a very clear memory of an encounter with the Dean of the college\u2026 But to answer your question, no, I don\u2019t have any actual data about what potential teachers think. I have a lot of experiences about being a rabbi and people\u2019s projections about that and expectations and assumptions. But in that exact moment, no.\nDavid: So when you mention about approaching someone, this was not a specific person you are thinking about approaching, but almost anybody? Or is there an actual specific person you want to approach to get the help to learn? I thought you spoke of a specific person\u2019s attitudes but then you said something that sounds a bit more general\u2026\nRaphael: Right, no, at this point there isn\u2019t a specific person. There is the barrier of assumptions and expectations and projections and my shame about it.\nAnother piece of this, when you asked what blocks me from learning the language, is that when I was 17, somewhere between sixth form and college, I went to Israel and got extremely ill with spinal meningitis and encephalitis and almost died. And I was caught in the language barrier at the time of that illness in addition to being half conscious most of the time, so I have incredibly negative associations with Hebrew as a spoken language.\nDavid: Well, notice right away here in the first few sentences, you have brought right out that you have a barrier which is made of assumptions and expectations and projections, that is, things that might not be very real if we were to look more closely into them. And your shame is somehow connected to this barrier of assumptions, expectations and so on.\nThis is probably very important and I\u2019d like to explore it with you at some point. But, since it has just come up now, let\u2019s just deal first with that part about almost dying and having such negative associations with Hebrew. From that experience, or rather from the negativity of that experience, are you saying now that you see the negativity as attached to the language?\nRaphael: Yes, the experience was very negative and the complication of being in a hospital in Israel during the time of such a physical crisis was also very negative and the language part was very negative.\nDavid: I mean that the negativity is attached to Hebrew itself as opposed to the fact that you didn\u2019t understand that particular language. Would it be the same if it had been Hungarian, Albanian, Czech or some other language that you didn\u2019t know?\nRaphael: It may have been, if it had been some other language. But the hook is that Hebrew is supposed to be a language that I should know\u2026 The negativity wasn\u2019t just attached to the language, it was also associated with an entire crash for me of the Zionist dream. So it was a whole complex of things that crashed and burned at that moment in my life, the language being part of it.\nDavid: By Zionist dream, do you mean \u2018your dream\u2019 as opposed to some larger Zionist dream?\nRaphael: Yes. I meant my dream. Though the larger one may have crashed and burned too.\nDavid: Just to be clear. What was the actual negative component of that experience? It sounds like you are saying that it was the fact that you didn\u2019t know the language that was the negative thing.\nRaphael: Well, I have a very clear experience of the medical staff, between their English and my Hebrew, trying to tell me something and me understanding that what was going to happen was that I was going to have a shot in the back. And I couldn\u2019t figure out why a shot in the back. Then after they did it I realized, Aha, this is called a spinal tap. But it was excruciatingly painful, both the physical thing and the not understanding. There was a lot of fear wrapped up in it as a young kid in a foreign country.\nDavid: But the point I am wanting to clarify is this: for you, is the negativity because you didn\u2019t understand the language rather than because of the language itself?\nRaphael: Right, the negativity was because I didn\u2019t understand.\nDavid: This is relevant because it sounds like you have it framed that the negativity stops you from learning it. But if, in fact, you were there in that hospital situation and it was the not knowing of Hebrew that was negative, and now you still don\u2019t know it, then the possibility of having that negativity again still sits there because you still don\u2019t know it rather than already knowing it.\nRaphael: Right.\nDavid: Which is kind of the opposite of the statement that I am not learning it because of the negativity. In fact it is the not already knowing it that was the cause of the negativity. That is, if you still don\u2019t understand Hebrew now, perhaps any negativity you have at this moment is not because of anything to do with the act of learning it, it is because you have not already learned it!\nLisa (another student on the workshop): I\u2019m missing this. Can you say that again?\nDavid: One part of what Raphael said in the beginning is to the effect that his block of learning is connected with that negative experience, as if the negative experience stops him from learning Hebrew. But \u2014 subject to this being accurate as we keep looking at it \u2014 if the actual negativity of that experience came because he didn\u2019t know Hebrew, and he still doesn\u2019t know it, then there is a very good possibility of having another negative experience because he still doesn\u2019t know it, rather than having a negative experience from trying to know it. It is the not-knowing it that is the negative. As opposed to \u2018it blocks me from learning Hebrew\u2019, it is the \u2018not having learned it\u2019 that causes the negativity.\nIn other words, if the negativity was caused by not knowing Hebrew, the solution would be to know it so you can\u2019t have a similar negative experience again because you still don\u2019t know it the next time.\nRaphael: And the not-knowing is still the source of the negativity. It compounds itself over and over again.\nDavid: A question for you. If you did know Hebrew at some future point, would that source of negativity disappear?\nRaphael: Yes.\nLisa: Process question here. Time out. Are you on purpose not bringing in the process or are you information gathering?\nRaphael: What\u2019s the process that he is not doing?\nLisa: Like could Raphael do this for himself? Again, it is that thing that you are coming up with stuff here that I wouldn\u2019t have come up with and he didn\u2019t come up with. What are you actually doing here? It\u2019s very impressive. Is there anything you could say about how you are hearing things or is it a process going on in you?\nDavid: Yes, there is a process, and I was going to go through it all before explaining the process I was using so we\u2019d have the material already out there to understand the explanation. Sometimes it makes sense to point out process tools right at the beginning of using them so the person is aware of how it is being used. Other times you need the material to come out first to have something to point out. This is one of those.\nI am pointing out that I heard a statement \u2014 \u2018the shame prevents me from learning the language\u2019 \u2014 and then an example of how his illness gave him negative associations to the language. The process was to explore that more to see if that is really an accurate way of interpreting what happened.\nSo far, as we look closely at it, it is turning out to be almost the opposite. Raphael is certainly feeling that because of that painful, fearful experience he is blocked from learning Hebrew\u2026\nRaphael: I assumed I had an emotional block that prevented me from learning the language because it is wrapped up with so much pain for me personally.\nDavid: \u2026And it probably is wrapped up in pain, but in the way you are saying it, it is like it is the language that\u2019s the source of the problem. And yet when you look closely at the situation, the source of the negativity was not having the language.\nDon (another student on the workshop): I get it.\nDavid: In other words, the negativity didn\u2019t come from Hebrew, it came from not having Hebrew, And in that sense your emotional experience is quite justified, but you\u2019ve mis-attached it to learning the language. It is actually attached to not having learned the language.\nLisa: My question is, David, you heard a sentence. I would like to go back and see what it actually was that clicked for you to say, \"Wait a minute that doesn\u2019t match what he said at the beginning.\" I just missed that. I just wondered how\u2026\nDavid: Well, I was just taking in what he said and the process was to see whether that was an accurate statement. The implication or the sense of the sentences seems like he was saying that he was attaching the emotional reaction to the language.\nMargaret: Lisa, Aren\u2019t you asking how he could do that for himself?\nLisa: Yeah, and I was just asking how David did it for himself. And how I could do it for myself. What happened there so quickly that you got to something that I wasn\u2019t even onto myself or even hearing. What was the framework that you were listening with? And you just told me.\nDavid: I suppose for me it is about listening carefully to what is being said and seeing if I can understand it from that person\u2019s point of view. At the same time, I\u2019m taking in the situation he is describing and understanding it from my own point of view. Then any mismatches between the two will stick out.\nIn other words, I\u2019m seeing it from his point of view and asking myself, \"I can see why it would be a fearful situation, but why would that give me negative associations to the language itself? Why would it contribute to stopping me from learning the language?\" Which sounds as if it is what he was saying.\nRaphael: We have got into a piece of it, but we haven\u2019t resolved the issue yet for me.\nDavid: No, of course not, we are just beginning. And this is just one aspect of the block. The other side of it, at least that we\u2019ve uncovered so far, is this territory of your assumptions about others and the expectations and assumptions you think others would have if you asked them to help you.\nDon: What I notice is that the problem presents itself to the subject, that is, me or whoever, as a glom, as a unit. Like there is this big, bad feeling for me around\u2026 whatever. And it is really hard to get objective and pick it apart, as to what is bad. And the skill is in picking that glom apart. When I listen to Raphael, I, like Lisa, am still caught up in the glom of his, \"Oh, I don\u2019t know the language, I\u2019m supposed to know the language, I\u2019m blocked from learning the language.\"\nThat\u2019s the whole big, bad feeling and I just empathetically got caught up in that immediately. I can\u2019t see my way through that at all and I can\u2019t pick out, for instance, that one little piece of contradiction in terms and see the significance. To me it just seems normal, like that\u2019s the way you use the language, learning a language, you know.\nLisa: And I think it is just a really good point because I do too. I think the way you are trying to help us to see is how to even begin to hear the words that we are using ourselves and think, \"Gee, is that really accurate\" and actually listen to ourselves.\nDavid: Exactly. I\u2019ll explain some more.\nI have an advantage from having done so much of this work that I see certain patterns over and over. One of these patterns is the misperception or the misattribution of the reaction we have. That is, we attribute the cause of the reaction or symptom to something that is not the actual cause.\nI work with a lot of musicians and actors so there\u2019s a common example of \u2018auditions make me nervous\u2019. The person is attributing their nervousness to the audition as if the audition caused it. However, if you look closely at what is going on for that person, it is not the audition itself that is making him nervous. It is his ideas that he has to do well and win the audition, combined with his doubt that he won\u2019t because he\u2019s setting himself up to have to play much better than he can probably manage.\nThese ideas are causing the nervousness, not the audition itself. And this is easy to prove because when those ideas are not there, for instance when the person goes to an audition more as a lark and doesn\u2019t care about the outcome, then he has no nervousness.\nIf somebody is misperceiving where their reaction is coming from then they have no actual way out of the problem. Take my audition example. When you think the audition is causing the nervousness, then there are only a few ways out. One way is to stop doing auditions, which sort-of works, but ends up severely limiting your professional possibilities, so that\u2019s not really satisfactory. The other way is to do something to get rid of the nervousness reaction \u2014 take some pills, do some breathing, some relaxing or releasing exercises, etc. But this is just a coping mechanism because the reaction comes back again the next time and you have to do the coping mechanism each time. Only when you can perceive the situation accurately and therefore find the actual cause, can the problem be completely eliminated.\nSo, because of my experience in helping lots of people uncover these misattributed reactions, I am constantly attuned to hearing when someone says \u2018this\u2019 is causing \u2018that\u2019, and to asking myself if the stated reasons can actually be what is causing their experiences. Or to put it another way, I\u2019m looking at the actual situation they are describing and asking myself if what was said is an accurate way of describing that situation.\nSo, Raphael, in your situation here, we have a number of elements, if I can put it that way. You did get sick. You were in hospital in Israel. You did have a problem with the language. And it was a very painful and difficult time. Those are all facts.\nBut the way you have organized them in your understanding appears to be \u2014 and process-wise, this was what I was checking out \u2014 that the difficult emotions had come because of the language, as if some characteristic of the language itself was stopping you from learning it.\nSo I\u2019m thinking, first of all, how does a language cause something like that? The language is not causing it to all the rest of the people who speak Hebrew. So how could it be in the language? This is really just the application of a certain amount of reasoning or logic.\nI can see that there certainly was a difficulty for you, but I\u2019m asking myself if the language itself can possibly be the element that was causing the difficulty? If you already knew Hebrew when you became sick in Israel would there have been that difficulty? Probably not. So when I look closely at the situation in the hospital, I can see that it wasn\u2019t the Hebrew that caused you the problems, it was more the fact that you didn\u2019t know Hebrew.\nThen I can see that it would be a very difficult situation to be as sick as you were, going through all that treatment and not have an understanding of the language of the country you are in, whichever language it might be. In other words, your fear and emotion was quite justified in that situation. It is a frightening and potentially dangerous situation to be in. And you sure wouldn\u2019t want something like that to happen again.\nSo, like anyone would, you now have a powerful memory associated with the whole situation to help you steer clear of going through it all again. That\u2019s a good thing. But it would be quite important to really be clear what precisely it was you didn\u2019t want to go through again. That is, as we looked closely, it doesn\u2019t make sense to attribute that fear and emotion to the Hebrew language or to learning Hebrew. Instead, what you might not want to go through again is being in a situation where you are not knowing the local language. So it would be quite important to be clear that if the negativity is caused by not knowing Hebrew, then that would be a powerful reason to learn it, not a reason not to learn it. So it turns around to be almost exactly the opposite of what you were first saying.\nLisa: Thank you, David that\u2019s really helpful. This is what I was asking for.\nCarl (another student on the workshop): So would it be fair to say that you are listening as much to what the person is saying as to how they are saying it, or their use of language in describing it.\nDavid: Absolutely. I am not so concerned about the language or words per se but more at what the language is pointing at. What is the understanding the person has that these are the words with which they are attempting to express that understanding? I want to get at their understanding or point of view, not the actual words.\nIf, for instance, Raphael\u2019s actual understanding of that situation was that it was the Hebrew language that caused him difficulty, then you can appreciate why he might not want to learn it. But when we explore the situation we find that there appears to be a misunderstanding of the situation \u2014 a misunderstanding which, in fact, is still causing the problem because he doesn\u2019t see it clearly. So it is essential to be able to comprehend the situation more accurately in order to know what needs to change to eliminate this problem.\nCarl: But you\u2019re not paying a particular attention to the language in order to do that?\nDavid: Well, yes, but only as a map to the territory, which is the person\u2019s understandings and interpretations. My experience, and I invite you to keep aware of this too to see for yourself, is that on the whole we express things pretty accurately to the way we perceive and understand things.\nBut it is important to check it out, because occasionally it isn\u2019t accurate. Sometimes people say things and you ask them if that is really the way it is for them and they think back to the actual experience for a moment and realize that, no, it is not actually what their experience is. But when that happens, it is usually news to them. They didn\u2019t really know that their experience was different from the way they said it was. They had been carrying an idea around that didn\u2019t match the events, but without knowing it.\nMost of the time though, we do express things pretty accurately to the way we perceive and understand things. But that doesn\u2019t mean that our language and the understanding it is expressing is accurate to the real events it is referring to. So you constantly need to keep your ears open for the language people use in order to reveal how they are thinking and understanding, and then correlate how accurate that understanding is to the actual events described.\nYou can see from this that, at the very least, you want to keep asking yourself if what you are hearing seems to make sense to you and keep checking out whether the words match the actual experience. And if the words are accurate to the way you are understanding the experiences, is it actually the way things work? Is it true?\nRaphael: So we are still in the thick of it, however, as far as I am concerned. That was a very useful insight. Then comes the contrast with my level of sophistication with the English language and the fact that no matter how much I learn I am still way behind the curve in terms of the Hebrew language.\nDavid: Can I interrupt here for a \u2018process\u2019 moment to point out another of the tools or processes of this work? We\u2019ve got an example of what I call a \u2018code word\u2019 or \u2018code phrase\u2019 here \u2014 \u2018behind the curve.\u2019 By code phrase, I mean a term that refers to some experience or situation or process in your life. You may know what you mean by that phrase, but what it is referring to is not explicitly spelled out.\nWhy I call these code phrases is because sometimes when we do take the time to explicitly bring out what they are referring to, we get information that is very valuable but that was unavailable to us while it stayed implicitly buried behind the code phrase.\nSo, let\u2019s see what comes out when we explore this one. What do you mean by \u2018behind the curve\u2019?\nRaphael: Well, I could try to describe it or give you an experience I had. Which would you like?\nDavid: Whichever you think will describe it best or explain it best\u2026\nRaphael: OK, I signed up for the very first continuing education for rabbis that my seminary has done and there was a face-to-face retreat and now throughout this year we have a commitment to study texts with a partner over the phone. So we started with psalms which were fairly easy. The latest text, the text I am working on right now is Bacchia Vechuda who was thirteenth century. I looked at the text\u2026\nJust a footnote here: Hebrew is a consonantal language. There are no vowels when you write it, unless you are either a little kid or an immigrant. So the text that I had has no vowels. If you don\u2019t know what the word is you can\u2019t read it correctly. If you know what the word says you can read it. It is sort of circular.\n\u2026So I pull the text off the internet, I download it and print it out and I say to my study partner, \"Oh, it doesn\u2019t have any vowels.\" And he graduated from the rabbinical school about three years ago and he went straight through from elementary school so he is probably twenty years my junior in age. He looked at it and he said, \"Oh, that\u2019s fairly easy Hebrew\", and he just read the first couple of sentences out loud. I have been working on those texts and it had taken me about four hours to do six sentences and I feel stupid! And I feel, why am I even bothering\u2026\nDavid: With that example in mind, can you say what you mean by \u2018behind the curve\u2019?\nRaphael: This is what I mean by behind the curve. That the expectation is that I should be able to access this text and to read it. Yes, there would be some vocabulary that I didn\u2019t know and I could use a dictionary, but it wouldn\u2019t be nine out of ten words in a sentence. I would be able to read it, get the gist of it at least and then back up and do the detail. And I can\u2019t do that.\nDavid: There\u2019s something you just said that is very important. It\u2019s my job to help you recognize things like this, so I\u2019d like to take a moment to point out what it was and fill you in on why this can be a very important tool to help you investigate this problem. As we go along, I will take every opportunity to point out these process moments and explain the tools you can have available when you are investigating an issue of your own.\nThe one I\u2019m speaking of at the moment is a very common one and is what I call a \u2018red-flag\u2019 word. In this case, \u2018should\u2019, as in \u2018I should be able to access the text and read Hebrew\u2019.\nThere are a number of different categories or groups of these red-flag words and in each category there are a number of words similar to each other. In this particular category are ones like \u2018should\u2019, \u2018ought\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, \u2018have to\u2019 and so on. You can probably appreciate the sort of similarity between these words.\nThe other categories also have words with a shared similarity to each other but with different significance, for instance the group of \u2018maybe\u2019, \u2018possibly\u2019, \u2018might be\u2019, \u2018could have\u2019, etc. There are other categories too but it is not so important right now to list the groups that don\u2019t apply to this piece of work at this moment.\nThe reason why I\u2019ve come to call them red-flags words is not because of the word or phrase itself. All these words have plenty of perfectly appropriate uses. But when you are exploring through one of your issues and you are trying to understand it, it is important that you are tuned to every nuance of the way you are thinking and perceiving so you can catch any misperceptions or misconceptions.\nSo, in the context of exploring a problem, if you hear yourself use one of these red-flag words and wake up enough to register it, you can then ask yourself, what am I really saying here? What goes on underneath that? Surprisingly often, when you do take the time to dig underneath into what you are thinking and how you are seeing things, you will find clues that help to clarify or solve the problem. So let\u2019s dig into this a bit and see what we find.\nWhen you said that your study partner thought the Hebrew was very easy and you thought you should have known it, the question I want to ask you is: did you actually know it?\nRaphael: Did I actually know that there is a level at which I should be?\nDavid: When you are saying, \"I should be able to read this text.\" Were you actually able to read it?\nRaphael: No, I was not.\nDavid: Then notice the situation here is that you have an idea that you should know it and at the same time there is an actual reality that you don\u2019t.\nRaphael: Correct.\nDavid: Also notice that these two appear together. That is, your idea of \u2018should know\u2019 comes up at just those moments when you don\u2019t know. You carry this idea around implicitly most of the time, but it actually surfaces as an experience when the idea doesn\u2019t match the hard reality.\nRaphael: But the idea is not something I made up. There is a standard that exists. I don\u2019t know how to concretely say what that standard is, however. And I\u2019m not saying that I have to be a Barishnikov if I am going to call myself a dancer, but I do have to be able to spin without falling over when I am dancing on the stage.\nDavid: So if there is a standard of knowing Hebrew, then why don\u2019t you?\nRaphael: Why don\u2019t I know this Hebrew? Ummm\u2026\nDavid: Let me ask it slightly differently\u2026\nBy the way, process-wise, we\u2019re still following through in this subroutine of code phrases and red-flag words and why it might be relevant to explore them\u2026\nSo, leaving aside just for now whether there is an actual standard, nonetheless at that moment when you have the idea that you should know this but the actual reality is that you don\u2019t \u2014 how do you feel?\nRaphael: Stupid.\nDavid: So is that the moment when that shame comes up?\nRaphael: Frustrated\u2026 shame\u2026 stupid\u2026 not a real rabbi\u2026 if I was a real rabbi\u2026\nDavid: And if I heard you correctly earlier, it is this whole experience and these feelings that then block you from getting down to the learning?\nRaphael: There are some things about the learning itself that I don\u2019t know how to do. I\u2019m hypothesising, I\u2019m guessing, that there is a way to learn a language that I haven\u2019t learned and that I am doing it wrong. I continue, as you said earlier, to repeat the same thing that\u2019s not working but it\u2019s the only thing I know how to do.\nDavid: You may not know how to learn it on your own, but if you just went to somebody whose job was to teach you\u2026\nRaphael: There\u2019s the hook.\nDavid: Is there a reason why don\u2019t you do that?\nRaphael: I have begun to do that this year actually, so I\u2019ve started to break through it. Some information here: I\u2019m taking a beginning modern Hebrew class at a college with a senior student who is an Israeli, a speaker of Hebrew. There are 5 college students plus me in the class. I am auditing it. I\u2019m learning things about the language and about language that I don\u2019t know, like nouns, verbs, all that stuff. It is slow, but it is helping. That\u2019s one. The senior student who is teaching it is very considerate and he is not judging me that I am supposed to already know this, so it\u2019s very helpful.\nDavid: But it appears that somebody is judging you?\nRaphael: Well, there is at least an internal jury that is doing the judging\u2026\nDavid: That\u2019s right. Now go back to those other moments you first spoke of. What you said then is that it is the negative feelings that come up that have blocked you from going ahead from where you are and incrementally gaining the knowledge. I am just pointing out the connection that at the very moment when you are faced with a situation that shows you the limits of your knowledge and offers the possibility of learning, these feelings get in the way and stop you.\nLet me put it in a different way, as a question. If at those moments you didn\u2019t have the idea, \"I should know this, I\u2019m stupid for not knowing it\", would you feel differently?\nRaphael: Absolutely!\nDavid: What would the difference be, roughly speaking, as near as you can tell?\nRaphael: If I didn\u2019t have the whole set of \u2018shoulds\u2019 because I am a rabbi \u2014 if I leave that part aside \u2014 I could choose whether or not I thought that Hebrew was an interesting language to learn at all. I could choose if I wanted to learn it, and I could either be excited about the learning or say I don\u2019t want to do that, I would rather go learn how to kayak.\nDavid: You are now speaking about choices you might make, I was actually asking about the difference in how you might feel emotionally at that moment when you hit the \u2018oh, I don\u2019t know this\u2019 if you didn\u2019t have the \u2018I should know it\u2019 idea.\nRaphael: I don\u2019t know. It could either be the excitement of the pursuit of learning, or I don\u2019t care whether I know it or not. I could be excited instead of scared or ashamed, for instance.\nDavid: So near as you can tell, you probably would not have those ashamed or fear feelings that go with the \u2018I should\u2019. But when that \u2018I should know\u2019 idea comes in there you end up having those particular emotional experiences.\nRaphael: Yes, and then comes up the question of what kind of learner am I and what assumptions do I make about how quickly I have to catch up and I do actually\u2026\nDavid: Excuse me, but let me point out you just said another red-flag word from the same group as the \u2018should\u2019.\nRaphael: OK, what was it?\nDavid: Have to\u2026 How quickly \u2018I have to\u2019\u2026\nRaphael: Well, there you go. There\u2019s my learning thing.\nDavid: If we take a moment to look under this new red-flag word too, does this mean that you have another idea? An assumption of how fast or how quickly you have to catch up and learn it?\nRaphael: You bet.\nDavid: And can you actually learn as quickly as you assume you have to?\nRaphael: No, that\u2019s what is so frustrating.\nDavid: Here is the characteristic problem hidden under that particular set of red-flag words \u2014 that we have these ideas of what should be or has to be.\nIf you think for yourself about those situations, you\u2019ll see that those words, that way of framing things, only come up in the moments in which the reality doesn\u2019t match the idea. You don\u2019t say to yourself, \"Gee, I should eat salad tonight and you know, I actually want to.\" You only say it when you think you should eat salad but you actually want to eat the french-fries.\nOne big reason why you need to wake up to these kind of red-flag words is that when you do go and dig under them you\u2019ll find your constructs or beliefs or ways of thinking. In this case they reveal that you are labouring under an idea \u2014 in fact a very fixed idea \u2014 that you think that reality really should be like this or has to be like this.\nThe other big reason to look under the words, is to take in that your own experience is showing you that it is not like your idea says it should be. And this is an interesting thing to take in. Your own actual experience of what happens is showing you over and over that reality is not like your idea. In other words, you\u2019re simply not taking in what your own senses are showing you!\nAnd this is exceedingly important to know. Without the wake up of the red-flag words you wouldn\u2019t think to look deeper and so you wouldn\u2019t uncover this knowledge. The words would instead make the same \u2018sense\u2019 they had always made to you and you\u2019d just breeze right past, still failing to see that you are holding onto fixed ideas that just don\u2019t match your experience of reality.\nWe found the same sort of thing in looking behind the \u2018have to\u2019 red-flag words. That you do not actually learn at the speed that you think learning has to take place at.\nNow to make the point again\u2026 Notice, when you have that idea of how fast you have to learn and then your actual speed of learning turns out to be slower, how do you feel?\nRaphael: Not great!\nDavid: You can see how having such a fixed idea about the way things should work or have to work when the way they actually work is different, sets you up for those highly negative emotional reactions.\nYou have been tending to put the blame for the reactions on the fact that you are not learning fast enough. But does it belong there? Is it really the \u2018not-learning as fast as I have to\u2019 that makes you feel bad? Is that the cause of the bad feeling?\nIn fact, when we got under those red-flag words it appears that the cause of the bad feeling is that you have the idea that you should learn faster than you actually do. This is what causes the bad feeling, not the actual speed you\u2019ve been learning at. Like the \u2018I should already know it\u2019, here we have another of those patterns where, when you look closely, you can see the misattribution of the feeling to something that is not what really causes the feeling.\nCarl: What\u2019s being misattributed then, specifically?\nDavid: Well, if you go back to when he said, \"I feel bad in that moment because I should know this and I don\u2019t.\" Then, from your own experience ask yourself directly, if you were the one saying that would you be attributing the bad feeling to the not-knowing it? As in:\n\"I feel bad because I should know this and I don\u2019t.\"\nOr if I rearrange the words to get more at that meaning:\n\"I should know this, and I feel bad because I don\u2019t.\"\nAs if the not-knowing is what is making me feel bad. But is that what\u2019s actually causing it? If you were in a moment when you didn\u2019t know but you didn\u2019t have any idea about what you should know, would you feel bad?\nIn other words, is it more true that the \u2018I should\u2019 idea is what is causing the bad feelings. Would it be more accurate to put it:\n\"I don\u2019t know it, but I feel bad because I think I should.\"\nOf course, if I don\u2019t attribute the bad feeling to the idea, I\u2019ll never look at the idea and question its validity. In fact, the nature of these patterns is that the idea of what should be happening gets reinforced each time I experience it and so gets stronger and more fixed. And once the \u2018shouldness\u2019 \u2014 the requirement of it having to happen \u2014 attaches to the idea, it tends to make reality somehow wrong because it isn\u2019t what it should be.\nWith that kind of preconditioned and ever-more-fixed idea carried into each moment, of course, it makes perfect sense for me to keep trying to change the \u2018wrong\u2019 reality to match the \u2018right\u2019 idea or getting upset if it doesn\u2019t. It would never occur to me to look closely enough to register which one is real and which one is merely an idea \u2014 and an inaccurate idea at that!\nIf you have ever experienced such a fixed idea, and who hasn\u2019t, you\u2019ll know how powerfully it sets you up to react in the same way to the next moment. Only when you can wake up enough to come into the present moment, away from all the reinforced preconditioning, can you tell the difference between real and not-real. Strange as it sounds.\nAnd only when you can actually experience which one is real, would you consider the possibility of changing the misconceived idea to match the reality. After all, how can reality be wrong? It is just what it is.\nMargaret: Where does vision come in, or making goals?\nDavid: Something that is absolutely essential if we are to understand and solve our problems is to not forget that we are dealing with a specific situation here, not a generality. What you are asking now is about a different situation than this one. Someone with a vision of what they want or someone making a goal is not someone in the middle of emotional distress or being blocked from learning. To understand the nature of that one, we'd need to have an actual person with a vision or in the midst of making a goal and explore specifically what is happening for them.\nThis is why I have said there is nothing wrong with the word \u2018should'. It has a perfectly appropriate use in the language. But, when you know you have a problem and you are exploring to find out what it is all about, and in that context those kind of red-flag words pop up, then you want to be alerted enough by them to look underneath and see if it is one of those kind of situations where a dearly-held idea has acquired the power to make the reality seem wrong and to stir up emotional reactions.\nAs Raphael can testify, these emotional reactions are not minor feelings, and they have the power to stop you from doing the very learning that, if you did it, would lead you in six months or a year into a totally different place where you wouldn't even have those feelings because Hebrew would then be as easy for you as it is for your study partner.\nRaphael: You know, I think I may have internalised something that the Dean said to me once. I was required to have special tutoring by the faculty in order to continuing in good standing in the college. And the tutor, instead of helping me to learn the language just did the translation for me, so all I did was take notes. So I've had experiences where I thought I was learning but I wasn't.\nAnd the Dean asked me one day how was it going? And I said, \"I am doing a whole lot better than I was when I first got here.\" Which was true, because I had been learning and the more I learn, the more I learn and I do know a whole lot more and after having been a rabbi for almost 20 years I am actually a really good rabbi. I don't have the Hebrew skills that I should have, but anyway that's beside the point. I have been learning and I have been growing and it has been changing.\nSo I said to the Dean, \"I know a whole lot more and I am doing better\", and he replied, \"Knowing more than what you did when you first came is not the issue. The people out there aren't going to know where you were when you started. They are not going to say, \u2018oh, he is so much smarter than he was before'. They are going to have an expectation of your capabilities from the onset.\"\nSo, perhaps I have internalised that conversation.\nDavid: Well, other people might or might not have an expectation, but what relevance does that have to you?\nRaphael: Much relevance\u2026 OK, how do I explain this?\nDavid: By the way, we are now beginning to get into the other side of what you brought up earlier about your assumptions about other people's expectations about what you should know. We didn't get into it much at the time, but the thread has led us back to it now.\nRaphael: There are pragmatic realities that I am responding to. Two situations come to mind immediately. One is when I was a rabbi for a while in Manchester and I am doing a sermon dialogue which is my style. We are doing the question and answer part with the congregation and a 12 year old child who hadn't yet had her Bat Mitzvah is learning in the day school and she's asking me a question about the Talmud and Jewish law. I don't even know as much as she knows in order to ask me the question, let alone how to answer it and here I am in public.\nDavid: You have just told us a fact. Is there a problem with that fact?\nRaphael: [Laughs] The problem with that fact is that anybody who is a rabbi should not bested by a 12 year old in terms of text studying knowledge of Jewish law. But the game is to attack the rabbi and try to score points. Because the rabbi in the Jewish world is the supreme scholar. The rabbi is the top of the hierarchy.\nDavid: \"Anybody who is a rabbi should not bested by a 12 year old.\" So is this another idea or construct you have?\nRaphael: Yes, we are back to an idea again.\nDavid: And is it the actual reality in the entire rabbinical field that all rabbis are supreme scholars, except for you?\nRaphael: No.\nDavid: So what are we talking about here?\nRaphael: We are talking about how I don't want to get clumped in with the ignoramuses who are rabbis. I don't want to be considered an ignoramus. [Laughs] OK, yeah, there are rabbis who are stupider than me. But I want to play with the big boys, I don't want play with the dumb ones.\nDavid: So what would it take for you to fulfil that desire?\nRaphael: Well, there we come to the other half of the problem. I was on my way towards the solution, but it seems that the world at large is in my way. I applied for and was accepted to study in Israel for a month this summer all expenses paid. And I was thinking, Aha, now I can learn Hebrew. I have never been to Israel longer than the time I was in the hospital. So I haven't had the experience of Israel that is so normative with my colleagues, which is to spend a year or more there.\nDavid: Sorry, but the question I asked is what would it take for you to reach the level that you want to reach?\nRaphael: Yeah, I am getting there. It takes studying and it takes studying in a environment where I won't be shamed by what I don't know and Israel is the best place to study\u2026\nDavid: For the moment let's just take it bit by bit. In other words, it would take you studying. It takes you learning what you don't know at this moment.\nRaphael: Right.\nDavid: Is there any way to get there without taking that step? The learning step?\nRaphael: No\u2026 have to learn.\nDavid: If you took the steps, the first step you'd learn a little bit and the next step you'd learn a little bit more and the next more and at some point you'd be on your way to where you want to go. But it appears that you run into something here that stops you from starting those learning steps.\nIf I heard you correctly, it appears to be those bad feelings. And what we are exploring at the moment is where the bad feelings come from. Whether they are because of these ideas of what you should have known but don't, or the ideas of how quickly you have to learn but didn't, or about other people's expectations that are stopping you from taking those steps from where you are \u2014 the simple first step that you can take?\nRaphael: Yup. Yup. The shame is very powerful.\nDavid: OK. Let's take a moment with that one. You have just said what I call an unfinished sentence. You have named a powerful experience you have \u2014 shame. But you haven't finished the sentence to say what the shame is an experience of.\nWhat is shame? What is actually going on when you have that experience? Ashamed of what?\nRaphael: This is coming back to the same place. Shame of not knowing and being shamed \u2014 actively being put down by somebody else.\nDavid: Has there actually been somebody putting you down?\nRaphael: Oh yes, all through rabbinical school. My first year instructor had a primo reputation for embarrassing people and putting them down, not unlike what happens to many doctoral students and doctoral candidates along the way. It is partly an academic game, but, yes\u2026 daily.\nDavid: I suppose one could call it a game until you look at the consequences. It might be a game for him, but how much of a game was it for you?\nRaphael: No, not a game for me, no.\nDavid: So, at the very least we are looking at extremely bad teaching. In fact, I wouldn't even call that teaching. That's not an instructor, that's more of a destructor.\nRaphael: I was well schooled in knowing that I didn't know.\nDavid: This kind of mistreatment is a very important thing to see through, because there is certainly no end of that sort of \u2018teaching' around. Probably all of us here have experienced it in some way or another. It can be very powerful stuff that can have a long-lasting effect as you can see.\nBut it has relatively little to do with you if someone else fails to see where you are in your learning and consequently fails to help you move from where you are to somewhere else. In that sense it doesn't reflect anything on you or your ability, but it sure says a lot about him.\nRaphael: So why have I taken this in and taken this on, again and again, oppressed, repressed depressed, suppressed\u2026 pained\u2026 been deeply pained by it?\n[Pause for an emotional moment\u2026]\nDavid: Well you have at least a little bit of an answer from what we've found here already. Because, notice, if you have those ideas that come up in the moment \u2014 those \u2018I should have known', \u2018I have to learn quickly' ideas \u2014 then at the very moment when you have those, they are not just ideas. There is an entire set of experiences that go with it \u2014 shame, feeling stupid, frustration. Those experiences are very real and quite powerful, and if you misattribute them and you think they say something about you, you end up actually identifying with them.\nThis reinforces the \u2018I should know' idea so the next time the not-knowing situation happens, you think the same way and have the same experience. In that sense, the idea quickly becomes a \u2018reality' \u2014 for you. After all, there is no \u2018reality' like an experience, or to put it differently, there is nothing like a powerful experience to make something seem like a reality \u2014 even if it isn't.\nOf course, the experience you are having is definitely very real, but it is not about what you think it is about. It is not at all an accurate description about your intelligence or your ability to learn, but it is certainly a very real experience.\nA moment ago you said a very interesting thing when you said, \"I am a very good rabbi, I just don't know the Hebrew.\" But then contrast that with your statements about what a rabbi \u2018should know'. And yet here you are a rabbi, and a very good one by your own admission. You just have this particular territory of your Hebrew knowledge that could be improved.\nNow take in that you have had a number of actual experiences in the past with that instructor (and perhaps other ones) who did say very direct and belittling things to you. You thought they shamed you and put you down.\nBut it is an interesting thing to consider that they didn't see the situation accurately either. They thought you should be somewhere more knowledgeable, when in fact reality at the moment was showing them (and you) that you were here not there. Unfortunately though, rather than do their job of helping you move from where you were, they \u2018put you down'.\nHowever, can you really put somebody down if where you are putting them down to is where they already are? It's only a \u2018down' from their inaccurate expectations of some sort of \u2018up' where you weren't.\nBut because of your \u2018should' ideas and these painful past experiences, every time you hit another moment when you don't know the Hebrew, you feel as if someone is putting you down or judging you even when you may not know exactly what they are thinking. This, of course, stirs your emotions up again and reinforces the feelings and the ideas.\nRaphael: Well, then I have the internal jury\u2026\nDavid: But if you feel the same sort of shame and put-down-ness from your internal jury, then you're really saying that now your own thinking has the ability to reinforce this circle and stir up the emotions you go through because of it, even when there's no actual external person putting you down. Nothing except your own framework of thinking.\nYou may not have an answer for this and there may be no way to know without trying it, but here's a question for you to think about. What might happen if that internal jury was not there judging according to the \u2018should'? If instead you simply recognized, \"Oh, here is the level of my knowledge\", and for instance when your study partner says it is easy, you might say back to him, \"Well, it's not easy for me. It might be easy for you because you had a different background that I didn't have.\"\nNotice, in that situation there is no one putting anyone down and no one being put down. There might, in fact, be sympathy from him, or understanding, or who knows what. That would be a very different situation.\nIn other words, you are right, you have the internal \u2018jury' which reconstructs it as if the same thing was happening again, when in fact no other person has done anything, outside of your own thinking.\nRaphael: No other person is currently doing anything. They have in the past, and they may quite easily in the future.\nDavid: But they may not. Notice your framework doesn't acknowledge a \u2018may or may not'. So you don't get a chance to actually find out. With that framework you automatically assume it is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again and automatically jump to the conclusion of being shamed and put down and so out come all those emotions and feelings again, even before it happens.\nRaphael: Yes, but there really is an external reality. When I go to rabbinical conferences or a study session and they don't hand out a translation, I am lost.\nDavid: That's a fact. One implication of that fact, as you said before, would be to do the study so that in six months or a year from now you wouldn't be so lost. End of the problem.\nRaphael: I acknowledged that studying and learning the language is a remedy to the situation. But I don't live in such a world where I can simply immerse myself in the study of Hebrew for a year, and even if I could, I don't think a year's immersion would bring me to the level where I should be at.\n\u2018Should'\u2026 I know, I heard the should.\nDavid: Good. That's why I'm pointing it out each time, so that you will begin to hear it yourself on your own.\nWell, I just picked those figures of six months to a year out of the air. But the point is, whatever you could do would be an improvement from where you are now and whatever you can do after that would be an improvement again. You would be doing that which is actually possible. Is there anything else that is actually possible?\nRaphael: Yes, I could continue to avoid situations that require text study.\n[Laughter]\nDavid: Yeah, you could do that. But would that solve anything? Other than to keep the same lack of knowledge there that would keep you from your desire, as you called it, to \u2018play with the big boys'? It would preclude the movement of learning, and it sounds like as long as you keep those other ideas intact then any time a similar situation came up, you would feeling the same shame \u2014 of being an impostor rabbi.\nRaphael: And we still then come back to the emotional reality which in most cases prevents me from asking for help. So let me follow though with another concrete one. I have been given this opportunity to study in Israel this summer. Given the situation, I don't know what to do. The anxiety is building\u2026\nDavid: Let's just go back to when you said the emotional reality stops you. What exactly is the \u2018reality' part of the emotional reality that prevents you from asking for help?\nRaphael: OK. So the possibility is that I will go to Israel for this program and that I will stay a second month and study. A friend of mine is the assistant director at a school in Jerusalem. She has suggested that I would love that program; the teachers are great, and you take a language exam and they assign you to a level. So I wrote back and I say, so tell me\u2026\n[pause] Sorry\u2026 emotions\u2026\nAm I really going to be able to study there, or will the teachers shame me for what I don't know?\nDavid: You are speaking as if the teachers might shame you. How can a teacher shame you?\nRaphael: Been there, had that.\nDavid: The teacher can say certain things, but the shame is your response. I can think of a situation where the teacher could say the same thing to someone else who just happened to have the same level of knowledge \u2014 or lack of knowledge \u2014 that you have, but that somebody will not have any experience of shame.\nJames: So you are saying, David, that a teacher could have the intention to shame somebody else but it is the actual taking in of that shame and accepting that attempt to shame you that causes the experience of shame?\nDavid: Yes, well sort of, depending on what you mean. Notice the implication here is that the shame is caused by the teacher. \"The teacher is shaming me.\" But does the shame come from the teacher, or does the shame come from the idea that I should already know this?\nIt doesn't even matter if what the teacher said was, \"You should know this, are you an idiot or what?\" Take my example of someone with the same lack of knowledge as you who goes into the same situation. The difference is that this person doesn't have the same set of \u2018I should' ideas as you do. This person is in the same classroom and he knows what he knows and he also knows what he doesn't know and he knows he needs to learn.\nThen if such a teacher said, \"You should know this, are you an idiot?\", he wouldn't feel shamed, he would just say, \"Well, I'm sorry, but I don't. That's why I am here for help. Will you help me?\" With a subtext of, \"Either you are going to help me or you're not. And if you are not going to help me, what kind of teacher are you?\"\nSo the teacher may be saying whatever they are saying with whatever intent they may have, but our person wouldn't be feeling ashamed unless he also had some idea that he should know something which he doesn't know.\nWhat's the shame in knowing what you know and not knowing what you don't know? That's just where you're at. That's why you are there \u2014 to learn.\nIt's essential to see this clearly, because otherwise you will be taking it into yourself as if you have done something wrong. But if you look closely, any teacher who would say something like that has a big problem. They've done something virtually unforgivable as a teacher \u2014 to make a student feel bad for being where they are. Their job is to help you, not to make you feel bad.\nBut when they've come out with rubbish like that, you tend to see it as something wrong with you. You don't see it as something that they did and talk to them about it, or get out of there, or complain because that's extremely bad teaching and it's abusive to boot.\nAnd by the way, it doesn't say a single thing about you, but says a huge amount about them.\nRaphael: So shame is a response to a perceived situation, or to an actual situation. Nobody can shame me unless I allow them to shame me.\nDavid: I would say nobody can shame you regardless of what you do. Shame doesn't came from them. It comes from your ideas that you shouldn't be where you are.\nPut another way, use my example again\u2026 If somebody went into that same class who knew exactly what he knew and didn't think he should be anywhere else, and knew what he didn't know and who was there to learn, why would there be any shame? Where would the shame be, no matter what anyone else said? How can you be shamed unless you feel that you are somehow somewhere you shouldn't be?\nThe bad teacher didn't cause the shame, though they are making the same mistake as you are of thinking you should know what you don't. Unfortunately, it is exactly that kind of attitude and statements from others that bring up the shame feelings in anybody who has this idea that they should be somewhere they are not.\nTo prove this, all you would need to do is change the way you see the whole thing and you wouldn't feel any shame at all, no matter what someone else said. You'd simple recognize what they said as very unconstructive teaching that isn't helping you learn.\nDo you see the point I am making?\nRaphael: I see the point, and as a teacher I understand that it is the job of the teacher to teach. And my experience in seminary and upper level educational experiences is that there is a culture of who knows the most, who has the most, who is the cleverest, who is the best writer, who is the whatever \u2014 a kind of academic machismo, if you will.\nDavid: Well, I would say it is more an academic insecurity. The way you have just described it is how it may look from the outside, but think where that attitude comes from on the inside\u2026 It must be coming from some insecurity or tiredness or frustration which is sitting squarely in those academics.\nAlastair: Where are we now in term of process?\nDavid: In the larger sense we are exploring to help Raphael see what it is that is stopping him from doing the learning of Hebrew. The learning which, it seems inescapable, is the only pathway that would lead towards what he wants. Knowledge of the language would be very helpful in what he does but he doesn't have it at this moment, and in the real world you can only get it by getting it step by step. But something appears to be blocking him from taking those steps, and we are exploring what that is.\nSo far it appears to be his own conceptual framework that's stopping him. Under that framework we are seeing a number of places where there are misattributions or misperceptions of the feelings \u2014 experiences that are not quite about what he thought there were.\nMargaret: You don't include history at all? The history of an adult saying to a child, \"You're naughty when you do that.\" People have had that experience of directly being shamed: \"You are a bad person for doing that, you are bad, that's a bad thing to do, don't do that again.\" The feeling has some history and that's not important for the process?\nDavid: Oh yes, and I acknowledge that. I'm the first to acknowledge that this is huge stuff. But notice, is what the adult says actually accurate? Are you actually bad? Is the kid bad because he took the cookies? Or do we have an adult here who is mistaking the whole situation?\nWhere is the badness here? In the child or in the act? Seems to me that the act of taking the cookies may have been bad, especially if he was told not to. But the child himself is not bad. So the second way you phrased that may be more accurate: \"That's a bad thing to do, don't do that again.\" That's something a kid could learn from and maybe change his future actions.\nBut the first one: \"You are a bad person for doing that.\" What can a child do with that if they take it in? Probably end up thinking his very nature is bad? Get into a struggle trying to change himself? And how does he do that? Try to be good? But if he's come to believe he is bad, that doesn't change him into being good. He's just a bad kid trying to act good\u2026\nMargaret: But that feeling is sometimes overwhelming for a person who is not able to see that?\nDavid: Yes, it certainly can be and often is. But in what context is it overwhelming? That is, why does it become overwhelming for that person? If you look closely, is it only overwhelming if you do actually take it on that maybe you yourself are bad? This is what we've been looking at here. That could certainly be overwhelming, especially for a youngster who is dependent on being loved, not being rejected for being bad.\nHowever, if it was stated accurately by the parent that your actions of taking the cookie may have been bad, then that's just a small matter of what you did for a few moments and can be opened up as a learning moment so that you can simply change your next actions. If it's just your actions and not you who is bad, why would it be overwhelming? Especially if love for the child is shown all the way through and it is just disapproval of the actions.\nIn Raphael's case, what's to be ashamed of in not knowing something? It even makes sense that he wouldn't know it, given his background. It's just a fact. Mind you, it is an awkward fact for him because he's put off learning it for quite a while now, and it will get more awkward the longer he puts it off.\nRaphael: Bingo.\nDavid: But nevertheless, it is still a fact. And an important one we cannot avoid.\nAnd if we're looking closely here it also becomes unavoidable that your overwhelming feeling of shame \u2014 not as it was years ago but as it is reinforced and recreated at each moment \u2014 comes from your framework that this is actually about you, about your intelligence or your learning ability. Isn't this clear from the number of examples when this feeling comes up and there isn't anybody else there at all except for your framework of thinking?\nIt's essential to realize that the power of these long-standing problems is not because of the past. It's because it has been recreated each time since that it is still powerful now. Or to put it slightly differently, every time that you re-experience it powerfully, it is not the past that is causing it anymore, it is your current misperception or misattribution that is responsible.\nThis is not a theoretical idea of mine, by the way. We've seen it right here each time by just exploring closely what you are actually thinking in that present moment.\nIf your \u2018I should know it' idea and that resulting feeling hadn't been recreated and reinforced over and over again in each present moment, the whole thing would have be long forgotten. This is another of our wonderful human characteristics \u2014 the ability to forget things that are no longer relevant to us.\nRaphael: You know, right now the feeling gets in the way of being able to hear you. Literally it is like the fog. The shame that comes up from that old habit \u2014 the feeling is so intense \u2014 that I can't even hear what you're saying.\nDavid: Yes, I can appreciate that from my own experience and from working with others, so there is no rush to get to anywhere here. We can take all the time in the world and say it as many times as necessary and go over it as much as we need.\nMargaret: So you are modelling this non-shaming learning\u2026\nDavid: Yes, I suppose I am. You're very perceptive.\nDon: I see a real confrontation of ideas between David and Raphael as to what is an accurate picture of reality here.\nRaphael: It is not a confrontation of ideas I am resisting. What I am hearing, and of course I may not hear it correctly, but what I am hearing is that the shame is not coming from the outside, it is coming from the inside. And if it is coming from the inside, then I ought to be able to change it.\nDavid: You can.\nLisa: What is the it?\nRaphael: The shame. The shame is coming from the inside not from the outside, But then I get a little angry. I think that you're not really hearing me.\nDavid: Understandable, but here's a chance to go over it again. If you went into the situation where some teacher was saying to you, \"You should know that, you are a rabbi!\" And if, in that situation, you were to say, \"Well, I am a rabbi, and I don't know that, and I am here to learn \u2014 that's where I'm actually at.\" Where would the shame be in that?\nRaphael: If I could see it that clearly there would be no shaming in it.\nDavid: That's where we are headed \u2014 for you to see it that clearly. In fact we are already almost there. Notice that what I just said was simply describing the facts. You are a rabbi. And you don't know as much Hebrew as you need. And you do want to learn. Those are simply facts. I am not saying anything other than facts.\nAnd another fact is that you are there to get some help, hopefully. As opposed to have somebody telling you that you should be somewhere where you are not.\nThis is important because if you are actually going into a potential learning situation like that and you happen to be carrying around these kind of ideas and feelings where you could feel shamed by someone, then you are in a very helpless position. In a very real sense, you're justified in being afraid of that situation because if those heavy-duty emotional reactions really could happen and you had no control over whether it does happen, and if it was that overwhelming for you, then who on earth would want to put themselves in that kind of situation?\nRaphael: Yes!\nDavid: The anxiety is quite literally justified\u2026 but only if the way you see it is the true and actual reality that was there.\nRaphael: I think it is the reality that is there, and I think that what you are suggesting is that my individual response could ameliorate that reality.\nDavid: No, not at all. What I mean is that if that really was a reality that some outside person could make you ashamed, you'd be justified in being anxious. And you do happen to think that this is the reality. But everything we are uncovering here shows that this is misconceived. It is not the reality. So, I'm not after you changing your response. I'm after you seeing clearly what is the reality. Then you won't even have that response.\nIt is true that when a teacher has acted toward you that way, you have had a shamed feeling. It might well be true that those kinds of bullying teachers are quite common, but how does that force you to feel ashamed?\nLike my example before, I can easily imagine another person with a very different attitude who could go into the same situation with a teacher like that and end up with a very different set of feelings \u2014 no shame at all. The same teacher \u2018does' the same thing to both of you, yet the two of you have different responses.\nWhen this happens, how could it be the teacher who causes the shame? That is impossible. It can't be. If the teacher caused the shame, then it would happen to everyone they act that way towards. But the feeling of shame doesn't happen to this other person because he has a different point of view.\nSo it's the point of view that causes the shame, not the teacher. I can't see any way around that one, can you?\nRaphael: No, well, I don't know. I don't know. I want to learn, teach me.\nI've grappled with this one. Victor Frankel basically says similar things to this, that no one can take away your humanity from you unless you allow them to. He was responding to his experience in the camps in World War II. The Nazis could take away everything from him except his control over his response to the situation. I think that he is brilliant, and I think I would have crumbled long since. I think there are people in the world who rely on being able to create a certain reaction and I am hearing you say that the response of shame is my response and that I can unlearn that response to a given situation.\nDavid: See, this is where you have it turned around for yourself. You believe it is a response to the situation, and as long as you do, you'll have that response. They go together.\nBut what I'm showing you is that the shame is not a response to the situation. It is a reaction to the framework you have that you should be somewhere else in your knowledge than where you are. It is the inevitable feeling you will have if that is the framework you bring into those moments when the reality is that you don't know the language but the idea is that you should. Anybody carrying that idea into that situation would have the same sort of reaction.\n[To the group:] I am sure you can all relate to this sort of thing yourselves.\nLisa: It's not like you're trying to change the response in a indirect way. It's understanding what it is a response of\u2026?\nDavid: Yes, yes. Showing you that with that framework of \u2018I should\u2026', you will have that reaction every time and\u2026\nRaphael: Can you say that again? Anybody with the same framework\u2026 And the framework is: \u2018I should\u2026'?\nDavid: Anybody hitting the situation where the reality is what it is and yet they think it should be something else \u2014 in this particular case where you don't know something but you think you should \u2014 would have a similar reaction because of that \u2018should' framework.\nBy the way, we are still exploring the process tool of red-flag words and why they are important to catch. Because if you don't wake up to them you can't explore under them enough to start to see how accurate or inaccurate your ideas and points of view are to the situation.\nNotice when we caught the red-flag words and did a little systematic digging, we quickly found that the problem is that you are attributing the shame feeling to the \u2018not-knowing Hebrew (\u2026when you should)'. As we explore around it more the question gets raised: can that feeling of shame be coming from not-knowing Hebrew or is it coming from the fact that you think you should and yet you don't?\nBecause, as you said yourself when I asked you before, \"If you hit that moment and didn't have that \u2018I should' idea, would you have any feeling of shame?\" And you said something like, \"I don't know, I might have feelings of excitement about learning or I may not want to learn, but shame it is not one of the feelings that might come up. Excitement or interest or boredom maybe, but not shame.\"\nLisa: Also the power of the should is that it seems the reality then becomes unacceptable. That this should is the only acceptable thing. It is not that you say that you don't want to learn or, yes it would be great to know Hebrew. It's \u2018I should', which makes the reality of where you are actually at unacceptable. I'm clarifying this for myself, but I can ask it as a question: when you are at the level you are at with your Hebrew and you have this idea that you should be at a different level with it, how does that \u2018should' idea then make the reality seem?\nRaphael: My experience of this dilemma is not a cognitive one. My experience of the dilemma is not that I hold an idea of a certain level of achievement. My experience is that I open a prayer book and the habit of my childhood of just having to try to make the right sounds is dominant as opposed to connecting to the page and the words as an actual language. So that I don't experience the language as a language. I experience it as a set of sounds that carries me somewhere.\nMy experience when I prepare my weekly Torah study for the students is that I don't access the Hebrew language, I don't access the text of the Torah, of the Bible, in its original without using English. My experience when I try to do Talmud which is mostly in Aramaic, or these texts that I am studying with my partner over the phone, is that I am illiterate. I can't access the language.\nMy experience in the Hebrew classes that I am taking now at the college is a different kind of experience altogether, which is an interesting one that somehow, since I am able to say quite easily, well, I am a rabbi but I don't know modern Hebrew. The study of modern Hebrew is not quite so loaded for me, so I am actually being able to learn the language and use all kinds of vocabulary that I had accumulated over the years and bring into this experience of the modern Hebrew.\nAnd I am having Aha moments with grammatical things like how you do the definite noun phrase. I didn't even know what a definite noun phrase was few weeks ago, but now I have learned what a definite noun phrase is and when I see it I can get it. But primarily my experience is that I am illiterate. And I am a very literate person in English and I hate being illiterate in Hebrew!\nSo that's my experience. But what David is suggesting to me is that the emotions of shame come from a cognitive framework of \u2018I don't know but I should know' and therefore I feel \u2018arrrgggh'!\nBut I am not having that cognitive experience of the idea of shouldness. I am having an actual experience of not being able to penetrate a text when I am used to being able to access the written word. And the written word \u2014 not only in Hebrew but in the Jewish tradition \u2014 is vastly significant.\nDavid: But if you are having an experience of not being able to penetrate it, how does shame come into that?\nRaphael: I'm stupid\u2026 because I should be able to\u2026 Ahhh! [laughing]\nDavid: You see, you're starting to catch the red-flag words.\nYou say, \"I'm stupid because I should be able to\u2026\", but look really closely here. I propose to you that the feeling of stupid comes because of that idea.\n\"I'm stupid because I should be able to\u2026\", as opposed to, \"It is simply a fact that this is the level of my knowledge at this point.\"\nNotice you just described a situation where your framework is more accurate and accepting of the facts \u2014 that you don't know modern Hebrew \u2014 so you can go ahead easily. It is interesting to learn and you progress. And there is no shame. On the other hand, the framework that you \u2018should' know the rabbinical Hebrew when in fact you don't know it, gives you the shame and stops you from progressing.\nIf you had the same attitude as you do with the modern Hebrew, is there any reason when you think about it, why your other Hebrew learning wouldn't be just as interesting and you would also be progressing?\nI think what Lisa was saying, or at least the opposite side of what I understood, is that if you didn't have those ideas of what you should do, where would you be but accepting where you are? Here is what you do know and here is what you don't know. You would accept that this is where you are, since it is, in fact, where you are. You could then move from where you are to the next step.\nRaphael: OK! I give up. I agree. The problem is my cognitive framework. Now what? How do I unwire it? It seems to be infused in me like a tea bag in water.\nDavid: Yes, I'm sure it is and it's something that has been probably reinforced many times and it has been reinforced all the more powerfully because there are huge emotions that go with it.\nThere is nothing like an actual experience to make something seem real, especially if you misattribute the experience as if it has to do with your level of knowledge, your intelligence, or your stupidity \u2014 until you actually start to believe that you are that. But the point here is not specifically how to disengage it, the point is to actually see that it is only an idea you hold \u2014 an inaccurate idea. It is not the reality!\nYou know what you know and you don't know what you don't know. That's the reality. And your idea is not just an idea. It is a particular sort of idea. It is not: \"Oh I don't know this, but some other people do\" or: \"I don't know it, but it might be kind of nice to.\" It is: \"I don't know and I should know it.\"\nIf you really pause a moment to think of the implications of this kind of should. What you are saying is that there is something wrong with the situation as it is because it should be a different situation. It shouldn't be this one. It is exactly saying, \u2018This reality is wrong to be this way, it should be or has to be another way.\"\nLiterately, it is a fixed idea. You are holding on to that idea very, very strongly as to what should be, and judging reality as being wrong because it isn't what should be, and then going through big emotional reactions because of this. That's the very essence of this problem.\nBut reality is what it is \u2014 you learn at the speed you learn; you don't learn any faster. To the degree that the idea is fixed, the idea will be held onto in the face of repeated experiences that show you that reality is not what the idea says. And in spite of having these experiences over and over, you never get to take in what reality is because the idea is always making reality seem wrong. Consequently the idea gets more fixed and every time you hit that situation, reality seems wrong again and isn't what it should be and this generates the shame and frustration experiences, which as long as you interpret them as being caused by not knowing the language, will reinforce you to experience it the same way the next time\u2026\nDo you see how it works? Soon you end up where the idea acquires more \u2018reality' than the actual reality. And you are stuck in an endless series of trying to change the reality to match the idea, which would be very wonderful if you could manage it. But notice, reality seems to be most uncooperative in matching itself to your idea. And through all of this, it has never occurred to you to really look at these two and see which one is real and which one is an idea. So you've been truly stuck in it.\nIf you had the tools to explore it carefully and get outside the preconceptions as we are learning to do now, then you'd easily see what is real and what is the idea. This is what unfixes the idea from seeming like the reality you think it is. Then, rather than trying to get reality to change to suit your ideas, you could perhaps operate the other way around and let the idea shift to match the reality. Then there'd be no conflict and no reactions and no problem.\nRaphael: And so I'm now wanting to resist you completely. I am seeing in my peripheral vision Rebecca stretching and I'm thinking of all the dancers I've known where there was a certain level of physical flexibility in the body and strength and endurance and grace required in order to be a dancer. If you put ten people in front of an audience you would probably have the audience saying that x-percentage of them really were dancers and x-percentage hadn't quite got there yet. I think that with the Hebrew there is a reality there. The parallel of putting myself on stage as an accomplished performer and I am not!\nDavid: Why are you putting yourself on stage as an accomplished performer when you are not?\nRebecca: Because I'm a rabbi!\nDavid: But you're not being the rabbi that you are, you are trying to be some rabbi that you are not.\nRaphael: I know, but rabbi-ness like dancer-ness has a certain set of implications to it.\nDavid: Notice you have another idea here \u2014 of what rabbi-ness is. Are you saying that if whoever is in control of assigning and/or taking away rabbi-ness knew where you were they would take it away?\nRaphael: No, they can't!! haha!\nDavid: So where did you get this idea about the definition of rabbi-ness, especially when you see that there are other rabbis that don't even know as much as you do?\nRaphael: But those are reform rabbis and I am not a reform rabbi.\nDavid: Ahh, does that mean you're an unreformed rabbi then?\n[Laughter]\nRaphael: My apologies to any reform rabbis who might be listening. Many of them are much smarter than me and have more skills.\nDavid: Let me just say something here on the process level. Something I can speak about from my teaching experience and which I think is important to mention now.\nWe were working this morning with someone else whose issue was being caught up in a circular problem \u2014 where his way of seeing things takes him around and around in a circle. When somebody is caught in such a circular issue, the problem more often than not isn't one of avoidance or resistance, though that may also be there in some cases. It is more that somebody is truly caught in something that they can't see their way out of. They are in a maze. They are in a labyrinth. Every time they think they are heading for the exit, they end up over here back in the circle with the symptoms again. It is the nature of that one until you work out how to escape from it.\nDon: Yes, and the intention is to get out of the maze, it is just you miss the door every time.\nDavid: Eventually through exploring and exposing these vicious circles, you'll know the nature of them and understand how you keep caught in them and how to liberate yourself from them.\nHere we've uncovered another bit of it. The very essence of this circle is that the \u2018should' thing seems more real than the reality \u2014 literally. Reality does seem wrong and you are not the only person in such a circle who is going to keep on insisting that the way you see it is a reality and that you really should know it. That's why you are caught in it, because you have such a degree of forceful fixedness on the \u2018should'. If you didn't have so much certainty in the \u2018it has to be like this', you wouldn't be caught in a circle and it wouldn't be vicious.\nI already know this from helping others, so I know that this is what is going to happen. That in our process here we do need to go around it all more than a few times because you do really need to take in the degree to which you hold the \u2018it should be like this'. We don't say these words for nothing. \"It has to be like this\", and you really do think that is the way it should be.\nLisa: And it should already be that now, it's not like something for the future\u2026\nDavid: Yes, these are real words, with a real meaning for him.\nDon: Do you ever bring in, say, his material that he brought in? It cleared my head when you said these \u2018shoulds' and \u2018have to's' are attached to lots of ideals and for Raphael, clearly, it was attached to the whole idea of the whole Jewish religion and the Torah and all this vast array of tradition. Is it helpful to bring that in and point it out?\nDavid: Yes, that's what I'm doing. What the \u2018shoulds' seem to be attached to is the idea of rabbi-ness. That's what a rabbi is, or should be, even though we actually have one here that is not like that. And perhaps quite a few other ones are not like that either. Even if some are, that doesn't mean that all rabbis have to be like that.\nDon: I don't know if it is only from the outside that it makes it clearer. It is clearer to me that being a rabbi is attached for Raphael with this tradition of being a rabbi. But evidently he has escaped the tradition in some ways. I mean, for instance, by not having the usual upbringing.\nDavid: How real and true for everyone can the tradition be if there are exceptions?\nDon: What I'm saying, is there any helpful way to bring this into the picture for him to bring him to an easier realisation that the should is\u2026\nRaphael: Oh, I can go on and on about my accomplishments as a rabbi \u2014 the whole shooting match. I could tell you about when I was last in Jerusalem in 1998 that I helped to create a revolution that is still going on. I can do all that. That stuff is not hanging me up. The accomplishments are not a problem. And my genuine accomplishments as a rabbi and my skill as a rabbi and my work with people, that's not a problem. This is the problem for me. This is the place that is loaded for me.\nAnd on the other hand, I would say just in my own defence. I don't know if I have to defend myself, but I seem to want to\u2026 [Laughter] \u2026a lot of the rabbis that are real text-jockeys don't know what to do if they are in a hospital with somebody who is dying or in a ceremony with a 12 year old who is about to become an adult or at a wedding or\u2026\nDavid: What does that actually tell you about what a rabbi should or shouldn't be?\nRaphael: Yeah, well I have ideas about what rabbis should be and I am a lot better at the things I think rabbis should be doing except the text stuff. But maybe that's just because I can't do the text stuff.\nDavid: Yet\u2026\nRaphael: Yet\u2026 yet\u2026 yet\u2026\nAlastair: Would it be good LearningMethods to take a look at \u2018should' and try to codify exactly what would be an acceptable level of knowledge of text, instead of keeping it vague? Will it help defuse it a little bit or is that appropriate?\nDavid: That's an interesting idea. We could do that, but then notice what we'd need to be clear about. We'd need to finish that sentence \u2014 acceptable to whom? It appears that an acceptable level to Raphael is way above where he is.\nAlastair: But it hasn't really been codified\u2026\nRaphael: Oh, sure it has\u2026 An acceptable level of text would be to be able to read it and understand it.\nDavid: Acceptable to whom?\nRaphael: To me. I would like to be able to read this and understand it, without going, \"What does that word mean?\"\nDavid: This is a fact: you would like to be able to read it. There is another fact here \u2014 that at this particular moment you can't. There is another potential fact \u2014 a probable and likely fact \u2014 that you could learn it given some time.\nRaphael: And somebody who is gentle enough.\nDavid: Gentle enough to\u2026?\nRaphael: To me. To not be hard on me when I am trying to learn it and say, \"Oh, what an idiot you are.\"\nDavid: And would you be an actual idiot, if somebody said that?\nRaphael: [pause\u2026] No, I am not actually an idiot.\nBut that was one of the fond disparaging remarks of my childhood. One of the favourite parental put-downs.\nDavid: Let's come back for a moment to the territory of acceptable to whom? You are speaking as if you can have a level of knowledge that has a property called \u2018acceptable'. But is this possible? Is the property called \u2018acceptable' attached to the knowledge level? Or is acceptance something individuals do?\nHere's where we are getting very much into the territory of understanding the nature of value systems as I call them. I'll not go into it much here, except to point out clearly that it is human beings who accept or do not accept. There is no such thing as an abstracted \u2018acceptable level of language'.\nThere is a particular level which is acceptable to somebody and a very different level which might be acceptable to somebody else. The acceptableness is a property of the person doing the assessing of the language knowledge, not a property of the language knowledge. But, boy, do we often mistake that one!\nSo if you are the one doing the accepting or not-accepting, and this accepting is being applied to the level of your language knowledge, does that mean that you are not accepting the level of knowledge you have?\nRaphael: OK. So we're back again to the actual reality I'm up against. It is true, even though I am a rabbi, and I am a good rabbi, that were I to apply to the college now to go to school there I would not have a sufficient level of Hebrew to start! And that does a number on my head, that I don't even know as much Hebrew as the students who are starting now.\nDavid: And if you were applying now and you wanted to be a rabbi, wouldn't you presumably do the work to learn it first before you'd get in? So is this a problem?\nRaphael: Aha! Framework again\u2026 cognitive framework. The dissonance comes from my own assumptions about what I know and what I don't know based on\u2026. Aha\u2026 aaah\u2026\nMargaret: I don't hear you saying that he didn't choose a teacher well. You're not saying that either.\nDavid: Well, you're right, that is sitting there too and having a good teacher would be a relevant factor in how easily and well he would learn as he's experienced with his modern Hebrew teacher. But it is not the main issue here. You can't begin to choose a teacher well until you have a framework that would allow you the presence to assess how the teacher is actually teaching. Is he or she a constructive, helpful teacher or an unconstructive, bullying teacher?\nBecause right now if the teacher said something disparaging, Raphael would see it as shaming him rather than seeing it as something to do with that teacher's way of teaching. He would not be able to say, \"This teacher isn't accepting that I am where I am in my learning and isn't giving me the help I need.\" Instead, you can bet that probably he'd be so in reaction in that moment he wouldn't be able to assess anything about the teacher. He'd be feeling it said something about him. It would simply produce another painful experience and reinforce all his ideas about his lack of intelligence or ability or rabbi-ness.\nLisa: So, David, just a moment before it sounded as if what Raphael put out as a problem about getting into college, you restated as facts about his level and then you asked if there is any problem with that?\nRaphael: Well, David said if I wasn't already a rabbi now and I wanted to be a rabbi then I would go and study what I needed to know in order to get into the college and so what is the problem? And I'm still wrestling with him and saying, but there is a standard, and here is some proof that there is a standard. The level of Hebrew I know wouldn't even qualify me for admission now and I am even already a rabbi.\nLisa: So there is a standard coming from this school to get in?\nRaphael: Right.\nDon: And he pointed the way around that fence.\nRaphael: Which is back again to the learning thing and the should thing and the framework thing and that the shame is my response to an external situation but it is not inherent in the situation. It is there because I put it there\u2026 And then I get angry.\nDavid: It is angry at\u2026, or angry because of\u2026?\nRaphael: Because then I can distil it down to it: it's all my fault, blame the victim, I am feeling the shame\u2026\nDavid: Why is there any fault here at all? Where could there be any blame? You have recognized that there is a level of knowledge about the language you do not have. That's a fact.\nYou know that this is something that would be helpful for you and something you want to do. That's a fact.\nYou have enough history, from the sounds of it, to have a certain sense about your ability to learn it. And that you would learn more and more over time if you got at it. That's been true for you before and probably would be again.\nI can't see any fault or blame in any of those facts.\nThe blame comes in when you start to compare where you are to somewhere you are not and this somewhere appears to be your idea of rabbi-ness.\nIf you just saw all those facts as the simple facts they are, you could go, \"Oh, here's something I need to learn and I could start to learn it \u2014 and tomorrow, or the next day, or 5 weeks later I will be a little further along.\"\nIf you look at it, these exact same facts just described the situation you have in learning modern Hebrew which is not a problem for you. And it's not a problem because there you have taken in and accepted all the facts around not knowing modern Hebrew and so learning it is easy and seems interesting. Why wouldn't this be the same?\nIt sounds like the only reason why it isn't the same is because of this deeply-held idea you have of what should be \u2014 an idea that does not, in actual fact, match reality. And the exact and precise extent that the idea is so deeply held is directly proportional to the amount of shame feelings you have.\nRaphael: Say that again? The power with which the idea is held onto is directly proportional\u2026?\nDavid: The depth to which you are holding this, or the intensity, or the fixedness with which you are holding this idea is exactly proportional to the amount of reactive feeling you are having about it.\nLisa: And all those feelings are what keeps you from actually taking the steps that would give you the learning that you want.\nDon: What has been a very key thing throughout my LearningMethods experience and exploration, and which I keep running into, is that every time I have a symptom feeling and I relate it to my framework the way I have learned to do in this work, it always turns out that there is nothing wrong with that feeling. That feeling is totally appropriate to the framework once I have figured out what the framework is \u2014 my belief or way of seeing things\u2026\nLisa: There is nothing wrong with the shame?\nDavid: The shame is exactly what anybody would be feeling who holds that same sort of belief.\nDon: And the tricky thing is to figure out the framework structure that keeps me locked in that feeling. And indeed when I figure that out about some feelings, I am no longer locked in that feeling because the cognitive level has crumbled or altered or shifted enough that the feeling simply doesn't come up.\nDavid: When you call it cognitive, I know what you mean. What crumbles the old framework is simply the fact that you are cognitioning, cognitizing, cognizing\u2026 what's the word\u2026? recognizing... that you are recognizing that what you thought was causing the feeling is not what is actually causing the feeling.\nIn Raphael's case, it is not his lack of Hebrew that is causing those feelings. It is the idea that he should know more Hebrew than he does that is causing that feeling. The more we explore it, the more I can't see any way around that.\nDon: But what is different in my experience from others therapies I have done is that there is no attack on the feeling in terms of trying to adjust the feeling or trying to make me feel better. There is really just an exploration about what reality is and whether am I understanding it correctly.\nDavid: Exactly, you've got it.\nWhy would anyone want to change the feeling? The feelings are your responses. They are just the symptoms. But the symptoms of what\u2026? Responses to what\u2026? Instead of changing the feelings, I'd really want to find out why I'm having them. Why am I caught in this? Why is this happening?\nIf I can discover what is happening \u2014 what the situation is and how I am thinking and the way I interpret it all \u2014 then I'll be able to say, \"Of course, if that's the way I usually see the situation, no wonder I would be feeling what I am. Who wouldn't?\"\nBut, you're right. The main point of this work is to find out whether the way you see things is accurate or true to the actual reality, or have you misconceived it? If you could take in what's happening more accurately, would you feel the same thing? If you hit that situation with the unconstructive teacher and see it for what it is, and if instead of feeling that you have done something shameful, you saw bad teaching, would you feel the same thing?\nAlastair: So is it recognition alone, does that do the work?\nRaphael: No!\nDavid: Well, hang on, have we had recognition yet?\n[Laughter]\nMargaret: So how do you know what is reality then?\nDavid: Well, that's simpler than it might seem if we stick just to this context and review what we have found. For instance, [to Raphael] is it a reality that you have the level of Hebrew that you have\u2026 and no more? That is, you know what you know and you don't know what you don't know. Is that a reality?\nRaphael: I may be underplaying the skills that I do have, but I don't know as much Hebrew as I need.\nDavid: At the moment when you look at some Hebrew, is it the reality that you don't have the level of knowledge to know what most of it is, instead you have a lesser level of knowledge?\nRaphael: That's correct.\nDavid: When you are looking at some other Hebrew and you do know what it means, then that's a reality?\nRaphael: Yes.\nDavid: Is it a reality that you see the benefit or the advantages of having that knowledge, which you currently do not have?\nRaphael: Yes.\nDavid: In other words, it is a reality that you have a motivation, a reason why knowing Hebrew would be helpful to you. You seem to recognize that. And is it a reality that you want to gain that knowledge?\nRaphael: I definitely know I want to have the knowledge. Do I know for sure that I want to go through whatever is required of me in order to actually gain the knowledge? I am not 100% sure because then I run into my belief structure that even though I am perfectly accomplished in English to a very subtle level that perhaps I really can't learn a foreign language.\nDavid: Perhaps and perhaps not. But at least you might want to find that out before you make such assumptions.\nThe closer we look, the more we uncover the degree to which your idea of what learning the language is full of these reactions and full of assumptions about other people's expectations and misconceptions that you could be shamed by others, and so on. One thing this implies is that you might have a very coloured idea of the difficulty of learning something. Especially when you put into the picture your opposite experiences of learning modern Hebrew. That doesn't appear to be so difficult, does it? You said that it was interesting?\nRaphael: My current experience? Well I had a breakthrough a few weeks ago which was that I came to the place where I was frustrated and in the past have chosen to walk away. This time instead I went to my conference and brought a book and a tape with me and listened to the tapes and looked at the books and actually really studied \u2014 really studied every day. I skipped a few sessions of the conference and studied Hebrew instead and I actually broke though a different level and I felt excited about it.\nDavid: So what does that tell you about your ability and your interest to learn?\nRaphael: Oh, I am definitely an idiot!\n[Laughter]\nRaphael: No, what that told me is that if I give it attention and daily-ness and effort, that I actually can learn and it can be exciting to chase the knowledge.\nDavid: So near as you can tell, the reality you experience in the moment when you are not caught in your shoulds and their reactions is quite a different reality than when you are. However, when you are caught up in moments of the \u2018I should have' idea, then it has a great deal of reality for you.\nAnd yet how could it be a reality that rabbis \u2014 implying all of them \u2014 should have that level of knowledge, when we have a number of actual rabbis that don't. What kind of reality is that? We have an interesting situation here where you can say at one point that you are a very good rabbi and yet at the same time your other idea says that you aren't even a rabbi. So spot the mistake. Something doesn't match in this picture.\nRaphael: There is a dissonance. There is a built in dissonance. So I am going to run right out and find myself a Hebrew teacher and not feel ashamed\u2026 he says, laughing\u2026\nDavid: Ashamed of what?\nRaphael: Ashamed of\u2026\nDavid: If you knew all the Hebrew you \u2018should' know, why on earth would you be going to a teacher?\nRaphael: Right, but we have already acknowledged that I don't know all the Hebrew that I want to know.\nDavid: So where is the shame? You are just where you are, that's all. And you would be going out to somebody to get help to move to where you want to get to.\nRaphael: I know. That's what you think sitting over there. But sitting over here I've got it hard-wired in, it seems.\nDavid: No, it may seem hard-wired, but it's not unchangeable. As I said before, to the extent that it is that fixed is the extent that you are stuck in it. And the degree of fixedness is the extent to which you take the \u2018should' as reality \u2014 \"It really is what should be.\" As long as that stays fixed, you can't move on it. Until you can question whether \u2018should be'\u2026 says who? And, of course, until you can take in the actual reality more accurately.\nRaphael: OK. In the beginning of this seminar you suggested that it was possible with this work to not only deal with the symptoms that arose, but to actually be free from the problem itself through recognizing \u2014 now I am making this up because I don't remember exactly what you said \u2014 through\u2026\nDavid: If you find the actual cause and change that, then you won't even have the symptoms. If the thing no longer exists, how could you have a symptom of it?\nRaphael: OK. Well, the thing that doesn't exist for me, the symptom is shame.\nDavid: And what is it a symptom of?\nRaphael: It is a symptom of misattribution of a cognitive glitch.\nDavid: A \u2018misattribution of a cognitive glitch'. That's a great way to put it. Well, notice that the way you'd been operating was that the shame was the symptom of not knowing Hebrew when, as a rabbi, you should. That it was a symptom of not being the rabbi you should be.\nAs we looked at it, we've been continually coming up against the possibility that your experience, which you labelled shame, doesn't actually come from this, but comes instead from the idea that you should know Hebrew when in actual fact you don't.\nAnd it comes not just because that is an idea instead of the reality, but because the idea is held as a should \u2014 that is, a fixed determination of what reality should be. But since the reality of your knowledge is not what the idea says it should be, you end up assuming that something is wrong with you or wrong with where you are and you feel shame.\nWhat we've found now by exploring closely is actually quite a different point of view \u2014 that your symptoms come from the mismatch between your idea and the reality, not from the fact that you don't know Hebrew.\nIt is very easy, when you think of it, to imagine somebody who could be in the same situation of not knowing Hebrew with the same teacher, but who does not have that idea that they should already know it. That person would hit the moment of not knowing and have no shame whatsoever. So how could the shame possibly come from not knowing Hebrew? When here is a person who doesn't know the language and he is not ashamed.\nRaphael: OK. So assuming that, I know from where you sit it is true. But from where I sit, assuming it is a hypothesis that my framework of \u2018shouldness' is the problem, how do I \u2018unshould' the \u2018shouldness'?\nDavid: I can only say what I said before, that you see that it is not the actual reality. It is only an idea, a conceptual framework and a false and inaccurate one.\nRaphael: Right. No, I get it. I mean I get it now with you, here in this place. Remove me from this place and jettison me three weeks ahead in the game.\nDavid: Three weeks ahead\u2026 Where, doing what?\nRaphael: Where, doing what? Sitting at my desk trying to read a text in preparation for my phone call with my study partner.\nDavid: Would there be some difficulty in this? There you are reading the text and are we assuming it is one of those moments when you look at it and you don't know the text?\nRaphael: Yeah.\nDavid: Then the facts are the same. The reality facts are: \"Oh, I don't know that passage. I can't go very far with the meaning of it because I don't know the words. So, let's see, can I learn something about it? Can I do the study, make the effort and then I'll learn it? Or maybe I can get someone to help me.\" In your modern Hebrew class, you've already had a good experience of getting someone to help you.\nWith this way of seeing the facts, now or later on your own, is there some place where shame comes in? Because, in this way of thinking, I can't see where it could come in.\nOr to put it the other way, for shame to come in at those moments how would your thinking need to have changed?\nRaphael: Oh, man! We're right back at it, aren't we? \"I don't know this. Why don't I know this? I should know this. What an idiot I am!\" There we go \u2014 fast track. Let's ice up the toboggan run so that it gets faster.\nDavid: You are by no means, of course, the only person in the universe caught in the grip of this one. The vicious nature of the circle is because of the powerful fixedness of that idea, the very \u2018shouldness' of it.\nRaphael: So how do you unfix it?\nDavid: We are going around again, so I'll say it again. I don't know any way except for you really to see that your idea of \u2018reality' is misconceived. It is not where you actually are. I'm speaking of the shift in emphasis from putting the \u2018should' on the idea to having what \u2018should' be on what actually is. For one reason and one reason only: because it is actually is what is! Is there some problem with what is?\nLisa: Why does it work better to see what is? In other words, why should somebody see what is?\nDavid: Because it is!\nBut you want specific reasons? Put yourself in the place. If you just saw things the way they were and didn't have the idea that it should be anything else, you'd go, \"Here I am. I don't know this.\"\nWhich is a fact. You do not know it. If that's where you are at and that's what is. Unavoidable, undeniable fact.\nThen what is better about it is that you won't have all those emotional reactions because it would make absolutely no sense to try to be anywhere other than where you are. And from where you are you'd actually be able to learn. If you learned even a bit, you wouldn't be where you were any more. Wouldn't that be better? It is just a fact.\nAt this point in our work, however, I am not entirely sure that Raphael has really seen that the idea that you \u2018should know that' is not true. That it is an abstracted and misconceived framework. And I mean really experience its unreality, not just as an concept\u2026 But we are getting closer and closer.\nRaphael: I am seeing that the idea I have that I should have the knowledge is causing me the pain and the anguish, but you have not yet convinced me that I am not supposed to have it.\nLisa: I knew there was a problem there.\nDavid: This is what I was saying. Until you can call into question the whole \u2018shouldness' of it, you will still hold that idea. As long as that idea is intact, is there any way to meet the actual reality without that reaction?\nRaphael: Well I was wondering about the question of intention. If I can react differently in the moment to the moment that seems like it could chip away at the connection I have.\nDavid: But how would you find yourself with different feelings than you do?\nRaphael: Not find myself with different feelings but there is a moment when I am going to pick up a prayer book or a bible or a text that I am going to be reading. It is not something that I encounter in my everyday life unless I do it on purpose. So there is a moment when I could habituate myself to creating an intention\u2026\nDavid: What would that be?\nRaphael: I am not sure. Something like: \u2018be gentle', \u2018be easy', \u2018hang in there', \u2018relax', \u2018don't worry', \u2018don't get frustrated' \u2018 you are not an idiot, you're smart'. I don't know. But something that would remind me to try to approach the experience differently.\nDavid: The experience of what?\nRaphael: The experience of encountering the Hebrew language.\nDavid: Notice the experience you had is the experience you had because of that idea. If you had a different idea, you wouldn't have the experience.\nRaphael: No. Is that true? Oh, God!\nDavid: Well, take that the example again of somebody who hits the same moment, picks up the prayer book and says, \"I don't understand this, well that's the level of my knowledge and I want to learn, so I better do some work on it.\" What experience are they having with that framework?\nRaphael: Lots of people have the experiences of being shut out, shut down.\nDavid: But the person I have just described, not somebody with a different idea. The person, in fact, who would be approaching that moment the same way you appear to be approaching modern Hebrew \u2014 without the expectation that you should know it.\nRaphael: So you are suggesting that we have experiences without valence, without any emotional coloration?\nDavid: No, not at all. I am suggesting that you have the emotional coloration you have because of the way you are seeing it. If you saw it differently you wouldn't have that emotional coloration. You would have a different experience with its own emotional coloration, one that was not negatively emotional. Your new experience might be interest in learning. It might be whatever it would be. It would be a different experience. It would not be without emotion, but a different emotion.\nWhen you are learning modern Hebrew and don't know something, what experience are you having there? It is a different one. It is not a hugely negative, shameful or negative. It is another sort. Same situation, but different expectations around it. The should-ness is missing and you are having a different experience.\nRaphael: OK. Now what?\nDavid: Well there really isn't anywhere to go further from this. It just sits there like the 2000-pound elephant waiting to really be taken in.\nBut let's say, at another moment you do actually pick up some Hebrew reading, a week from now or whenever you have your next telephone meeting with the person you are working with. If you are looking at the material you have got and you hit one of those moments where you don't know it, then what?\nRaphael: Then I have to decide whether I risk saying something or pretend that I know it and keep on going.\nDavid: What might happen if you pretend that you know it and keep on going?\nRaphael: Well, in aggregate I don't increase my knowledge. I do in aggregate increase the sense that I am a fraud, and I do increase the emotional responses that I've already always had\u2026\nDavid: Good, you're getting that part.\nRaphael: \u2026But I don't know that risking serves anything.\nDavid: Let's look at it. What precisely would be the risk?\nRaphael: Now we are back to the same thing. Ha ha ha!\nDavid: And it's so important that you see that! What exactly would be the risk if you say to someone else where you are?\nRaphael: The risk is exposing myself to his judgement and to my judgement.\nDavid: Well let's take those one at the time. If you were to say where you are \u2014 and notice, what you would be saying is in actual fact where you are \u2014 and if he had some sort of judgement\u2026 By the way, what sort of judgement are we talking about?\nRaphael: He's stupid! What other judgement is there?\nDavid: \u2026If he had a judgement like that, what does that say about him?\nRaphael: It says he is just normal, typical\u2026 They are the people of my universe, the people in my family, the people in my college, the people in my seminary, the colleagues I have. They are the people of my universe.\nDavid: How many times have you actually risked this? Have you risked this with your study partner?\nRaphael: Yes, I have.\nDavid: What has been your actual experience?\nRaphael: What has been my actual experience? My actual experience was that he unpacked the word for me and showed me the grammar that I was not seeing.\nDavid: So does this sound like the universe, as you call it, where everybody relates with judgement? Or reacts as if you are stupid? Because his response doesn't seem like that.\nRaphael: Are you telling me that my own experience doesn't match my assumptions about my experience and my interpretation of my experience? That is what you are telling me.\nDavid: No, I am not telling you. This is what you are telling us. I am simply pointing it out to you.\nRaphael: Oh, God! And I am supposed to be able to do this by myself?\nLisa: Not today!\nDavid: But you could start, at times like this, to actually listen to and register the things you say. Then you could ask, \"Is that actually accurate? Does that even match my own experience? I just said risking? What would I be risking? Here are these two things I said \u2014 risking or pretending. What would I be risking?\"\nIf you could really take the time to ask yourself, out would come all this stuff you just said about risking his judgement. You could then ask yourself, like I did, if that actually matches your experience? \"Have I ever risked this? If I have risked it, what happened?\"\nIf you do this, as we just did, you will quickly find, not only that you have been nurturing an idea of how universal that judgement and reaction would be, but also, and more importantly, you'd also find that your idea doesn't actually match your own experiences of what happens when you have risked it.\nOf course, you may also find that your idea has matched reality a few times when you've run into bad teachers. But, if you also took the time to look closely at those times, as we did before, you'd find that you mistook your experience of shame as being feeling \u2018shamed by' somebody.\nGradually as you gained skill at using these tools, dare I say \u2018learning methods', you'd work it all out. But first you have to learn about the tools and how to use them.\nWhat you can start to do right now is to see that your actual experiences, when you really look closely at them, are showing you that you are not living in the sort of world that you somehow thought you were.\nThis happens a lot with people and I always find it a very odd thing when we get down to exploring it. Here we are, having actual real experiences of the way the world is and the way people are, yet we also have these ideas which do not match. And so we don't really see the reality that is right in front of us \u2014 instead we hang on to the idea. Even though it doesn't match our actual repeated witnessing of the events as they unfolded all around us. Very odd when you think about it!\nBut it makes it understandable why you're kept locked in these kind of problems. Because no matter how many experiences you have, if that idea of the way people are judgmental stays dominant, you won't even notice the real experiences. If you don't notice them, they can't possibly change the idea. Even though you're having those actual experiences, you're not taking them in. Or put another way, you're having the experiences, but missing the meaning.\nSo you can't unfix it and get out of it until you have a way to uncover those kinds of ideas or beliefs and go, \"Oh, this is really the way I am thinking!\" And you need to register that the moments when you do perceive things that way, is also the moment when you get those reactions. The reactions are coming from your thinking, not from the \u2018real' world. It can't be coming from the real world, because the real world isn't really like that.\nThis is really big stuff. An ability to take in reality is essential to being able to live free from problems.\nRaphael: So why does it feel like a risk then? The actual reality is that I don't know Hebrew and if I am asking someone for more information, more information comes if I ask. How is it a risk?\nDavid: More information probably would come. Once in a while you might get a funny reaction from people. But even if that happened a few times, what is the risk? What are you risking?\nRaphael: The same old stew. Risking revealing that I don't know something.\nDavid: But that's already a fact. What is the risk in that? That's a fact.\nRaphael: But I am supposed to know it!! [Laughing]\nDavid: The circle's getting smaller now and quicker to come around. You see how it works?\nRaphael: So I would say I got this with mother's milk, I've had it so long.\nDavid: Yes, and now that we are getting down to the core of this framework it's worth investigating every little aspect of it.\nSo, why would you feel like it's a risk? Well, if you have the idea in all those \u2018not-knowing' situations that you are going to get what you are calling judgement, of course it would feel like a risk. Remember what Don said about the feelings being appropriate to the framework. There's nothing wrong with the feelings. They are an actual and valid response. As long as you're clear that your feelings are not a response to what is actually happening. But they are a direct and accurate response to what you think is happening.\nNow when you take in how your study partner actually responded, does it seem like the same risk as you were thinking it was when you were thinking of all that judgement? Is the risk the same?\nRaphael: No, it is not at all the same risk as when I was actually being graded and my ability to graduate depended on other people's sense of my skill level.\nDavid: Well, if you actually didn't have the skill level needed to graduate why on earth would you graduate? You shouldn't. But since you did graduate, presumably you did have the skill level and your teachers recognized that.\nRaphael: I squeaked. I was just over the edge.\nDavid: You may just have squeaked, but you were over the edge. And that's all the more reason, since you've known for a while what knowledge you are missing, for you now to be the responsible one and learn it. After all, it is to your advantage and you are the one who knows what you need. You may or may not need help with it, but if you do, why not go ask somebody?\nAgain notice the other side of this. How does it make sense to be feeling that it is a risk to acknowledge where you are? Which is an odd one when you think about it, because you are there already anyway. How can you be risking anything when you are already there? You can't lose something you don't have. You can't be put down to a place that you already are. All you can do, literately, is move upwards from there.\nLisa: You might get responses from some people, though\u2026\nDavid: You might get responses, but notice you wouldn't want to mistake those responses for something about you. You will probably get the response from many people, as you have from your study partner, saying, \"I can help you with that\", while some others will say, as they have, \"What, you don't know that?\"\nBut if those last ones said that, what would that show you about them? Does it really say anything about you at all? You are exactly where you are, whatever they may think and however they may judge it. But it doesn't say anything about you. You already know where you are.\nIt certainly does say something about them, however. About their ideas, their fixed ideas, about what they think \u2018should' be.\nRaphael: I still want to argue with you. I know that you are an accomplished teacher and founded this work and you teach other teachers. So you must have an idea about what it means to be a LearningMethods teacher and how much about this you have to know and how much about that. I am kind of making it up because I don't know this work. But there must be things that form a standard.\nDavid: I certainly have my sense of what would be necessary for somebody to know before I would certificate them as a teacher.\nRaphael: So, a standard. Even if they didn't know this standard, even if someone was a wonderful person and a good student and on their way of knowing that but did not yet know it, you wouldn't then certify them as a teacher under your auspices.\nDavid: That's correct.\nRaphael: And that's not an arbitrary idea that they held about whether or not they knew enough. There really was something that you as the gatekeeper of LearningMethods know.\nDavid: Do you mean just like there is something, presumably, that the gatekeepers to your rabbinical school knew, which is why they certificated you?\nRaphael: Hmmm.\nDavid: But there is another important element here of my assessment of anyone's competence to teach. In fact, I think it is one of the most important elements.\nThere is a baseline of things that I need to see someone knowing or being able to do before I would sign off on them, as it were. And one of the most important of these things I need to see is their awareness of, and acceptance of, where they are in their knowledge. Especially that they know the limits of their knowledge \u2014 what they don't know \u2014 so that they can keep on growing and learning from where they are. Because, of course, without that, they are not going to go any further from where they already are.\nIn terms of the future teacher, this element is of far more importance than any of the others. No matter where they started at graduation, if they have a ongoing knowledge of what they need to learn, and willingness to do so, they can make up for any deficiencies they may have had when they became teachers and they will inevitably get better and better as time goes on.\nSo there are two things a qualified person should have. One is the baseline knowledge which, assuming there was any kind of competence at all among your rabbinical trainers, you did have, otherwise they wouldn't have given you a diploma that says they've seen that you have the skills. The other is the willingness and ability to keep on learning afterwards to deepen and develop your knowledge and wisdom. This is what we are working on now.\nRaphael: I have a piece of paper that says that I am wise and a teacher of Judaism.\nDavid: And what tools do you have to keep getting wiser and wiser and more and more skilled from where you were? As I said, unless the school or the people assessing you were completely incompetent or were not seeing the person in front of them, you did have what was necessary to get by, even if it was close.\nRaphael: Yes I did. That's true.\nDavid: So if that is the hurdle beyond which you can call yourself a rabbi, then you are one.\nNow you yourself have recognized that you have a limit, or rather an area in which you could learn more, except you are running into this block in going ahead and getting that learning. This is the whole stuff we are exploring, which hopefully, of course, you will get through so you will be free from having these experiences again.\nRaphael: Yes, this one's a block. There are a lot of things I have learned since I left rabbinical school. Who wouldn't? You have to, because it is not possible to teach everything that needs to be known. In terms of walking into a hospital room, dealing with hospice patients, dealing with kids, dealing with elders, dealing with parents\u2026 oy vay\u2026 board meetings\u2026 There's a million things that I've learned lots and lots and lots more about and I continue to learn lots and lots and lots about it. I don't have the knots in my kishka about it.\nDavid: Notice you said that you have learned a lot more about these things than some people who have spent their time in a different direction, learning all the Hebrew or the ancient texts or whatever else.\nRaphael: Yes, I just don't care that much about what Maimonides says. note1 popup note1\nnote 1: Maimonides \u2014 Moses ben Maimon, 1135-1204 \u2014 was a great Jewish philosopher who, among many other things, argued that what is most rationally convincing here and now, however much it may go against tradition, is the way we must use our God-given intelligence to understand the natural world. Perhaps wisely for his times, he also suggested that until better explanations came along, the biblical explanation was the one he intended to follow.\nDavid: If you don't care that much, why is it important?\nRaphael: Because I can't do it!\nDavid: Yet\u2026\nRaphael: Yet\u2026\nDavid: If you wanted to, you could at the very least begin to see how well you could learn and if you did that you certainly would find out if you can learn Hebrew and at what speed that learning occurred. But it appears that you have, for a lack of a better term, a framework or way of seeing things, a way of hitting those moments, that causes such a reaction that you can't then take those steps.\nIt is very important that you understand these things. Not only so that you can get free from it personally, but also, to the extent that you can understand it, you'll have the possibility as a teacher of helping somebody else to also get free from it. Because this is not small stuff. And a lot of people are suffering under similar things and need help.\nRaphael: It is not just that I can't do it. It is also a whole philosophy about being a Jew and being in the hierarchy, you know, the whole\u2026 So it is not just that I can't read it in the original, it is that I don't really care that much about how the Aristotelian ideas moved into Judaism and the interpretation of Jewish law though this particular guy Maimonides who was a heavy hitter. note1 popup note1 The whole system of thought doesn't intrigue me and doesn't appeal to me and I don't really care that much.\nDavid: So what's the problem in that?\nRaphael: Yes right, what is the problem? I don't remember anymore.\nDavid: If what you are actually saying is that that is not that important to you\u2026\nRaphael: I still would really like, when somebody says to me when did Maimonides live or what does Jewish law say about blah-blah-blah, or what do Jews think about ya-da-ya-da, that I have a cognitive basis out of which I can respond and say, well if you were to look in such-and-such a place it says so-and-so, rather than feeling like, \"Oh my God, I don't know the answer to that question. I'm failing yet again!\"\nDavid: OK. It is one thing to know those things and you might, if you are interested, learn them. But if in fact they are the ones asking and they are the ones interested, do you have to know it in order to tell them where they can go to learn it for themselves if they wanted to?\nYou say that you are not even interested in it. Why would you want to know something you are not interested in if there are other things you would rather do?\nRaphael: Because I am supposed to\u2026ha ha! I am a rabbi. There is a certain body of knowledge I am supposed to have mastered.\nDavid: Says who?\nRaphael: I don't know. I don't remember any more who said it.\n[Laughter]\nDavid: I can tell you one person I have heard say it.\nRaphael: Who might that be?\nDavid: One of those wise rabbis\u2026\n[Laughter]\nRaphael: It really can't be this vicious a circle can it? I like his vicious circle better [referring to a previous piece of work]. It was his!\n[Laughter]\nDavid: If you are not even interested in that whole ancient text territory, does that mean that, in fact, that territory is not as relevant and important to you as some other territory?\nRaphael: Yes, in fact, that's true. It was true when I was studying in rabbinical school and it continues to be true.\nDavid: Is that not a valid point of view? One that could also be stated to somebody who might have a different emphasis. If that's really your point of view of what's important, what does it matter what somebody else's point of view of what's important is? I am asking that as an actual question\u2026\nRaphael: I'm not an academic in the field of Jewish studies who is studying a piece of the 4000 years worth of tradition that I am most interested in and becoming expert in that, but I do carry a responsibility by becoming a rabbi. By choosing to be a rabbi, I do carry the responsibility of passing on the tradition, even though in my passing it on I automatically interpret it. I automatically filter it through my sense of self \u2014 my present moment self \u2014 which is different than who I was 20 years ago.\nDavid: If that's your sense of your responsibility, then why not carry it out?\nRaphael: Because I am a tired middle age guy and there is only so much I can keep learning and knowing and passing on. That sounds kind of lame.\nBecause I can't know it all. That's true. Nobody can know it all. I am happy to look it up for you. I'll tell you next week. How's that?\nDavid: Why can't they look it up themselves?\nRaphael: I am happy to tell you how to look it up. Go, leave me alone. Go learn it yourself\u2026\nLisa: Ask if there's anyone in the congregation who knows.\n[Laughter]\nDavid: Yeah, there's a little 12 year old girl up in Manchester who knows\u2026\n[More laughter]\nDavid: There's something else too, when you are talking about passing on a 2000-year old tradition. There may well be a tradition and the tradition needs carrying on if it is to be kept alive. But do you have to be the one that does that particular text part or are there others who could do that bit \u2014 the ones who are interested in it? As you put it, can one person do it all or is it a shared thing?\nRaphael: It has to be shared.\nDavid: So if it has to be shared, and some people take on some parts of it and other people take on other parts of it, which sort of elements would make more sense for you to take on? The things you are interested in and think are important or the things you don't think are important?\nRaphael: Well if you put it that way\u2026\n[Laughing]\nDavid: If we all took on the responsibility to do the things that we are the most bored by, that would be good, wouldn't it? That would really be equal.\nDon: Well somebody's got to do it.\n[More laughing]\nRaphael: I am almost angered by some of the stuff I'm reading now. That's not necessarily boredom. That's the question.\nDavid: Angered by parts of the tradition you mean?\nRaphael: Yes\nDavid: Maybe certain parts of the tradition shouldn't be passed on. Depending on what we mean by tradition, certainly some parts of some traditions shouldn't be passed along, unless we want the same things happening now that happened in the past.\nDon: Can I ask you a question?\nRaphael: Of course! I am a rabbi, you can ask questions.\nDon: Are there texts that you are deeply interested in knowing how to read in the original?\nRaphael: Yes. I could read traditional texts that I am interested in. This is like, do you want to read Aristotle or Plato or Shakespeare or Beowulf, that's what we're talking about. But the question is not which writers and what is their viewpoint on the world and what would they say, for instance, about women, but are you able to read the text, are you able to look at the printed squiggles and decipher, decode, translate\u2026 Forget about whether or not you like it \u2014 can you read it?\nDavid: Let's take a little step back to see where we've come to. Process-wise, as you go through these things you want to be assessing whether the territory that has been revealed is sufficient to cause this problem. There may or may not be something more that emerges later, but in a very practical sense in terms of a piece of work, you've then found something that you can work with.\nAnd in this piece, there is a huge territory in what has come up \u2014 in these \u2018shoulds' and the idea of rabbi-ness. This is big stuff.\nFor the rest of you, if you can put yourselves in his place and think, \"If I was the one who was in this situation and who had these ideas and these experiences, would that be sufficient to generate the same feelings and stop me from learning?\"\nOne of the main characteristics of this circular thing is that by its very nature it is hard to pin down. By its very nature it will go around like that, which is quite different than some other kinds of issue where you really can get a focal point and follow it straight through to a resolution.\nBut in circular problems we inevitably keep going back to the same places because that is the way they work. There is no escape from that one until the illusion is seen through. It is just a question of bringing out the central misconception and revealing it again and again in all its detail, until the person themselves begins to make the connection. It is like the penny starts to drop when they can see it for themselves: \"Oh yes, I do see it now \u2014 when I have those thoughts again, I have those feelings again and that moves me onto the next part\u2026 Aha!\"\nI say it that way because I've run into these circular problems a lot. It is in the nature of it as a piece of work that it takes longer in terms of time to go through. I find them quite interesting, in fact, because often it is very subtle and slippery and even with my experience, it takes me a number times going around the circle before I go, \"Hang on, aren't we coming back to the same thing again? There's something circular here.\"\nOf course the main point is not my understanding, it is to help the person whose issue it is to understand what they are caught in. Showing the circularity is an important part of understanding what reinforces the issue. But I agree with Raphael, though, that the main element is what stops him from learning. And this seems to be that red-flag \u2018should' \u2014 how the world should be, compared to how it actually is.\nAlastair: This is really very powerful, because it keeps, really courageously I think, just going right back to it and back to it.\nDavid: I think I know what you mean. We have more days coming up here, and one of the advantages of having a number of people sharing those days is that you will witness a number of different issues, which are really quite different issues with quite different problems with potentially quite different solutions.\nDon: What I have been working on for some months in terms of using this work myself is coming to a practical approach in my life that is not run by ideas of my life but run by the experience of my life.\nThis whole question about how change happens is quite curious for me in terms of what happened with my problem when you helped me get rid of it in one session because it is just mysterious. I've experienced a couple of little things like that on my own where I've gnawed at it and worked on it and worked on it and been rigorous, but I can't say at the end of it that I know what I've done. But then something happens and I realize, oh this is very different and I am not any longer caught by that. I can't really say that those ideas and explorations that I went though added it up to that uncaughtness, but somehow it happened.\nDavid: It is a funny one. You may not know the exact mechanism by which the change took place. You may not even be able to say with any degree of certainty that in any one time the process you went through actually caused that outcome.\nThough, we can definitely see that in following this process over enough times we do get relatively consistent kind of changes taking place. And so, something must be going on here, even if we don't know exactly by which mechanism it is achieved.\nSometimes the change is quite obvious and you can see it in an actual activity like the person was doing with their martial arts yesterday. These ones are quite different and very concrete. However, at other times, the main learning comes as a realization that gives you a different point of view on experiences that you have.\nSo it appears to be in these vicious circles. In these, the point is just to get everything out there on the table clearly enough to see the circularity of it. That you can begin to see that there is something about this whole thing that keeps you going around in circles so that it can't get resolved. The point is to bring you so that you no longer perceive each of those steps as being somehow real, but rather see them as steps that drag you back and reinforce the circle.\nThis takes the power out of them. That habit can only keep going so long as it can convince you that it is \u2018reality'. Even at the moment that you can question it and begin to suspect it, it has lost its main hold over you.\nWe could probably stop relatively soon now. We've gone as far as we can go for today with this piece and we'll see where Raphael is with it tomorrow or the next day when he's had some sinking-in time.\nWe're at the end of our red-flag subroutine now. Pretty much everything we uncovered came out of noticing that red-flag word \u2018should' and all that was implied in it. I hope you can see how valuable it has been to be able to wake up to it and follow it like a thread off into the unknown. Eventually that thread ravels through the whole issue and led us here.\nWe've done two days out of five and we've had three pieces of work. I would like, of course, the opportunity for everybody in those next days to have an opportunity to bring up something.\nGoing through more and more pieces of work will highlight some of the kinds of traps that keep us in our problems. We will have more and more shared moments to have a basis upon which to see what happens when we bring our attention systematically and rigorously to the problems we have.\nOf course, one workshop may only show you one example of a particular sort of problem. But there's nothing we can do about that unless we want to make up non-existent problems. I get to see the whole range of examples because I see them over and over again in different workshops, and those of you who have been here a few times will be expanding your experiences of what's underneath these issues.\nIt was interesting for me, and a surprise, when I started to exploring this way years ago to find that there were not an infinite number of problems. It soon became clear that there was a relatively small handful of quite common issues that came up over and over. And conversely, a relatively small handful of tools needed to change things.\nWe've had a number of those tools come out already and you'll have more opportunities over the next days to recognize them and learn how to use them.\nSo let's finish for today and if any thoughts or insights come up for you tonight we will start tomorrow morning by looking at them.\nFollow up \u2014 next day:\nRaphael: I did do some studying this morning and last night, and I did notice that I had much more of a curiosity of what the words meant and far less of what an idiot I am that I don't already know this. So, a shift has begun, certainly.\nAnd also, I don't know how this came in, but I have somehow developed more compassion for myself because I am reading the translations in the English and this stuff is fairly impenetrable even in the English! So all the more so how difficult it is in the original language because it is not my language. It's like reading Aristotle.\nThe stuff that I am working on right now is very complex philosophical material coming from a entirely different world view about the body and the soul and God and all that stuff. And I don't necessarily understand it in English, even if I understand the words.\nDavid: Entirely different writing style from that period too.\nRaphael: Absolutely. Right now I'm at least not going, \"Ahhhhhh, what an idiot!\"\nIt reminds me that at the time when I went to my particular rabbinical school we were required to get a Masters degree in a non-Judaic discipline in a separate institution in order to qualify for graduation. I got my masters in counselling from another university, which was Catholic, so I'd go from all day in Jewish world, take my yarmulka off and drive across the city and go to the world of the crucifixes and collars. I remember thinking, \"Oh, this will be a piece of cake, at least everything is in English.\" Just because it was in English doesn't mean that studying masters-level material in any field was easy.\nDavid: Notice some things here, if I can recap a bit from yesterday. I'll use an image. Here you are in the landscape of your life like a explorer or a discoverer. You are where you are at the moment, knowing what you know and not knowing what you don't know. But you used to think, \"Oh, I should be way over there on the top of that mountain way out ahead of me, five miles away, and I'm still here down on the plain with all these things I have to get past in order to get there.\"\nIf you have the framework, \u2018I should be way up there on that mountain', notice all the stuff that you have to get through to get there. There's a huge amount of it and you can see why you'd be thinking, \u2018Oh, I am stupid. I don't have all of that.'\nWhat you are now experiencing sounds quite different. Now you are more just where you are and in front of you there is the next tree or the next little stream you have to cross. Is that such a big deal? That's not a big thing and you don't have to feel stupid because you are only trying to do that little bit at that moment.\nSo, of course, if you have your old point of view it makes sense that you would be thinking and feeling those negative things. But now your changing point of view is automatically giving you a different set of experiences and therefore different thoughts and feelings. You are starting to take in your own experience and it is showing you something different. It is no more, \"Gee, I'm stupid.\" It's, \"Oh, I can see that. That's kind of interesting. I have just learned that bit.\"\nRaphael: And the mountain loomed so large that you fool yourself about how far you have to go to get even to the base of the mountain because it's so huge and you see it from so far away.\nDavid: And you also only tend to see the mountain, you don't really see all the nice stuff around you at the moment. What you already have \u2014 the butterflies and the fish and the little Hebrew words jumping in the stream\u2026\nFollow up \u2014 second day after:\nRaphael: I continue to have different experiences when I am studying now and it is really quite phenomenal.\nDavid: Tell us. It sounds interesting.\nRaphael: Well, it is not unlike writer's block. That is, staring at the empty page you get negative feelings about that. Staring at a Hebrew page I used to get a whole set of feelings about it \u2014 shame, frustration, embarrassment, judgement about my innate intellectual capacities. And now I am simply bringing curiosity to it: \"Well, how does this work.\" It is just a language. I can decode this. I can decode English to an incredibly subtle level and tune into myth and poetry. I love that stuff.\nSo it used to be a frustration about not being able to do it. And I am not feeling ashamed anymore about it. I am not feeling ashamed about it sitting by myself with it.\nThe universe operates in interesting ways. I used to live here in this city, I grew up here so I have a few friends that are still here and yesterday I called this friend who was very intensely involved in my life for the three or four years before I went to rabbinical school. She didn't answer my phone call, and, OK, she is a little spacey and we see each other once every two years even though I come here regularly\u2026\nAnyway, she got my phone message at 5:30 yesterday morning in Heathrow airport on her return from Israel so she connected with me yesterday here when she got back and we said we'll get together later. She is also a PhD psychologist. So went we got done with all the catching up we started talking about the work I did yesterday.\nI tried to describe it in the abstract which didn't work at all. So I said, \"Oh well, I'll tell you what I did.\" To the best of my abilities I recapped what happened although I was so inside it I really don't know what happened, but I do know the outcome of what happened. She was totally intrigued by, a) the fact that I was ashamed and embarrassed and, b) the fact that my Hebrew skills were as small as they are because I had covered it up and she had no idea.\nShe was just fresh from Israel so about every sixth word was Hebrew because if you are fluent the process doesn't completely switch over yet. She said a couple of words that I don't know. I actually was able to ask her what the words meant that I didn't know. And she just simply said what they meant. Or then once in a while she wouldn't know and I would say, \"Well is it related to this?\" And she would say, \"Oh yeah, you are really getting the language. It's the same root, but no, it is not that form, it's this form and it's colloquial.\"\nI don't know, now I am just rabbiting on. But we were talking and I was saying, \"Oh, that's got a mapiq in it.\" And she would say, \"Huh?\" And I said, \"Oh, that's the little dot inside the letter that indicates whether it's locative.\" And she said, \"Huh?\"\nSo she doesn't know grammar either, but she's fluent in Hebrew\u2026 And she's not dumb\u2026 Except that I know a lot more grammar than she does\u2026\nThen I said, \"Last week I finally understood the definite noun phrase and how you form it.\" And she went, \"Huh?\" And I said, \"You know, the definite noun phrase where you put a he in front the word and then the word that follows because the adjective in Hebrew follows the noun, but in English it precedes the noun.\"\nAnd she is going, \"I don't know this stuff.\" And I said, \"Well, I didn't know it either, but don't I need to know this?\" And she said, \"No, you don't need to know this kind of stuff! Just go there and learn to speak it!\"\nSo I'm trying to wrap my head all around this grammar stuff that I don't even understand in English, as the doorway to the language, and here is somebody who is totally fluent in it, totally acculturated to it, completely thinks in it\u2026 dreams in it... And she doesn't know grammar! So what\u2026?\nBut my first encounter at rabbinical school was this absolute *&%@# professor for whom grammar was the thing, and if you didn't know grammar he would just really rip into you. And it's not only about shame, it's about competition. I made that other leap.\nThere is a tremendous amount of competition about who knows what, and can you quote it, and where's the source and who said it first. So the feelings of shame are not just in the framework in which I first spoke about them, but the piece about competition is really important \u2014 which I haven't explored yet but it just sort of went ding, ding, ding. Anyway my inner landscape is shifting, quite a bit.\nDavid: It may have been implicit in what you said, but you said you were able to ask her about the words you didn't know. Is that different than you would have done before?\nRaphael: Yes, I would have pretended that I knew them. I wouldn't have asked because I would have been embarrassed to ask because I would have been ashamed that I didn't know, so I would have not found out. But now I understand that the not-knowing isn't a problem. It was wonderful! It was delightful!\nJames: What went through your head at that moment?\nRaphael: Oh gee, I think I will ask what it means. What a concept!\nDavid: In a way it is kind of obvious\u2026\nRaphael: Totally! Like, duh, what's the matter with this picture!\nDavid: It's obvious when you see it from the other side. But the old framework puts you in a place where it is virtually impossible to see it. And it's impossible to learn too, either because you are overwhelmed with these negative feelings or because the whole thing is preconceived in a way that the last thing you'd do is ask and learn something. Instead you'd cover up.\nBut with a different framework, suddenly there is curiosity, there is interest. You ask, you learn. You gain new insights like that grammar might not be the most important thing. Learning is bursting out all over the place so it's a reinforcing circle, a constructive circle\u2026\nRaphael: Positive reinforcement!\nDavid: And this is reinforced now because it's fun, it's interesting and you're getting somewhere, and that's makes it easier the next time.\nRaphael: Very exciting, to be excited about it! Wooo!!\nDavid: You see that can happen quite quickly \u2014 one or two days. It just means breaking though the illusion and seeing\u2026 Seeing what\u2026? What did we do that other day?\nWe spend the major amount of the time going around and around, showing each time how the way you had attributed those negative feelings to the not-knowing Hebrew just wasn't accurate. Instead each time around, the cause really turned out to be the \u2018I should have known' ideas.\nRaphael: Right. Absolutely.\nDavid: That's the thing that causes the feelings. Once you get can past that one, or detach from that one, the whole thing starts to crumble.\nDon: You are saying that after he detached from the \u2018I should', \u2018I have to'? And how did he do that?\nDavid: Put the other way around, notice every time that \u2018should' thought is there with the power of \u2018I should have known this already', the feelings will be there.\nRaphael: All by myself, with nobody else in the room I use to be able to make the circle happen. Now I don't want to, so why would I?\nDon: What's your experience of how you detached from that, from \u2018I have to', \u2018I should'?\nRaphael: What's my experience of it?\nDon: Yes or your thoughts about how that became detached. David says it is very important and I can see why it is very important. I was wondering how you achieved it?\nDavid: Can I say something? Personally, I think it is immaterial how that happens. Or rather, there are two answers. I could tell you precisely how it happened in the sense of the means we used and that's precisely and exactly what we did that afternoon. We just kept at it and kept at it, round and round the circle. That's manifestly how it happened. We can play the tape back and hear it there and we can do the same thing with another person and it would probably happen again.\nDon: By keeping at it? By keeping at the one idea of the should?\nRaphael: There is an internal connection I had between the cognition and the feeling bundle. And what I have experienced though a system of logical questions about what actually is happening, is that there was a disconnect made\u2026 No, it frayed, it didn't disconnect.\nWhat happened in the experience here was that a fraying began between the ties that bind the cognition and the feeling bundle. And what happened by myself later is that the tie broke because it had been weakened, because I was able to notice what was going on, because I kept at it, because I have a phone call planned for Thursday afternoon with my study partner so I am still looking at the text.\nDavid: I think you said it beautifully there \u2014 the fraying between the ties that bind the cognition and the feeling bundle.\nThese circular things keep rolling, and have the power they do only because we do believe that that's the way that it is. As long as it can convince you it is a reality, you are subject to the belief and there is no way out of it.\nWhat I am doing is helping you do an exploration to find the mismatches between the idea and the actual reality and then embark on a calling-into-question in such a way that something about that mismatch is planted in there that can't be refuted each time we go around. In this case it was the question, \"What about the person who, in the face of the disparaging teacher, is not affected because they don't have any \u2018should' ideas and they can see it as the teacher's stuff?\"\nThat question sits there like the 2000-pound elephant of unavoidable fact in the pathway of the circle and each time around you are going to run smack into it. There's really no way around it because within your circular framework it is that disparaging teacher who is doing the shaming so it would be impossible that this person wouldn't be shamed, yet here he is not being shamed. And the only difference between him and you is that he doesn't have the \u2018should' idea. How can this be?\nAs you can see from the other day, I had to plop that elephant down there quite a few times and you had to run into it quite a few times, but since it cannot be refuted, and provided it is not ignored, then sooner or later the whole edifice of the framework will begin to crack, or fray as you put it so nicely. Once it can no longer succeed in pretending to be reality and once doubt about it enters, it is doomed.\nRaphael: I can tell you where the fraying begin. The fraying began with the question, \"What does it have to do with the Hebrew language? If you would have been sick in Hungary, would Hungarian be the problem? You had this traumatic experience of illness and were almost dying in a foreign language and couldn't communicate, but would you continue to have a thing about Hungarian? Would you still be pissed about Hungarian?\"\nSo that was the first question that began to fray the cord which was such a tightly-bound bundle.\nDon: What to me was actually the most mysterious part of that was after the first paragraph from Raphael right away you put the question, \"Well, you say the problem comes from the language, but is it the language that is problematic or not-knowing the language that is the problem?\" And that was so surprising to me that you went at that little piece.\nDavid: Let me see if I can explain why that stuck out for me. When you are working with your own issue or helping someone else, you're tracking the precise details of that particular content. And you want to recognize when you have a situation where your beliefs or constructs have gone past the territory of \u2018belief' for you and entered the territory of \u2018reality' with quote marks around it. Only, normally, you don't know it has quote marks around it \u2014 you think that it is \u2018Reality' with a big \u2018R'.\nUnless you are able to question the validity of your belief, nothing will change. Instead you will be trying to find ways to cope with this \u2018reality'. However, by the very nature of these circular frameworks, it's not so likely that you yourself will be able to question your own beliefs. You are so caught in the illusion that it is probably the last thing you would think to do. You saw how much I had to keep at it in the face of Raphael trying to convince me it really was a reality.\nSo, until they learn how to do it for themselves, most of the time someone caught in such a circle will need help from another person who is tuned to recognizing mismatches and who can then begin to question it with them, \"How can this possibly be the way that you think it is?\"\nThat's a process of questioning where you are going to have to look at it closely enough to see what's really happening, to get past the insistence or past the assumption of reality. In the beginning, you're going to need someone who is skilled at keeping at it until the seed of doubt is planted and begins to take root, until that huge elephant of fact is firmly squatting in the pathway and won't move.\nThat serves the purpose of jarring you out of the illusion. Once you can call it into question and you yourself are able to look at it clearly it won't take you long \u2014 it wouldn't take anybody long \u2014 to actually see that everything isn't what they thought it was.\nDon: Right. I've experienced that.\nDavid: And then the whole thing rapidly falls apart because it can only keep going as long as long as it can convince you that it is a reality. Once there is a slightest crack in it, it will sooner or later spontaneously break apart and disappear. Here is where there is an analogy with that example I often use of being in a train in the station and thinking you are starting to move when it is actually the train beside you. Your first interpretation breaks down as soon as sensory information comes in that violates it. The violation of your interpretation that you are moving is the fact that you look though the windows of that train and the station isn't moving.\nSo when even just the slightest fact can be brought in that violates your circular interpretation and if that fact stubbornly cannot be refuted, then your interpreting system can no longer keep up that old interpretation because something doesn't match it and cannot be fitted in, no matter how many times it tries. And it will try many times as you saw.\nBut eventually, and usually sooner rather than later, the old inaccurate interpretation will just spontaneously fall apart and a new possibility will arise to take its place. And, by the way, the new interpretation will be more accurate or more true because it will have taken account of this new and more accurate fact.\nYou really only need one undeniable and inescapable experience of something different for things to change \u2014 for instance where you were able to ask your friend about the meaning of those words and didn't feel all that shame. After this, you simply cannot maintain a certainty about the old \u2018reality' any more because something just happened that is impossible in that reality.\nThen, of course, the thing that really gets change moving is that once you've got the crack in there, and actually start to see things more accurately, you automatically start to have difference experiences. And with actual new physical and emotional experiences, then it is off and running because once you look at those unknown Hebrew words and go, \"Oh, this learning is kind of interesting\", you've got curiosity and interest there instead of shame.\nShame catches you up in your own emotions, drags you into a repeat of the past and forces you into reaction to your own experience. It begs for avoidance and pretending you know which blocks your learning.\nBut curiosity and interest take you out of yourself towards the language and the meaning and draw you on find out more. The more you follow your interest, the more you then get nice experiences like new insights, discovery, learning, accomplishment and so on. These reinforce the new approach further and so on\u2026 These new experiences also serve to disprove the old ideas that you are stupid and a slow learner.\nThere's nothing like a positive experience to get us wanting to go towards it. Problems we want to go away from, but high-value experiences are just as powerfully reinforcing, but in a good way.\nThink for a moment\u2026 In another few weeks or a month or two looking back on it, you are going to go, \"Whoa, how could I ever have seen things that way \u2014 this seems so obvious now.\"\nRaphael: It already seems that way. And I've been stuck in this\u2026 I started rabbinical school in the late 70's and I was sick in Israel in the early 70's.\nDavid: And yet, of course, when you are caught in it, it doesn't seem obvious at all because the other \u2018reality' seems so self-evident. If you get a chance to listen to the recording of this piece, it will be quite interesting I am sure. You will see the number of times you tried to convince me it was true\u2026\nRaphael: \"No, I refuse to acknowledge what you are saying!!\" You're right.\nDavid: So there is that intense power that keeps it rolling because of the belief reinforced by the reaction experiences. But, lucky for us, these things can be cracked apart very easily really.\nLisa: Easily? It didn't seem that easy.\nDavid: Well, easily\u2026 What are we talking? A few hours and a few words, versus thirty years of problem. We are not talking five years of weekly therapy, we're talking an afternoon.\nOf course, we can't say yet that you've completely solved your problem here. That will only become clear in the next weeks and months. And, by the way, I'd be very interested in hearing how it goes for you.\nHowever, you can see that by using these tools, most of the time it is not a big deal to find what the cause is in the first hour. Sometimes the working through spontaneously changes the whole issue, like this one did. Other times, the resolution is a further practical thing that people need to meet in their daily life over a bit of time before becoming actually liberated. But when it happens, it is a liberation. You simply don't have that problem anymore. It just won't be there. It is gone. You don't need any coming back for further help in this matter. You are free.\nRaphael: And it only costs some money.\nLisa: That's right, what a deal!\nDavid: Ah, and you've got a bonus because the money also covers all the other learning in the other four days of the workshop.\nRaphael: It is just phenomenal! And I'm interested too to see what happens. It makes me more curious about the things that I brought up the first morning which I thought were going to be easier to deal with, but I figured that as long as I was going to be here, I may as well go for the gold. And I'm glad I did.\nSo thank you very much. And I am curious to hear the recording because I only have a vague sense of what took place.\nDavid: Raphael, I think it's wonderful what you've come to.\nRaphael: Here's something else that is also very interesting\u2014my rabbi head is now moving into place...\nWe're coming into spring and the next holiday is Passover which is this whole mythical structure about freedom. I'm going to the city where I had my first pulpit and had some wonderful and some extraordinary difficult experiences. And I am going back not to my pulpit, but one of the members of my previous congregation sort of started her own thing, so I am going to go for a gig for the Sabbath before Passover and I will be talking about freedom and liberation.\nI had in my notes when you were talking, I don't remember, I think it was the first day, the very first day you were talking about looking for the cause that will evoke long-term change versus coping in the moment by using techniques to diminish the symptoms but they will come back. And I made myself a little paradigm \u2014 interestingly enough, in Hebrew words\u2014about the structure of freedom which I learned from my teacher.\nThe skeletal structure of the freedom myth as articulated in Exodus is first there is a problem and then there is a crying out. The problem was slavery, the people cried out to God. There was a response. God sent Moses \u2014 the instructor, the guide, the leader \u2014 and Aaron and Miriam in to the people who were having the problem. The problem got worse \u2014 more intense \u2014 and then they came out, but the coming out wasn't sufficient. They were out of the immediate situation \u2014 the slavery \u2014 but then they got up to the Red Sea with the Egyptian army behind them and the sea in front of them, so total block.\nSomething happened that shifted their cognitive possibility \u2014 that they were completely trapped and were going to be annihilated \u2014 and what happened, according to one of the rabbinical interpretations, is that somebody had the courage to go into the water and the going into the water made it split. And then they got through and the water closed over the army and they were free.\nBut they were not free yet because they were just a band of slaves who didn't know what to do with their freedom. So they wandered for a long time before they get to the goal which was the land. But in the meantime they would bump into a problem and say, \u2018What's the matter, why did you bring us out here? What, there weren't enough graves in Egypt? We could have died there just as well as going though all of this and then dying. And beside there we had fresh fish and there were leeks and there were cucumbers.'\nSo the negative circle\u2026 They were out, but what do they want? They long for the slavery. They want to go back\u2026\nSo I am putting what you are talking about with what my teacher taught me with what I got and I am going to have my gig!\n[Everyone is laughing\u2026]\nFollow up \u2014 By e-mail 11 days later:\nDavid,\nHope you are well.\nI continue to have important learnings from the work that I did with you and am getting very curious about what the recording will \"reveal\" to me when I listen to it.\nI'm off to Manchester tomorrow.\nRaphael\nFollow up \u2014 By e-mail 23 days later:\n...The recording arrived while I was in Manchester, and I have not yet had an opportunity to listen to it. I want to be able to give it my attention.\nI can tell you that I continue to experience my \"relationship\" with Hebrew differently. It is much easier to say 'I don't know' or 'that's interesting, I hadn't thought of that connection before' . . .\nDon't know if I'm going to Israel this summer or not. Plans are moving ahead so that we can go, but won't make a final decision until early May.\nThanks, again!\nRaphael\nFollow up \u2014 By e-mail 5 months later:\n...My experience of the Hebrew language has changed since our work together. Some of it is very subtle, but just like some of the natural healing arts, subtle is extremely profound. My understanding of the language, especially its grammatical structure, has deepened and things that used to perplex me no longer do so. I seem to have more vocabulary too, without really trying. The most profound change however remains my attitude. It has shifted from shame and embarrassment to curiosity and excitement when I make a connection or understand something that I didn't used to.\nIt was truly revelatory to learn that \"not knowing\" is simply \"not knowing\" and that teachers are supposed to teach. Sounds awfully simple, but it is revelatory nonetheless.\nLook forward to hearing from you!\nRaphael\nFollow up \u2014 By e-mail 15 months later:\n...My relationship to Hebrew has changed significantly in that I am more relaxed, its easier to say \"I don't know\" and to try to figure it out, I'm teaching/studying with some college seniors this year and it is delightful, they are teaching me as much as I am teaching them.\nAlso, I have decided that I really no longer care enough to dedicate the time and energy it would take to learn Hebrew at the level that I would want to actually have . . . so I'm going to pursue the study of massage therapy instead, much more fun, much more interesting. Don't know what I'll \"do\" with it, but who cares? It's enlivening to have something new and different to study.\nRaphael\nPostscript:\nSo, after that one session Raphael is not only free of being locked in the circle of shame and judgment, he is no longer stuck in the idea that he has to and should master Hebrew at a high level.\nIn fact, he is now free to explore the things he wants to do, not what he thought he should do.\n~~~~~~~/p>\nThere is a small biography of personal details about the author below.\nDownload this article for free in a new e-book format !\n"}, {"score": 1170.2925, "uuid": "7917e987-1f80-5b34-b391-d3942ccc0d9e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201wb-92-04053", "target_hostname": "www.flenj.org", "target_uri": "http://www.flenj.org/Publications/index.php?issue=53", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Foreign</em> <em>Language</em> Educators of New Jersey \u2014 What&#x27;s New", "snippet": "<em>Who</em> <em>is</em> looking <em>at</em> <em>or</em> listening to those programs and what has been the response so far?

Ms. Christopherson is a strong advocate for the arts and education, and is committed to the cause of bringing the world to New Jersey audiences.\nAL \u2013 On behalf of the 1,000 language educators who are members of Foreign Language Educators of New Jersey, I would like to thank you for taking the time to speak to us and share your views about world languages and international education.\nAL \u2013 NJN has partnerships with NPR, the BBC, and other public and private entities to help bring international perspectives to New Jersey audiences-BBC\u2019s The World for example. Has the interest in international affairs in New Jersey increased? Who is looking at or listening to those programs and what has been the response so far?\nEC \u2013 Public television attracts people who are interested in learning, people who are curious about the world. Our audience research data shows that our public is composed by people who care about their communities, who are most likely to get civically engaged, who want to hear the deeper story.\nNew Jersey is perhaps the most international state in the nation. You can walk into Jersey City schools and find children with hundreds of languages spoken from their backgrounds.\nOur state has residents from many countries. Some may even come from multilingual countries themselves. I recently visited India, a country where many languages are spoken. In New Jersey there is a large Indian population, which means that in turn many Indian languages can be heard in our state as well.\nGrowing up, my parents used to host Fulbright students from other parts of the world. That got me interested in languages, and I decided to study Mandarin Chinese in college. By growing up in New Jersey I was able to choose languages to learn in school, and today the variety of languages offered has increased to include Asian languages and other less commonly taught languages.\nThrough language we can also discover more about the culture of our own neighbors, the people populating the hospitals or the schools. We are a nation that was started by people from other countries that came here to create a greater state and a greater nation. I am an extremely strong supporter of world language educators and I hope that together we can encourage more Americans to learn not only English as well as they can, but also to explore other areas of the world and their cultures through languages.\nAL \u2013 \"Globalization\" is a hot word today. What needs to be done in New Jersey to create a new generation of responsible and fair global citizens? How can NJN help New Jersey youngest residents get ready?\nEC \u2013 There are many ways. We try to address audiences of different ages from the very young. As you can see, featured in our cover for this month is Global Grover. One of the reasons we decided to feature him on our cover is not so much to impress you because we knew you were coming, but because we are making programs to help teachers use multimedia to make learning exciting. Click here to read more about Global Grover\nNJN is also partnering with Kean University on a digital storytelling project. We are working on a \"Hello Song\" that will be available in many languages as well as on toolkits that teachers may use to collect students\u2019 stories about themselves and their families. These stories are to be shared with other communities in China, Thailand, England, S. America, Australia, India, Israel as well as other countries.\nIn addition, we are also working with Commissioner of Education Lucille Davy, who just announced the Partnership for the 21st Century Skills, which includes the recognition of the importance of learning foreign languages. Ms. Davy will come to talk to our Community Advisory Board, which consists of educators and others that advise NJN on all sorts of topics of interest to preschools, k-12, adults, teachers, and life-long learners.

Also, there are companies in New Jersey that have their headquarters here but have staff and facilities in other countries as well. These are examples of how international our audience already is, and we want to make sure that we are serving the interests of all.\nAL \u2013 The stereotype around the world is that Americans speak only English and study only American history in school. This is perceived as a symbol of great arrogance on the part of the richest country in the world. What steps do you think we need to take to change that perception?\nEC \u2013 I think that what the Department of Education\u2019s Partnership for the 21st century pursues is to help create more rigorous curricula based on higher expectations for our students. These curricula should provide students with the tools they will need to be successful in the new social and workplace environment. The skills contemplated are not only a high command of English, but also of technology, math, world languages, international education, civics, etc. We need to raise our expectations.\nGlobal Grover is aimed at young children. I believe that early childhood is a phenomenal time to start introducing children to the world. Young children are not afraid to try new things. They are eager to learn to pronounce words and are curious about the cultural differences they perceive. They can learn that children go to bed at different times and do different things during the day in different places. They will find it fascinating that people communicate differently. There are so many things that we can do if we start early! In a classroom in New Jersey today, a child may be sitting next to a child born in Korea and another whose parents are from Puerto Rico. They have different words for \"water.\" How interesting! And what a great way to learn about and start to appreciate the cultural values of others! I\u2019m a big proponent of early language learning.\nIn higher education, many colleges are starting to offer credits to study abroad in the hope that students develop at least the ability to begin a conversation in another language. I think this will be appreciated by everyone abroad.\nAL \u2013 In your opinion, how important is it for students pursuing careers in journalism to speak other languages? And in other fields?\nEC \u2013 I have a special regard for journalists, not only because they are so important to what we do here at NJN, but also because they fill a critical role in any democratic society. They identify key issues and give a voice to people. For these reasons, it is very important that they develop an awareness of the problems of our diverse community.\nNew Jersey is a global community, and we have reporters in other countries. We recently sent a reporter to Holland to relate the story of a girl that survived the Holocaust. The girl, Maud Dahme, is now a prominent resident of NJ who among other things has served as President of the New Jersey State Board of Education click here to read more about The Hidden Child story .\nWe send other journalists to other countries to report on stories that resonate with people here in NJ. We are already connected.\nAL \u2013 Communities in New Jersey are getting more diversified. How does NJN respond to this growing constituency? Does NJN offer educational programs that target speakers of other languages?\nEC \u2013 We are trying to do more to increase the diversity of our programs. Right now we offer some programming in Spanish, including some on literacy. We are also in talks with California to bring a bilingual program for young children to our audience. Right now it is being used in Los Angeles. Unfortunately we will have to offer it either in English or Spanish because we have only 24 hours of programming. However, it has been offered to us to take both and we are exploring how we could do that in the future.\nWe will soon implement a digital system, and this will allow us to do much more and multiply the choices. We will be able to access news from Japan or India or any other country because we will not be competing for those 24 hours of programming. We will be able to offer them simultaneously.\nAt NJN we are very interested in covering different perspectives and stories of universal nature, the human dilemmas that we all face and that provide a more balanced look of the world. We want to bring perspectives that are not only human, but that also provide insights to different cultures and moments in history.\nOne of the reasons an NJN team recently went to India is because we want to see how we can create more content based on different world perspectives. We met with three women leading one state in India, as governor, chief minister, and speaker, and I interviewed the governor. She is an elderly lady, and I asked her about the sacrifices that she had made in her life. She said that her father urged her as a young woman to go into public life. He told her that the family would take care of her kids, but that the children of India needed her more. These are human dilemmas that we all face, no matter were we live.\nAL \u2013 In New Jersey, a mandate was passed by the New Jersey Department of Education in 1996 to start world languages instruction in Kindergarten, however as of today implementation is very uneven due to a variety of factors. NJ is one of only a few states that has such a mandate and with the new interest in language education, it is in our childrens best interest to strengthen elementary language programs. How can NJN help?\nEC \u2013 We are happy to talk about our new capabilities with any group of educators or business people. One of the things that we offer for teachers is called Digital Classroom, which is a program that allows you to bring multimedia right to your computer from our towers. Through Digital Classroom you can access video libraries and you can also add your own content. It is a collaborative project, so if you add language content, people in other schools will be able to access it and benefit from it. Click here to learn more about NJNs Digital Classroom\nAL \u2013 There is a big gap between the perceived educational needs of the 21st century and the education that is actually taking place in schools. Because learning a language takes time and research shows that young children have a better capability to discern foreign sounds and patterns, many parents are taking the lead and enrolling their children in extra curricular language classes and playgroups. Bilingual families are also looking for ways to help their kids learn their home languages. NJN offers a great selection of early literacy programming-Reading Rockets-for example. What could be added to promote and advance literacy in two languages?\nEC \u2013 We had a partnership with ATT years ago when computers were fairly new to improve teaching conditions, and we have done things for reading coaches and many other groups. With the new digital technology we can develop many other programs, provided that we establish a funding and knowledge partnership. We are very interested in partnering and can send someone to talk to FLENJ or any other language group about creating multimedia language learning opportunities in NJ.\nAL \u2013 Do you think that public information networks such as NJN could lead the way in producing a new generation of well educated global citizens in New Jersey and nationally?\nEC \u2013 I think that we are already doing it. Our travel programs are very popular. They are not direct language instruction, but they create an interest that starts to build up.\nThis summer we will launch a new program called Travel with NJN. The idea is to invite members of our audience to travel around the world with journalist Burt Wolf, of the PBS series Travels & Traditions and What We Eat.

Our audience research data shows that our public is composed by people who care about their communities, who are most likely to get civically engaged, who want to hear the deeper story.\nNew Jersey is perhaps the most international state in the nation. You can walk into Jersey City schools and find children with hundreds of languages spoken from their backgrounds.\nOur state has residents from many countries. Some may even come from multilingual countries themselves. I recently visited India, a country where many languages are spoken. In New Jersey there is a large Indian population, which means that in turn many Indian languages can be heard in our state as well.\nGrowing up, my parents used to host Fulbright students from other parts of the world.

And learning it with an experienced native teacher makes it a lot easier and enjoyable!\nFor children 12 and under we offer both group and private Spanish lessons: it's your choice! When placed in a group, your son or daughter will only have classmates of a similar age and Spanish level (maximum 6 students per class but the average is around 3 to 4).

During other times of the year, the group option is only offered when siblings can be placed together with the same Spanish teacher or when other children of a similar age and level are joining us for the same dates. Feel free to contact us about group enquiries for your child .\nFor more information about our Spanish Classes for Children, please click here...\nSpanish Classes for your Teens\nFor teens from 13 to 17 years of age we also offer Spanish language lessons, either privately or in a small group of no more than 6 students per class.\nIf your teenager would like to have group lessons, this can be arranged during Panama's high season (January, February and March) or during summer holidays (June, July or August). Your son or daughter's classmates will be of a similar age and Spanish level to him or her. Teens that are 16 and 17 years of age can also be placed in a group with young adults if they are mature enough.\nMany families also ask for a Total Spanish Immersion for their teen and have them placed with a local host family , while parents and younger siblings stay at one of our other lodging options .\nFor more information about our Spanish lessons for teens please click here...\nSpanish Lessons for Mom & Dad\nAt Habla Ya Spanish Schools we firmly believe that every student should choose the Spanish Course that best meets their own personal needs. We offer the following courses for adults:\nGroup 4 Spanish Course : comprised of 20 hours of lessons per week in a small group of no more than 6 students. Groups are arranged according to students' Spanish levels ensuring that classmates will have a very similar degree of communicative proficiency.\nOne to One Private Spanish Classes : 2 to 6 hours of private Spanish lessons per day. The contents and schedule of these private Spanish lessons are arranged to suit each student's individual needs.\nGroup 4 PLUS Course : Group 4 PLUS adds 1 or 2 extra hours of private lessons on top of the standard 4 hours of group classes that students would normally have each day in our Group 4 Course.\nDELE Exam Preparation Course : DELE is the Official Test for Spanish as a foreign language. At our school, candidates are prepared by having 20 - 30 hours of private Spanish lessons per week.\nPersonalized Spanish Courses : sometimes students require a specialized Spanish Course and need to focus on a topic of a particularly specific nature. It could be an Intensive Spanish Course , a Medical Spanish Course , Business Spanish, Spanish for construction or Legal Spanish , or simply vocabulary or a Spanish language skill related to a specific field. On the other hand there are couples that wish to have a Spanish teacher just for themselves and in this case we offer them mini-group lessons .\nThe cost for Spanish lessons in Bocas del Toro and Boquete, Panama goes from $135 to $345 per person per week (it costs the same at both of our Spanish schools). It all depends on the type of Spanish classes you decide to have (group lessons, mini-group lessons or private lessons) and on the amount of hours of lessons each of you decide to have each week (10 to 30 hours).\n"}], [{"score": 1154.1632, "uuid": "28a82552-c3bd-5aca-99fd-774e8348d3f6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401tw-03-20802", "target_hostname": "www.scoop.it", "target_uri": "http://www.scoop.it/t/learning-technology/p/1327105936/early-language-learning-in-europe?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Early <em>Language</em> <em>Learning</em> in Europe | <em>Learning</em> Technology | Scoop.it", "snippet": "Join Now The ELLiE study provides <em>a</em> detailed insight of the policy and implementation processes for early <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> <em>learning</em> programmes in Europe, giving <em>a</em> rich description of learner experiences and contexts for <em>learning</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Early Language Learning in Europe\nThe ELLiE study provides a detailed insight of the policy and implementation processes for early foreign language learning programmes in Europe, giving a rich description of learner experiences and contexts for learning.

Read More\nBy GreatSchools Staff\nA parent's attitude toward language learning is crucial to a child's success, say language teachers and researchers. And parents don't always recognize the value of learning a second language in a changing world, says Marty Abbott, director of education for the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. \"Adult Americans are, for the most part, monolingual. They say, 'Well, I've been successful.'\"\nWhy learn a language? It's likely to help your child become a better thinker, as well as giving her an advantage in the work world.\nHere's what you can do to support language classes at your child's school and language learning at home:\n- Help your child make time to practice. Learning a language is like learning to play an instrument, says Paula Patrick, foreign-language coordinator for the Fairfax County, Virginia, public schools. There needs to be time to practice.\n- Have your student teach you to say something in the language every day. Explaining is learning. Let your child laugh at your mangled pronunciation \u2014 and correct you.\n- Find cultural events connected to the language and culture being studied. \"I'm big on kids developing a personal connection with the language, because at some point, they'll hit a teacher they don't connect with,\" says Michael Bacon, who coordinates the nationally recognized language-immersion programs for public schools in Portland, Oregon. This can be tough in communities without many immigrants or for families whose children are studying less commonly used languages like Arabic or Mandarin. But it can often be done with some creative thinking. Bacon says Portland students in a Japanese class acted as translators for a child from Japan who was admitted to a local hospital. Or check to see if your city has a sister city program or your local business community has ties abroad that can connect students to native speakers.\n- Ask the teacher for resources your child can use at home. The Internet offers a wealth of language resources unimaginable even a few years ago. \"Challenge that teacher to think outside the box,\" says Tom Welch, a former French teacher, Kentucky Teacher of the Year and principal, and currently an education consultant. \"If the teacher's not responsive, say to your child, 'Let's get online together and find out what we can discover that can help you.'\"\n- Provide videos, books and music in the language. \"You can even use these in beginning language class,\" Patrick says. \"You can get meaning even if you don't get every word.\" Ask the teacher for suggestions before you buy to make sure the resources are geared toward a young learner rather than an adult business traveler.\n- Look for opportunities outside the classroom. Summer language camps are one resource. The 50-year-old Concordia Languages Villages offer camps for kids from 7-18 in 14 languages in Minnesota. Study-abroad opportunities are great for high school students. Families of students of all ages can consider hosting a foreign-exchange student. Talk to parents, teachers and administrators about bringing native speakers from the school staff and larger community to talk to students in the language class. Have an international night and invite the community.\n- Volunteer to organize a career day that features jobs that use skills in more than one language. Think there aren't many? Take a look at the Monterey Language Institute's list of careers , which includes a list of business jobs gleaned from a search of the top job-search websites.\n- Be an advocate. Having a great program in elementary school doesn't guarantee that classes will be available in middle or high school to increase your child's skills. Ask about your district's plans to provide continuous language-learning opportunities for students at all grade levels, and learn how you can help. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages offers tips for parents who want to advocate for language programs in their communities.\n"}, {"score": 1150.7604, "uuid": "dc1b26d4-1ebd-500e-88cf-148efb8583b4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-96-22233", "target_hostname": "www.languagedoor.com", "target_uri": "http://www.languagedoor.com/san_fernando_valley_language_school/adults/program_adults.html", "page_rank": 1.5102026e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>at</em> our San", "snippet": "The idea of <em>a</em> person <em>who</em> learns <em>a</em> <em>foreign</em> <em>language</em> fluently in almost no time with no effort <em>is</em> largely <em>a</em> myth.

All instructors are native speakers or speak with native-level proficiency. They are carefully selected for communicative skills, talent, and enthusiasm to share their language.\nOur Program and Approach\nAdults generally learn language better when they can use their understanding of their native language and logic and reasoning capabilities to greatly aid the process of leaning an additional language. Most adults are practical learners, learning based on usability and objectives rather than based on theories or purely academic pursuits. They tend to show the most progress when presented with a practical combination of reading, writing, listening and speaking, a practical mix of English and the language being learned and a focus on useful aspects of the language that they can use from the very start.\nAdditionally, language learning is much more effective in small groups.\u00a0 It is extremely important when learning a language that the student speak and receive appropriate guidance. For this reason, it's not practical for one language instructor to effectively help a class of thirty students.\nUsing our approach, adults learn language quickly through interaction in small-group classes.\nLearning a Foreign Language - It's Not Easy, or Is It?\nWhether \"learning\" a foreign language is easy or not depends on your objectives. Ordering food in a restaurant and handling basic introductions can be learned without too much difficulty. Achieving true fluency requires substantially more time.\nThe idea of a person who learns a foreign language fluently in almost no time with no effort is largely a myth. It generally takes time and practice, but the process can be a fun and rewarding experience.\nLearning a Language can be Fun\nWe offer the opportunity to learn 36 different languages at our Language Door School in the San Fernando Valley in Encino. Our comfortable, casual environment helps to make learning the language of your choice fun and convenient. We schedule our classes at times that work for busy adults. Enrich your life as you learn one language or learn many.\nSchools of Thought\nThere are many schools of thought on how best to learn a foreign language. Many of these schools claim they have found the \"best\" way to learn. We feel that the best way to learn depends on the person. Some people learn better orally, some visually. Some learn best when they want to, others when they have to. Some prefer rules and structure, others practice and application. Nobody can tell you what works best, but teachers, books, and experience can help show you the way.\nFurthermore, we also believe that a foreign language can best be learned through a combination of instruction, study, and practice. Any one of these in isolation, while still be helpful, will generally be less effective and rewarding.\nFor instance, consider the benefit of having a lesson each week and doing nothing else, compared to having the same lesson each week but learning the vocabulary beforehand, or reinforcing what you learned after the lesson through actual use in conversation.\nVocabulary\nSome people benefit from learning vocabulary lists, while for others the effort exceeds the rewards. Regardless, vocabulary forms the building blocks of language. Whether by studying lists or learning though usage, you'll want to develop some vocabulary.\nThe amount of words in a language can be staggering (from twenty thousand to more than one hundred thousand depending on the language and how the words are counted). However, one hundred words can be sufficient for basic conversation, and a couple thousand for fairly normal conversation.\nIf you want to improve your vocabulary retention, consider trying word associations. The association can be either logical or illogical, whichever works best for you.\nFor instance, the Spanish word el coche can logically be associated with coach (like a carriage) which was the predecessor to the car. It may help to imagine your car as a coach, or imagine horses pulling it. The illogical approach might say el coche sounds like coach (such as a basketball coach), and try to link coach and car in the most vivid way possible. For instance, imagine your basketball coach lifting your car above his or her head, then throwing it at a basketball hoop or through a wall. You can remember that el coche is masculine in Spanish by adding to the image - in the first example, imagine male horses pulling your car, or in the second example, use a male coach.\nThe time it takes to create these associations can pay dividends later on through easier retention. As you practice, you'll get quicker and create better associations.\nGrammar\nPeople often point out that kids learn language easily, and kids don't study grammar. Kids do learn easily in some respects (i.e., accent), but consider the amount of time they spend playing with friends, watching cartoons, or with other activities in that language. Many experts feel adults prefer to think logically, and learn better based on structure and rules such as grammar.\nComprehension\nComprehension improves with practice, whether through lessons, reading, or conversation.\nThe recent growth of DVD's provides a great tool to improve comprehension. The language options vary by movie, but many have audio and/or subtitle options in major languages. For instance if learning French, try watching a movie first in French audio with English subtitles, then French audio with French subtitles, then French audio with no subtitles. For better results, watch the movie with a dictionary nearby, and when you hear or see a word you still don't understand, look it up! The audio track and subtitles do not always match, but they are usually close enough to provide a very effective learning tool.\nSummary\nWe feel there's no \"secret\" to learning a foreign language. We recommend you learn based on what works best for you. Discuss different methods and tools with us or with your teacher. If possible, use a combination of instruction, study, and practice. Best of luck in this fun and rewarding experience!\n"}]]}
