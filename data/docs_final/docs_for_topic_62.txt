First start your plants in small pots and place them onto a tray or saucer to catch any excess water. Once your plants and their roots are well established you can then re-pot them into a much bigger pot to provide you with a better yield and finish them off to full maturity and harvest.\nSquare Plant Pots\nWe stock square plastic plant pots that range from 0.7 litre right up to 18 litre. Small square pots should always be used first to establish your seedlings or cuttings and when the plant and roots are becoming pot bound they should then be transplanted into a larger size pot. The bigger the pot the better the yield.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a30.30\nRound Plant Pots\nWe stock round plastic plant pots that range from 7.5 litre right up to 30 litre pots with handles for people who want to grow very large plants. Our round pots all have good drainage holes and will need to be placed onto a plant pot saucer or tray to catch any excess solution when you are watering your plants.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a31.70\nRoot Pruning Pots\nRoot pruning pots encourage the internal root structure of your plants to develop a lot more than normal pots. As the roots become visible from the slits they are air pruned, which makes your plants root structure grow more internally, enabling your plants to uptake more nutrients that are applied to produce a better yield.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a31.00\nRoot Pouch Fabric Pots\nRoot Pouch are fabric degradable pots that can be washed and reused in your garden for several years. These fabric pots allow more air to circulate in and around the root zone of your plants, allowing them to breath far easier than being contained in a regular plastic pot with no air holes in the sides.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a30.75\nPlant Pot Saucers\nOur round plant pot saucers are great for those who only grow a few plants indoors or outdoors and do not need a big tray for the job. These plant pot saucers are available in three sizes, 24cm, 32cm and 37cm and they also have a 4cm wall to collect any excess solution when you are watering your plants.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a31.00\nGarland Trays\nWe stock several Garland trays in square and rectangle shapes to suit various different available spaces. These trays are moulded with a thick strong black plastic and are great to use indoors in a grow room or tent for your pots to be placed on to, to catch excess solution when you are watering your plants.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a36.50\nWater Tanks\nWater is essential for an indoor garden and it will need storing ready for those thirsty plants. These water tanks will do the job nicely and can be placed neatly in a corner of a room, filled and ready. These tanks can also be used for the enthusiast who wishes to build their very own DIY hydroponic growing system.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a310.00\nWater Butts & Stands\nThese water butts are great for anyone who needs to store a lot of water but doesnt have very much room to do so, as they can be positioned in a corner and will take up very little space. Our water butts come with a tap and a lid and stands are also available for the 100 litre and 250 litre water butt.\nFrom:\u00a0\u00a330.00\nAquatrays\nAquatrays are used for growing in either Canna coco slabs or Grodan Rockwool slabs.

Multiple sacrifice branches are encouraged in order to thicken the trunk. This period of allowing growth and then cutting it back is continued until the desired trunk size, taper, and movement are achieved.\nLater, once the growers\u2019 goals are met concerning the trunk, taper, and movement, the plant is transferred to a training pot to define the nebari and create finer \u201cfeeder\u201d roots while accustoming the plant to a container. During this period ramification and final branch placement are also begun. Finally, the plant is transferred into bonsai pot where it will spend the remainder of its lifetime.\nGrow boxes are also used to place freshly collected stock into in order for the plant to recover and become accustomed to life out of the ground while waiting for it to become strong enough to begin training. The grow box is used instead of a training pot to accompany the larger root mass in need of fine feeder roots which is typical of collected trees.\nAlthough grow boxes and training pots are often considered as the same thing, they serve two completely different purposes. In the following article I will separate the two and explain in detail the uses of both.\nGrow Boxes\nGrowing or grow boxes can be defined as any container that will allow free, almost unrestricted growth of a plant in order to increase the size of the trunk, root mass, branch numbers, and/or height of the tree.\nPhotograph by Vance Wood\nGrow boxes are typically slightly oversized pots or boxes used for the expressed purpose of obtaining faster growth, trunk and root development than would be unobtainable in a regular bonsai pot. Although, for simplicity and clarity, I have used the term \u201cgrow boxes\u201d in this article, the term is used here to encompass all oversized containers that can be used for the purposes outlined.\nThese containers come in as many shapes and forms as there are bonsaists. The typical wooden box is most likely the most efficient and attractive, but I have seen dish washing pans, dresser drawers, small tires, large nursery pots, large bonsai pots, azalea pots, cooking pans, produce boxes, and Tupperware containers used for this purpose. The common denominator is using a container that will allow good drainage, root ramification, and that is reasonably affordable. Not to mention bringing growing conditions as close to actual ground growing as possible.\nGrowing in the ground will achieve these results quicker yet some people do not have the space to maintain a growing bed so grow boxes are a substitute and are the next best thing.\nA common misconception is that the larger the container, the faster and better the growth, this is a myth and actually could be more detrimental in the long run due to the fact that the massive amount of excess soil surrounding the root ball may never get the chance to dry out. A grow box should be only a few inches wider at most than the root mass of the plant being put into it. Once the roots colonize the new soil, if more growth is required, the plant can be slipped potted into a larger container without distributing the roots or, if the desired results have been obtained, it can be moved into a training pot.\nWith collected trees this also holds true. As the roots are usually damaged slightly and feeder roots are low in numbers, it is important not to place them in a overly large soil mass. A grow box that is a few inches bigger than the root mass is all that is needed. In most cases the root mass will be worked down in size anyhow in the future so the goal should be to create feeder roots, not encourage a bigger root mass. Since collected trees usually take awhile before fully participating in the transfer of water out of the soil, having to big of a pot and thereby, too much soil, can lead to an overly wet environment.\nIf you think about how nurseries grow stock in pots this will make more sense. They start out seedlings in very small pots and then once the roots fill the container, they move it up into the next size pot and then once the roots have filled this, they move it one size up again. They do not simply place a seedling into a ten gallon pot and wait. Considering that nurseries make their profit selling plants and that they can sell bigger stock for more money than small stock, you must admit that they have to get stock to grow as quickly as humanly possible. There practice of up-potting then must be the most efficient and quickest way to develop stock.\nI know that the common response to this practice is the question that if plants grow the best in the ground, wouldn\u2019t it best to try and duplicate that environment in a super sized pot with lots of excess soil. The answer is no because pots are just not like the ground, the drainage and water retention are not the same. For further reading on this subject I would recommend two of Brent Walstons\u2019 excellent articles, \u201c Overpotting \u201d and \u201c Why the Earth Is Not Like a Pot \u201c. For more information on Brent Walston, who is certainly the leading authority on growing and developing stock for bonsai in the United States, you can see an in-depth interview at artofbonsai.org\nAs mentioned above, almost any container will work as a grow box as long as it is not too large, typically 2 to 3 inches of new soil around the root mass is plenty, any more and you risk the overall health of the tree.\nI personally prefer using wooden boxes as shown above for this purpose as they are shallow, easily built to size from inexpensive materials, lightweight, and relatively attractive. Being shallow, they help to create the nebari we desire in bonsai. The wood for grow boxes can be purchased if necessary or as I do, you can recycle wood from projects, pallets or old produce crates. I recently built a deck around my pool using plastic lumber which saws, nails, and screws just like wood, but will never rot. The scraps from the deck have given me material for many grow boxes.\nMaking a grow box is a simple matter as illustrated here. I leave spaces between the bottom boards for drainage. Any type of screen that is bigger than window screen and will not rust can be used over the slats to prevent your soil mix from falling through. I personally use self adhesive drywall mesh for this purpose and it comes in a roll, can be easily cut to size, will not decompose, and it inexpensive.\nIllustration by Will Heath\nYou can get as fancy as you wish; one club member cuts his end pieces taller and cuts ovals for handles on the top. I have seen the edges mitered, the upper lip routed, the outside of the box stained, and metal straps wrapped around the sides for strength, only your imagination and skill set the limits.\nWhatever your material or design, keep a few boxes of varying sizes handy and material to create a custom sized box when the need arises. Spaces for drainage can vary and different board widths can be used on the bottom as the only object is to assure good drainage and enough strength to withstand moving or rotating the box from time to time.\nTraining Pots\nOnce the trunk thickness, nebari, and branching have been achieved in a grow box, it is time to more the tree into a training pot so that it can develop the fine root system it will need to survive life in a bonsai pot. Ramification and finer development can also be started while the tree is in a training pot.\nPhotograph by Vance Wood\nSometimes the development of the trunk and nebari in collected stock and nursery stock is already at an advanced state and the grow box step can be skipped altogether so that the tree can be placed directly into a training pot.\nFiner root development can be obtained by using a pot with screened sides and bottom. These are available made exclusively for this purpose or you could also use pond baskets, which are not as attractive but work in basically the same way and are available at low prices at most pond stores and box stores in the pond department.\nPhotograph by Vance Wood\nThe first two pictures show screen sided redwood training pots. This design is so unique that Vance Wood was awarded a patent for it some years ago. Screen sided pots help in root development and they effectively prevent the circling of roots common in all other types of pots. The design combines excellent drainage with automated pruning of roots. The root tips that reach the light through the screen stop growing, which allows resources to be redirected to other roots deeper within the soil and closer to the trunk, creating excellent ramification of the roots and creating a mass of fine feeder roots. I have had excellent results with screen sided pots.\nAnother nice feature of Vance\u2019s pots is that the bottom is not fastened in and can be pushed upwards which makes removing the root mass a breeze.\nVance\u2019s Redwood pots are very attractive they look great around the yard and both his pots and pond baskets work better than any other training pots I have used. The fine root systems that result from the use of screen sided training pots has convinced me never to use anything else.\nPhotograph by Vance Wood\nThe Third picture is of a pond basket, sold at most garden centers to be used for plants growing in ponds or for filtering. These come in various sizes and are quite inexpensive; the 2-gallon size shown was purchased for under a dollar.\nPond baskets have all the advantages of the redwood pot except the appearance. They can be buried for winter if needed and like the wooden framed pot, has excellent drainage all around. These are quickly becoming very popular with bonsai enthusiasts everywhere.\nI wire two long and narrow blocks to the bottom to act as feet so that air can circulate underneath the pot and so water can drain out of the screened bottom better. By wiring the blocks to the bottom they remain attached when I rotate or move the pot. The addition of feet are not necessary with Vance Wood\u2019s planters shown above, as the bottom screen is already designed to be off of the surface of the bench.\nMany people use basic garden center plastic liners, larger bonsai pots and such for training pots however, these do little for fine root development and are not usually recommended.\nI hope that I have successfully explained the differences between a grow box and a training pot as well as clearly explained the uses and advantages of both. Happy growing.\n"}, {"score": 1520.1116, "uuid": "1cf0bd49-68d7-56ed-8bda-15dbd883f111", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1216wb-35-02624", "target_hostname": "www.stratfordpress.co.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.stratfordpress.co.nz/news/pots-deserve-a-refresher/1180762/", "page_rank": 1.1737509e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Gardening: <em>Pots</em> deserve a refresher | Taranaki Lifestyle News | <em>Health</em>,", "snippet": "New terracotta <em>is</em> fine - it will soon look as old as the hills - and glossy <em>ceramic</em> planters are gorgeous for modern courtyards and terraces.

They've grown thin and leggy and don't look like flowering any time soon.\nIn the carport were two square concrete pots hosting a couple of straggly pink daisies, on the terrace a lovely aqua Morris and James ceramic olive pot with a bedraggled red banana palm in it, and alongside the carport three tall concrete pots with yuccas in them.\nThe yuccas look extraordinarily happy but the pots do not.\nIt was a rare day in the Far North - the first in a good three weeks it didn't rain at least once, sunny for the best part, and warm enough to make you think a glass of cool sauvignon might be a treat after the toil of the day.\nDealing with the containers seemed like the perfect job, since the soil was far too wet to put your hands in.\nBecause I have a very short attention span, and instant gratification is essential, within an eight-hour timespan I have to empty the containers, clean or paint them, replant them and reposition them.\nAnd because I'm a change bunny, they can't simply be reconstituted as they were - the pots need a new identity, there must be fresh, vibrant, healthy plants, and they need to be placed somewhere completely different to give a new aspect to the garden.\nIt's quite a lot of work, but the upside is that freshly cleaned, painted or new containers give the garden a great lift in the middle of winter, and make it all look as if somebody terribly stylish really cares about it.\nI'd counsel against painting terracotta containers a solid colour because they tend to come out looking a bit cheap and plastic-like, but you can paint them flat white, or another flat colour which can then be sanded back to reveal touches of the original material.\nNew terracotta is fine - it will soon look as old as the hills - and glossy ceramic planters are gorgeous for modern courtyards and terraces.\nGetting your containers sorted is the easy part - figuring out what to plant in them is more of a challenge. Since it's winter, something that will look either lush or colourful, or both, is ideal.\nYou may be tempted by those \"potted colour\" stands in the garden centre, but you could also consider something a bit more permanent and which could be transplanted into the garden at a later date.\nThe Asplenium bulbiferum fern is beautiful as well as very useful and makes a striking cover plant for shady situations.\nIts lush, lacy foliage looks quite tropical and it loves the shade. It's a gorgeous container plant with fronds weeping gracefully over the edge of a pot. Just don't let it dry out.\nI'm having a love affair with camellias at the moment and have discovered that hybrids based on the small-leaf species, which have masses of little flowers, can be used as container plants.\nI'm trying the utterly gorgeous Nicky Crisp in a container in a half-shaded corner of the courtyard.\nTo keep these winter flowering container plants healthy, feed them regularly with a foliar or liquid fertiliser.\nI have to admit that the most colourful plants in my garden right now are tangelos, mandarins and limes, reminding me that citrus looks brilliant in containers.\nLots of varieties are now available as dwarfs, so you can fill an outdoor living space with their colour and scent.\nThey need quite large containers and look especially good in half wine barrels if you can lay your hands on some.\nTips\nIf you're going to be looking down into your freshly planted container, chances are you'll see a lot of soil. Not such a good look. To give new plants a bedded-in look, cover the soil with mulch. If you don't want to use bark, there are many other choices available, from crushed shell to coloured pebbles to flat stones to tumbled glass. If your container is wide-mouthed, there may be room to plant smaller plants beneath the main event, or add decorative rocks, pieces of driftwood or ornaments.\nSpecial Offers\n"}, {"score": 1454.1298, "uuid": "0e99e1dc-b5e2-5d79-a421-4999a093ae15", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-18-20182", "target_hostname": "tipnut.com", "target_uri": "http://tipnut.com/garden-irrigation/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Buried Clay <em>Pot</em> Irrigation For The Garden {&amp; More} : TipNut.com", "snippet": "If there are no fitted lids for the jars, you can use flat rocks, shells <em>or</em> <em>ceramic</em> tiles depending on the size <em>of</em> the hole.

It\u2019s a new concept to me but this method has apparently been around for centuries yet still offers value to today\u2019s gardener. Here\u2019s a bunch of info to get you started and then I added several different DIY irrigation methods at the bottom (some simple and small enough for house plants while others are more suited for gardens and shrubbery). Enjoy!\nUse Pots That Are Unglazed For This Project\nHere\u2019s the scoop: The idea is to bury clay pots (Ollas) in the ground making sure to keep the mouth level with (or just above) the soil surface and then fill them with water.\nAs the soil dries, suction develops and the water slowly seeps out from inside the pot and into the soil around it (the suction force is created by soil moisture tension and/or plant roots themselves, source ). This is a naturally automatic system, if it\u2019s been raining, the soil is wet so there is no moisture tension and the pots don\u2019t release any water. The soil gets just what it needs, right when it needs it with no gadgets or sensors required!\nArrange the pots in clusters and plant your garden around them. How many do you need? Each pot will water the plants within its immediate area (responding to the soil moisture tension around it). The larger the pot you use, the larger the area it covers (and the less often you have to top it up with water).\nSince the pots are buried, water is delivered more efficiently at root level rather than above the soil surface (with water needing to travel a few inches down to reach the roots). To keep the system working optimally, add more water to the pots as needed and avoid letting them dry out completely. Dig the pots up at the end of the growing season to prevent breakage over cold winter months. This method can be used in container gardening as well, you\u2019ll just need to use smaller clay pots that will fit inside the containers or planter boxes leaving enough room for the plants to thrive.\nWhat kind of pots to use: They need to be unglazed clay pots (otherwise the water will be sealed inside and won\u2019t seep out) and can have a wide or narrow mouth. Select pots that don\u2019t have a long or fragile neck so they\u2019ll withstand being buried without breaking. You can use regular flower pots but make sure to seal closed the drainage hole. Keep the mouth of the jar covered to prevent insects and debris from getting inside and to help reduce water loss through evaporation. If there are no fitted lids for the jars, you can use flat rocks, shells or ceramic tiles depending on the size of the hole.\nA clay pot in operation when installed neck-deep into the ground and filled with water.

If it does, it\u2019s porous enough.\nBonus: Because the soil is kept moist inches below the soil surface, this helps reduce the growth of weeds (also means less water consumption and less maintenance).\nResources\nBuried Pot Surrounded By Plants From ecocomposite.org\nHere are some reference pages with more details (also make sure to grab the 25 page pdf linked to in the diagram image above)\u2026\necocomposite.org : Provides a bit of history to this technique and traces it back to over 2,000 years ago (from China).

Gardeners talking the back-fence talk of gardeners everywhere, except that these gardeners happened to be criminals.\nSunday afternoon\u2019s panel discussion had just adjourned, and gardeners were milling in small knots among the potted marijuana plants that dotted the room like ficus trees in a hotel lobby.

Now trading impressions gleaned from a joint the size of a small cigar, the two gardeners fell headlong into an arcane discussion of light levels and cellular cloning, proper curing technique and the relative merits of Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica. I think of myself as fairly knowledgeable gardener, but I was lost.\nThe occasion was the Cannabis Cup, a convention, harvest festival and industry trade show sponsored by High Times magazine and held each year over Thanksgiving weekend in Amsterdam, where the cultivation and possession of small amounts of marijuana, while technically illegal, are tolerated. On the first floor of the Pax Party House, a catering hall and meeting center in a residential section of the city, panels convened each afternoon to discuss the latest trends in marijuana horticulture and review developments in the hemp fiber industry. Upstairs in the exposition hall, hundreds of convention-goers strolled past booths displaying high-tech gardening equipment, marijuana seed catalogues and wholesale lines of hemp clothing, hemp foods and hemp cosmetics. Multiply the number of booths, pump in large quantities of marijuana smoke and the scene might have been the Jacob Javits Center, thronged with pushy exhibitors rehearsing their pitches, handing out samples, writing up orders. Things got very mellow in the evenings, however, when the delegates assembled in the main hall for comparison tastings of new hybrid strains, ultimately casting their votes for the world\u2019s best marijuana. Seeds of the winning cultivars would be smuggled home with the gardeners, to be planted as part of next season\u2019s crop.\nI had come to Amsterdam to meet some of these gardeners and learn how, in little more than a decade, marijuana growing in America had evolved from a hobby of aging hippies into a burgeoning high-tech industry with earnings that are estimated at $32 billion a year. That makes it easily the nation\u2019s biggest cash crop. Unlike corn ($14 billion) or soybeans ($11 billion), however, modern marijuana farming depends less on soil and sunlight than technology, allowing it to thrive not only in the fields of the farm belt but in downtown apartments and lofts, in suburban basements and attics, even in closets.\nFewer than 20 years ago, virtually all the marijuana consumed in America was imported. \u201cHome grown\u201d was a term of opprobrium\u2014\u201dsomething you only smoked in an emergency,\u201d as one grower old enough to remember put it. Today, thanks in no small part to the efforts of the people assembled in this hall\u2014as well as to the Federal war on drugs, which gave the domestic industry a leg up by protecting it from foreign imports and providing a spur to innovation\u2014American marijuana cultivation has developed to the point where the potency, quality and consistency of the domestic product are considered as good as, if not better than, any in the world.\nIn an era of global competition, the rise of a made-in-America marijuana industry is one of the more striking\u2014if perhaps least welcome\u2014economic success stories of the 1980\u2032s and 90\u2032s. Domestic growers now dominate the high end of a market consisting of at least 12 million occasional users; on Wall Street, in Hollywood, on colleges campuses, consumers pay $300 to $500 an ounce for the re-engineered home-grown product, and even more for the \u201cconnoisseur\u201d\u2018 varieties grown by the kind of small, sophisticated growers on hand for the Cannabis Cup. Peering through the haze at the conventioneers milling in the Pax Party House, Brian R. declared in a tone of deep reverence, \u201cThere are a lot of true pioneers in this room.\u201d\nHome Grown Grows Up\nA bit of historical perspective, by way of a confession: Not only did your correspondent once inhale but, like a great many other gardeners (and nongardeners) of my generation, I also once grew. It was more than a decade ago, and in a very different time. Only a few years before, in 1977, President Carter had endorsed decriminalization of marijuana and even the Drug Enforcement Administration was entertaining the idea; 10 states, including New York, had already taken that step, though mine\u2014Connecticut\u2014was not one of them.\nMy own experience growing pot was a fiasco. In my backyard, I\u2019d planted a couple of seedlings sprouted from some \u201cMaui Zowie\u201d given to me by my sister\u2019s boyfriend. Within months, my avid weeds had ballooned to the size of small trees, rendering them uncomfortably conspicuous. The plants continued to grow at an alarming rate right into fall, though for some reason they refused to flower. This didn\u2019t greatly trouble me, however, since in those days people still smoked marijuana leaves. (When I mentioned this quaint practice to Brian, he roared with laughter. Nowadays, only sinsemilla\u2014the seedless bud of a female plant\u2014is considered worth smoking; all the rest, called \u201cshake,\u201d is usually thrown out.)\nMy days as a marijuana farmer ended abruptly one October morning, when a fellow delivering a cord of firewood happened to let drop that he was the police chief of a neighboring town\u2014this while standing in my driveway, a single well-aimed glance away from my 12-foot marijuana plants. I managed just barely to steer him off the property before he spotted them. Immediately thereafter, I harvested my first and last crop: a couple of pounds of leaves that I literally could not give away.\nWhat had been a mildly humorous close call in 1980 (for all my paranoia, I risked little more than a fine and some embarrassment) would be distinctly unamusing in 1995. Today, the penalty for the cultivation of a kilo\u20142.2 pounds\u2014or more of marijuana in the state of Connecticut is a five-year mandatory minimum sentence. Like most states, Connecticut rewrote its drug laws during the late 1980\u2032s to impose heavy new penalties for marijuana crimes, but Connecticut\u2019s are by no means the harshest: in Oklahoma, cultivating any amount of marijuana can result in a life sentence. And jail time is not the only penalty I would face were the police chief to find a couple of pot plants on my property today. Regardless of whether or not I was ultimately convicted of any crime, his department could seize my house and land and use the proceeds in any way it saw fit: a new cruiser, a pay raise, whatever.\nThis is America in the time of the drug war. A relatively little-known aspect of that war is that many Federal and state laws have been rewritten to erase the distinction between marijuana and hard drugs like heroin and cocaine, on the Reagan-era theory that the best approach to the drug problem is \u201czero tolerance.\u201d Today, the Federal penalties for possession of a hundred marijuana plants and a hundred grams of heroin are identical: a mandatory 5- to 40-year sentence, without chance of parole. An American convicted of murder can expect to spend, on average, less than nine years behind bars.\nMany Americans, perhaps recalling the legal and cultural climate of the 70\u2032s, wrongly assume that marijuana has not been an important front in the drug war. Yet under the crime bill passed last summer, the cultivation of 60,000 marijuana plants is an offense punishable by death. Nowadays, marijuana is seldom grown on that scale; pot farming is by and large a cottage industry in which a thousand plants would be considered a big \u201cgrow.\u201d Even so, there are more than 30 people in the country serving life sentences for the crime of growing marijuana.\nWith so much more at stake, the techniques of growing marijuana, as well as the genetics of the marijuana plant itself, have been revolutionized in the last 10 to 15 years\u2014as one glance at the potted marijuana plants on display in the convention hall made plain. Apart from the familiar leaf pattern, these plants looked nothing like the plants I had grown. They looked more like marijuana bonsai\u2014no larger than a patio tomato plant and yet fully mature, their stems bending under the weight of buds thick as fists.\nWhile I was examining these specimens, wondering how the feat of miniaturization had been achieved, Brian drifted over to chat. He explained that plants such as these were in all likelihood clones of a modern hybrid strain that had been grown indoors in a completely artificial environment. By manipulating the amount, intensity and even the wavelength of the light the plant received, the carbon dioxide content of the air it breathed and the nutrients supplied to its roots, a skillful gardener can foreshorten the life cycle of a marijuana plant to the point where it will produce a heavy crop of flowers in less than two months on a plant no bigger than a table lamp.\nSeveral dozen such plants can be grown in a square yard, Brian told me. His own current garden in Holland contained 100 plants in an area slightly more than six feet square\u2014smaller than a pool table. This sort of densely planted indoor table-top garden is known among growers as the \u201cSea of Green\u201d and it represents more or less the state of the art in marijuana horticulture. I asked Brian if I could pay a visit to his garden. He put me off\u2014growing commercially is dangerous even here. But I could see he was tempted; most gardeners are showoffs at heart. \u201cLet me talk to my roommate.\u201d\nTo the Sea of Green\nWithout a doubt, one of the pioneers in Brian\u2019s industry is Wernard, the proprietor of a leading marijuana garden center in Amsterdam. Now a professorial-looking fellow in his 40\u2032s, Wernard was present at the creation of the Sea of Green, working with expatriate American growers (and their seeds) to perfect the indoor cultivation of marijuana. On Saturday afternoon, he offered a packed hall of gardeners\u2014a surprisingly eclectic group that included, besides the expected array of aging and aspiring hippies, several middle-aged farmers, grad students and even a few sport-jacketed retirees\u2014an informative slide lecture on its history and development.\nWhat is perhaps most striking about the recent history of marijuana horticulture is that almost every one of the advances Wernard covered is a direct result of the opening of a new front in the United States drug war. Indeed, there probably would not be a significant domestic marijuana industry today if not for a large-scale program of unintentional Federal support.\nUntil the mid-70\u2032s, most of the marijuana consumed in this country was imported from Mexico. In 1975, United States authorities began working with the Mexican Government to spray Mexican marijuana fields with the herbicide paraquat, a widely publicized eradication program that ignited concerns about the safety of imported marijuana. At about the same time, the Coast Guard and the United States Border Patrol stepped up drug interdiction efforts along the nation\u2019s southern rim. Many observers believe that this crackdown encouraged smugglers to turn their attention from cannabis to cocaine, which is both more lucrative and easier to conceal. Meanwhile, with foreign supplies contracting and the Mexican product under a cloud, a large market for domestically grown marijuana soon opened up and a new industry, based principally in California and Hawaii, quickly emerged to supply it.\nAt the beginning, American growers were familiar with only one kind of marijuana: Cannabis sativa, an equatorial strain that can\u2019t withstand frost and won\u2019t reliably flower north of the 30th parallel. Eager to expand the range of domestic production, growers began searching for a variety that might flourish and flower farther north, and by the second half of the decade, it had been found: Cannabis indica, a stout, frost-tolerant species that had been cultivated for centuries in Afghanistan by hashish producers.\nCannabis indica looks quite unlike the familiar marijuana plant: it rarely grows taller than 4 or 5 feet (as compared to 15 feet for some sativas) and its deep bluish green leaves are rounded, rather than pointed. But the great advantage of Cannabis indica was that it allowed growers in all 50 states to cultivate sinsemilla for the first time.\nInitially, indicas were grown as purebreds. But enterprising growers soon discovered that by crossing the new variety with Cannabis sativa, it was possible to produce hybrids that combined the most desirable traits of both plants while playing down their worst. The smoother taste and what I often heard described as the \u201cclear, bell-like high\u201d of a sativa, for example, could be combined with the hardiness, small stature and higher potency of an indica. In a flurry of breeding work performed around 1980, most of it by amateurs working on the West Coast, the modern American marijuana plant\u2014Cannabis sativa x indica\u2014was born.\nBeginning in 1982, the D.E.A. launched an ambitious campaign to eradicate American marijuana farms. Yet despite vigorous enforcement throughout the 1980\u2032s, the share of the United States market that was home-grown actually doubled from 12 percent in 1984 to 25 percent in 1989, according to the D.E.A.\u2019s own estimates. (The figure may be as high as 50 percent today.) At the same time, D.E.A. policies unintentionally encouraged growers to develop a more potent product. \u201cLaw enforcement makes large-scale production difficult,\u201d explains Mark A. R. Kleiman, a drug policy analyst who worked in the Reagan Justice Department. \u201cSo growers had to figure out a way to make a living with a smaller but better-quality crop.\u201d In time, the marijuana industry came to resemble a reverse image of the automobile industry: domestic growers captured the upscale segment of the market with their steadily improving boutique product while the street trade was left to cheap foreign imports.\nThe Reagan Administration\u2019s war on drugs had another unintended effect on the marijuana industry: \u201cThe Government pushed growers indoors,\u201d says Allen St. Pierre, assistant national director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. \u201cBefore programs like CAMP\u201d\u2014the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting, which targeted outdoor growers in California from 1982 to 1985\u2014\u201dyou almost never heard about indoor grass.\u201d\nThe move indoors sparked an intensive period of research and development, including selective breeding for potency, size and early harvest, and a raft of technological advances aimed at speeding photosynthesis by manipulating the growing environment. Gardeners also learned how to clone their best female plants, thereby removing the unpredictability inherent in growing from seed. All these developments coalesced around 1987 in the growing regimen known as the Sea of Green, in which dozens of tightly packed and genetically identical female plants are grown in tight quarters under carefully regulated artificial conditions. Near the end of his lecture, Wernard flashed slides of several such gardens he\u2019d tended: green seas of happy-looking dwarf plants holding aloft enormous buds that elicited actual oohs and ahs from the gardeners in the audience.\nAs Wernard was quick to acknowledge, authorship for the Sea of Green belongs to no one horticulturist but rather to hundreds of gardeners working independently in the States and in the Netherlands and then sharing what they\u2019d learned, often in the columns of High Times and Sinsemilla Tips, a defunct quarterly that many growers refer to as \u201cthe bible.\u201d By 1989, their collective efforts had yielded exponential increases in the potency of American marijuana and earned the grudging respect of at least one D.E.A. agent, W. Michael Aldridge, who told a reporter on the eve of yet another crackdown (this time on indoor growers): \u201cI hate to sound laudatory, but the work they\u2019ve done on this plant is incredible.\u201d\nA Brilliant Career\nLocated in the red-light district directly across the street from a police station, the Greenhouse Effect is one of the 400 coffee shops in the Netherlands that serve marijuana. The place is little more than a dimly lighted corridor decorated in the Santa Fe style, with a cozy bar in the back. In addition to fruit drinks and snacks and an alarming-looking psychoactive pastry called \u201cspace cake,\u201d its menu offers a dozen different kinds of marijuana and hashish, sold either by the gram or the joint. The Greenhouse Effect is one of a handful of Amsterdam coffee shops that carry Brian\u2019s product, and one afternoon he agreed to meet me here to talk about his career.\nBrian showed up for our appointment a half an hour late (few of the people interviewed for this article were ever on time), carrying the plastic shopping bag that serves as his briefcase. While we sat at a cafe table sipping soft drinks, a selection of his buds laid out between us in Tupperware containers, Brian retraced the path that had brought him to Amsterdam from an upper-middle-class childhood in a suburb of Washington.\nThe oldest son of two doctors, Brian was a member of his high school\u2019s math and computer club when he began growing marijuana in 1986, though it was a friend in the drama club who got him started. The friend had been complaining about the price of marijuana, something Brian had never seen before, much less smoked. \u201cI said: \u2018Wait. This is a plant, right?\u2019 He says: \u2018Yeah, but it won\u2019t grow here. I\u2019ve tried.\u2019 \u201d Brian was already a gardener\u2014he raised tomatoes in his parents\u2019 backyard\u2014and growing marijuana seemed like an interesting challenge. \u201cIt was something to get me out of the computer club, put me on a slightly different level.\u201d He tracked down a growing manual at an adult bookstore in D.C. and soon figured out that his friend had probably been trying to grow an equatorial sativa, when only an indica could be expected to flower in Maryland. \u201cNow I was on a mission. I wanted to get the right seeds.\u201d\nHis mission took him to a performance by the Grateful Dead, whose concerts served in the 1980\u2032s as informal trading posts for the new indica hybrids being developed on the West Coast. Brian located the seeds he wanted, but he found the sight of so many Dead Heads strung out on drugs deeply unpleasant. \u201cIt left me with a bad taste about the whole experiment.\u201d Disgusted at the scene, he made a point of changing the names of the seeds he bought (\u201chippie-dippy names like \u2018Purple Flower Power\u2019 \u201c) to the more scientific system of letters and numbers he uses today: ST3, PB#3, B-Skunk x NL5.\nBrian\u2019s first crop of seedlings died after his little brother, worried the police would put his parents in jail, poured a bottle of Brut after-shave over them. Deciding he\u2019d better move the operation out of his house, Brian recruited a couple of kids from his Hebrew school class (\u201cI thought I could trust them a little more than the kids in my high school\u201d) and together they planted a string of backyard gardens. In October, they harvested their first crop, manicuring the buds according to the instructions in the book and hanging them to dry in one of the partner\u2019s attics. Many indicas exude a powerful, skunky smell and the parents quickly discovered the marijuana. \u201cThey told us to get it out of the house,\u201d Brian said. \u201cSo we moved the grass out to the shed with the lawn mower, which was good enough for them. It was like saying you were kosher even though you had Chinese food in a refrigerator out in the garage.\u201d\nSince Brian still had no interest in smoking marijuana (\u201cI was the farthest thing from drugs ever\u201d), he sold his share of the harvest, clearing several thousand dollars. \u201cMore money than I\u2019d ever seen in my life. I felt very elated and slightly guilty at the same time.\u201d Elated because his product was so popular it soon made a local name for itself and guilty because he knew some of it was finding its ways into the hands of young kids. \u201cThis was heavy-duty pot and it caused some serious problems\u2014at least one accident that I knew about. But I didn\u2019t know how responsible I was, because at the time I still hadn\u2019t smoked the stuff.\u201d\nAs we talked, a modest parade of customers made its way to the bar to purchase marijuana, some for takeout, others to smoke in. Even now, years after becoming a smoker, Brian is careful not to romanticize the drug. \u201cSmoking anything isn\u2019t good for you,\u201d he says, \u201cand smoking marijuana makes you stupid.\u201d Certainly the convention floor at the Cannabis Cup provided several cases in point, including one badly wasted fellow who introduced himself to me on five separate occasions, always with the same line: \u201cI\u2019m a smoker 32 years, living proof this weed doesn\u2019t damage you.\u201d\nBut Brian\u2019s disdain for drugs yielded before his fascination with the intricacies of growing and then breeding marijuana, something he soon discovered he had a talent for. Investing $1,000 of the proceeds from their first crop in a mail-order hydroponic growing system, Brian and his partners set out 100 plants in an unused sauna in one of their homes. Brian soon noticed that one of the plants was very unusual: it had dark purple stamens and a smell that overpowered the garden. He kept scrupulous records on each plant (storing his notes on a Macintosh computer equipped with an encryption program) and noted that the purple-haired plant was also one of the earliest to flower and heaviest yielding. It also turned out to be the most potent.\nBrian brought his \u201cPotomac Indica\u201d with him to college, where the response of his classmates convinced him that \u201cwhat I had was very special.\u201d Now working independently, he rented a house off campus and equipped it with a sophisticated growing system. Through a process of trial and error, Brian learned how to clone his Potomac Indica and more or less stumbled on the Sea of Green method for growing it. Through selective breeding, Brian developed several new strains, including one that he claims tested at 14 percent THC; THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the principal psychoactive compound in marijuana. According to the D.E.A., the THC content of marijuana during the 70\u2032s was between 0.5 and 2 percent; the average for indoor-grown sinsemilla today is between 8 and 10 percent. Brian\u2019s new strain was as potent as anything on the market.\nBy his junior year, Brian had a thriving business but his grades were suffering. He was also now a smoker. \u201cI said, \u2018O.K., you can do well in school or you can do well with the growing.\u2019 I made the wrong decision, I think.\u201d\nBrian dropped out of college in 1989 and turned professional. He opted for a highly decentralized operation, setting up a series of gardens in rented houses and apartments throughout the Washington area. Potomac Indica soon acquired a reputation. Brian reinvested his profits in the business, eventually building what amounted to a marijuana-growing franchise in towns up and down the Eastern Seaboard. In each region, Brian would select a local partner, set him up with equipment and clones, instruct him in the intricacies of the Sea of Green and then make regular on-site consultations in return for a percentage of the profits. Brian says he put 250,000 miles on a new car visiting grow rooms\u2014exactly how many, he wouldn\u2019t say\u2014spread out over a 1,200-mile stretch of Interstate 95.\n\u201cI did well with the growing,\u201d Brian offered, as he delicately minced a bud of his B-Skunk x ST4 with a pair of nail scissors and rolled a filtered joint. \u201cThe quality of my life has been one of extreme paranoia, however.\u201d\nDiscriminating Tastes\nOn the third afternoon of the convention, growers gathered in the main hall for a panel discussion covering some of the finer points of the Sea of Green. Picture a university lecture hall in a dream by Cheech and Chong. Although the panelists\u2014Wernard and two other growers\u2014started out as somber and technical as botany professors, over the course of their presentations they rolled and lit up a succession of huge joints and these eventually took their toll. By the end of the session, a cloud of marijuana smoke had spread out over the room, forcing me at one point to slide down off my chair in search of a vein of cool, non psychoactive air. For audio-visual aids, there were slides and potted cannabis plants on stage that the lecturers occasionally referred to with a pointer. It was all a little surreal, never more so than when Wernard mentioned his company\u2019s policy of requiring all employees to be marijuana smokers. It fell to an American in the back of the room to ask the inevitable question: \u201cDo you make them take urine tests?\u201d\nThe topic before the group was \u201cBio Versus Hydro.\u201d According to Steven Hager, the editor of High Times, \u201ca great schism\u201d has opened between the increasing number of indoor gardeners who grow in soil, often organically, and those who stand by chemical-based hydroponic methods. Wernard made a strong case for the superior quality of bio-grown marijuana; he claimed that hydroponic marijuana had a harsher, more chemical taste. Arjan, the owner of a popular coffee shop, pointed out that hydro yields were far greater. Even so, he acknowledged that in a taste test he had conducted among his patrons, bio had enjoyed a slight edge: of 810 smokers, 83.14 percent expressed a preference for bio, compared to 81.4 percent for hydro. No one seemed to notice that the percentages added up to a lot more than 100; evidently the respondents felt very positively about both samples in the test.\nI was surprised that, in the course of a two-hour panel discussion on marijuana growing, the subject of potency received relatively little attention. \u201cPeople may not need much stronger grass at this point,\u201d Brian later suggested. \u201cSo growers are concentrating on other qualities\u2014taste, variety, esthetics.\u201d Many of the conventioneers I talked to could discuss the distinctive qualities of various marijuanas with the passion and inventiveness of wine connoisseurs. Even the unsmoked buds were closely examined and intently sniffed\u2014this one admired for its rust-colored stamens, that one for the \u201cnotes\u201d of citrus or nutmeg in its bouquet.\nDuring the convention, I met a burly Manhattan dealer and law student who was eloquent on the subject of marijuana taste. When I asked his impressions of a new variety that had won a Cannabis Cup award, he praised its pronounced \u201cAfghani\u201d taste. \u201cAfghani is a big heavy smoky taste, really rich,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cBut it has what I think of as a \u2018pinpoint effect.\u2019 Swirling around inside that big taste is something else\u2014something sharper and thinner. The best way I can describe it is by analogy. You\u2019re familiar with Ben & Jerry\u2019s chocolate swirl? Well, it\u2019s got this great big overpowering chocolate taste, but then within that taste, you get the counterpoint of those fine swirls of fudge. That\u2019s the pinpoint effect.\u201d\nHe described the mental effects of the winning variety with almost as much exactitude. It produced a \u201crapid, enveloping high,\u201d he said, yet it had all the clarity of a fine sativa. Connoisseurs will often characterize a particular variety by situating it on a spectrum of marijuana highs ranging from the distinctly physical, narcotic effects of the archetypal indica to the comparatively stimulating, cerebral effects of a sativa. By manipulating the proportion of sativa genes to indica genes, breeders can design strains with precisely the effects they seek. Brian distinguishes between \u201cblue collar\u201d and \u201cwhite collar\u201d marijuanas. Customers who do physical work for a living \u201cwant to put their feet up at the end of the day and smoke a big, heavy indica,\u201d he told me; an urban professional might prefer something more \u201cuppy.\u201d\nConnoisseurship of this order tends to complicate one\u2019s view of marijuana as a drug, especially when you think about the sort of bootleg product Prohibition is remembered for\u2014just about anything with alcohol in it, some of it poisonous enough to blind or kill. Interestingly, most of the pot smokers I met expressed distaste for pills and white-powder drugs and disdain for their users. Marijuana connoisseurship suggests that, at least in this particular corner of the \u201cdrug culture,\u201d the accent is as much on the culture as it is on the drug.\nThe Indoor Drug War\nFew recent trends in the marijuana industry can be fully understood without reference to an event known among growers as \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d: Oct. 26, 1989. That was the day the Bush Administration officially began Green Merchant, the first organized offensive in the drug war to take direct aim at indoor marijuana growers\u2014and not only growers but also the legitimate companies that supplied their equipment and the publications that supplied much of their know-how. Along with a new Federal law that for the first time imposed mandatory sentences based on the number, rather than weight, of plants seized (5 years for 100 plants, 10 years for 1,000), Green Merchant radically altered the rules by which indoor growers operate. Six years later, the industry is still adapting to the new environment.\nA D.E.A. agent named Jim Seward conceived Green Merchant in 1987 while thumbing through a copy of High Times. As he told a reporter in 1989, the magazine \u201cjust seemed to be a middleman in a dope deal.\u201d By that time, the indoor marijuana industry was so large and well established, and so easy to enter thanks to the mail-order equipment stores and seed companies advertising in High Times and Sinsemilla Tips, that the Administration felt compelled to act. In the last week of October 1989, the D.E.A. raided hundreds of indoor growers and dozens of retail garden supply stores in 46 states, seizing equipment and customer lists. Virtually all the stores targeted by Green Merchant had advertised in High Times or Sinsemilla Tips, and the raids scared off enough advertisers to push Sinsemilla Tips out of business.\nUsing customer records seized from the grow stores, as well as 21,000 additional leads that the D.E.A. says it obtained from the United Parcel Service, law enforcement agencies undertook investigations of thousands of indoor growers, who soon discovered they weren\u2019t as safe in their homes as they\u2019d assumed. Now merely ordering garden supplies from the wrong company could bring drug agents to your door, as scores of African violet and orchid fanciers have been astonished to discover.\nWith the names and addresses of tens of thousands of suspects now in hand, law enforcement agencies developed a large appetite for indoor marijuana busts. \u201cMarijuana growers are easy targets,\u201d Allen St. Pierre of Norml says. As criminals, many of them are docile and amateurish, leaving behind a trail of U.P.S. records and credit card receipts as they set up their gardens; once established, a marijuana garden is much easier to find than any white-powder drug operation and arresting officers are far less likely to encounter resistance. Another powerful incentive is the asset forfeiture rules, which were liberalized during the drug war to allow agencies to keep the proceeds of whatever they seize. Since the crime of growing marijuana is by its very nature tied to a particular place\u2014a house and a plot of land\u2014seizing the assets of pot growers is particularly easy. All these factors help explain why, according to Norml, there were more arrests in 1994 for crimes involving marijuana than for all other illicit drugs combined.\nI was curious to know how the D.E.A. explained its priorities, but the agency did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. However, in a recent internal report, entitled \u201cCalifornia Cannabis Cultivation: Marijuana in the 90\u2032s,\u201d the agency defended Green Merchant, and its war on marijuana generally, as a necessary response to \u201ca rapidly escalating problem.\u201d The report claimed that marijuana was a \u201cgateway drug\u201d leading to the use of more serious drugs; that THC posed \u201cpotential health hazards,\u201d which the increasing \u201cquality and quantity\u201d of domestic marijuana were making even worse, and that chemical runoffs from marijuana farms posed a threat to the environment. \u201cThere is good scientific reason,\u201d the report concluded, for \u201cgrouping marijuana with other very serious and harmful drugs.\u201d\nWhatever the rationale, the war against marijuana is expensive\u2014as much as $1.7 billion in criminal justice costs each year, by one estimate. And that fact, sooner than any shift in the ideological climate, is what could prove its undoing. In an era of shrinking government budgets, locking up nonviolent drug offenders becomes harder to rationalize. Last month, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, looking to slash government spending, proposed relaxing the state\u2019s mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, some of whom may even be released. If they aren\u2019t already, marijuana growers should probably be voting Republican, since Republicans alone have the financial incentive, and the political cover, to reassess the costs and benefits of the drug war they started.\nLike D.E.A. campaigns before it, Green Merchant failed to close down the marijuana industry, but it has altered the way it operates. One response to the post-Green Merchant environment was Brian\u2019s: to decentralize operations, keeping each grow room as small as possible\u2014ideally, fewer than 100 plants. As Brian reasoned, even if one garden were raided, others would continue to generate cash for a defense. In the wake of Green Merchant, growers also began paying attention to such mundane things as \u201ceffluents\u201d\u2014especially odors and heat\u2014and kilowatt hours, since judges will now issue warrants to search houses emitting unusual amounts of heat or consuming large amounts of electricity.\nBy 1991, Brian felt he \u201cwas sitting on top of a very large time bomb.\u201d Friends had also begun to tell him he was wasting his life. But what Brian most wanted was to be legitimate, not to give up growing and breeding marijuana. So he sold his gardens, told his parents about his secret life (\u201cI was excommunicated\u201d) and moved to Amsterdam. Here, he joined a community of emigre Americans that revolves around the culture of marijuana in much the same way earlier communities of emigres in Europe sprang up around avant-garde literature or painting while awaiting acceptance at home. At least that\u2019s how some of them choose to see it. Marijuana growers are almost touching in their faith that America will soon come to its senses and legalize their trade. Prohibition, so quickly recognized as folly, is their great sustaining myth.\nInto the Cybergarden\nOn my last day in Amsterdam, Brian took me on a tour of his expatriate world. The community\u2019s epicenter\u2014its La Coupole\u2014is the C.I.A.: Cannabis in Amsterdam, a combination shop, gathering place and hemp store located in a large second-story loft a short walk from Central Station. The afternoon Brian and I dropped by was the last day of the Cannabis Cup and Americans were lining up to buy seeds to take home. (Tiny and odorless, marijuana seeds are not difficult to smuggle.) With their glossy, four-color photographs and extravagant promises, the catalogues they consulted might have been published by Burpee. I asked Adam Dunn, one of the two Americans who run the C.I.A., what had been his big sellers that week. Hindu Kush had sold out, he said, and AK 47 was moving briskly, even at $30 a seed. (The 47 refers to the number of days till harvest.) Everybody was also asking for a variety called Bubble Gum, which smells more like Bazooka than marijuana, making it one of the safest\u2014that is, least detectable\u2014indoor varieties to grow.\nNext, Brian suggested we stop by Positronics, Wernard\u2019s garden center, where Brian occasionally shops. Positronics is a sleek, sprawling showroom and factory, offering the indoor grower everything from specially blended and aged organic soil mixes to state-of-the-art carbon dioxide systems and a selection of clones\u2014robust four-inch-tall marijuana plants sold in peat pots for $3 to $6 apiece.\nWernard escorted us through a warren of white-tiled rooms where employees working in a small assembly line cut, trimmed and rooted clones, producing several thousand each week. Watching the gardeners at work in their windowless cubicles, deftly transforming one plant into a dozen over and over again, I understood why the Netherlands had become such an important model for indoor marijuana growers. Horticulture in Holland has always been a matter of artifice, of forcing nature in every sense. Almost all of Holland\u2019s farmland is man-made, reclaimed from the North Sea (the recent flood notwithstanding) by dint of effort and technology. Cursed with little sunlight and even less space, the Dutch have also had to master the art of indoor growing\u2014of, essentially, combining large quantities of electricity and chemical fertilizer with the best plant genetics available to create gorgeous flowers, picture-perfect tomatoes and, now, some of the world\u2019s most refined marijuana plants.\nSipping tea in Positronics\u2019 gleaming showroom, Wernard and Brian fell to talking about the future of their industry. Both agreed that the Sea of Green was here to stay, though there was still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of safety (with more sophisticated effluent controls) and yield. Wernard claimed that yields of 800 grams per square meter, already attainable by top growers using carbon dioxide, will soon be routine and that advances in genetics could add another 150 grams to that\u2014almost a kilo of sinsemilla every two months in a space no bigger than a phone booth.\nPerhaps the most important advances in marijuana cultivation involve computerization, which promises to revolutionize growing and vastly complicate the work of law enforcement agencies. Over dinner, Brian limned his vision of the ultimate post-Green Merchant grow room: the cybergarden. Sensors will monitor the five important environmental factors (light, water, humidity, carbon dioxide levels and temperature) and feed the information to a personal computer. Using solenoid switches, a so-called \u201csmart interface\u201d and a bit of customized programming, the computer can track and automatically adjust all these variables, either according to a preset program or to instructions typed in by the gardener. Add a modem and a remote-access program, and the grower can tend his garden from anywhere in the world.\nI was skeptical; it sounded a lot like the kind of rococo fantasies that pot smokers have always liked to spin\u2014in this one, the 60\u2032s drug culture joins forces with the 90\u2032s hacker culture to outwit a common enemy. But Brian referred me to a recent series of articles on computer gardening in High Times and The Growing Edge, a magazine for legal high-tech growers (published by the former publisher of Sinsemilla Tips), that described similar setups. He also told me about a company in New Hampshire where, I later confirmed, one could purchase both the hardware and software needed to set up exactly the kind of cybergarden Brian had outlined.\nBrian also talked about incorporating security features in his garden: a motion detector and a \u201cMayday\u201d program that would dial his beeper number in the event of a security breach, bringing the news never to return. But wouldn\u2019t the police be able to trace the gardener through information on the computer? Not if the data stream were sent through a remailer first, Brian explained. Remailers are anonymous mail drops that computer hackers have set up on the Internet, untraceable E-mail addresses where one can send or receive encrypted data. An article in the October High Times offered plans for a similar security system, adding one diabolical twist. By incorporating a computer virus like Viper or Deicide in the system, the computer could be programmed essentially to self-destruct as soon as it detected a security breach and alerted the gardener, rendering it worthless as evidence.\nHigh Times describes cybergardening as \u201can exciting technology that has raced far ahead of ethics, law enforcement and government and corporate control.\u201d Indeed. The technology will make it possible for a grower like Brian to tend his franchise gardens from the safety of a computer in Amsterdam; theoretically at least, he would need to visit the grow room only to plant and to harvest. In the future, the D.E.A. may find the gardens but not the gardeners.\nA Garden Tour\nOn my last night in Amsterdam, Brian finally consented to let me visit his garden. Evidently the gardener\u2019s reflexive exhibitionism had triumphed over the outlaw\u2019s professional discretion. I remembered something Allen St. Pierre of Norml had told me: that the most common way for a grower to get caught is by boasting about his garden. He had shown me snapshots of prize plants that gardeners had mailed to Norml, sometimes in envelopes marked with return addresses.\nThe garden was in a working-class village half an hour north of Amsterdam. On the train, seated next to his plastic shopping bag, Brian explained that one of the reasons he chose to grow in this particular town is that it is home to a candy factory, a bakery and a chemical plant; together, they produce a cacophony of odors that overwhelms the smell emanating from his garden\u2014important since the Dutch police sometimes raid marijuana gardens.\nBrian also talked excitedly about his plans for the future, which include a legitimate seed company that will specialize in strains of medical marijuana geared toward specific ailments. \u201cThe same strain that helps glaucoma patients might not be the best one for polar disorders, and vice versa,\u201d he said. The week before, Brian had told his parents of his business plans, and their reaction had been positive. \u201cAfter five years, I\u2019m finally getting recognition from my family,\u201d he had told me earlier. Evidently, the two doctors and their son the marijuana grower had reconciled. \u201cI\u2019m going to be helping people.\u201d\nFrom the station, we walked through a tightly packed development of tiny cookie-cutter houses pressed up against the street. The Dutch shun curtains, and each gleaming picture window presented a diorama of Dutch life, illuminated by the glow of a television screen. We came to a modest, gambrel-roofed house and Brian showed me upstairs. At the end of a dark, narrow and hopelessly cluttered corridor, he opened a tightly sealed door. I was hit full in the face by a blast of searing white light and an overpowering stench: sweaty, vegetal, sulfurous, sickening.\nAfter my eyes adjusted to the light, I stepped into a windowless room not much bigger than a walk-in closet, crammed with electrical equipment, snaked with cables and plastic tubing and completely sealed off from the outside world. More than half the room was taken up by Brian\u2019s Sea of Green. The six-foot table was invisible beneath a jungle of dark, serrated leaves oscillating gently in an artificial breeze. There were a hundred clones, each scarcely a foot tall but already sending forth a thick finger of hairy calyxes. A network of plastic pipes supplied the plants with water, a tank of carbon dioxide sweetened their air, a ceramic heater warmed their roots at night and four 600-watt sodium lamps bathed them in a blaze of light for 12 hours of every day. During the other 12, they were sealed in perfect darkness. The briefest lapse of light, Brian noted gravely, could ruin the whole crop.\nThere was nothing of beauty here in this cramped chamber, and yet to a gardener there was much to admire. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen plants that looked more pleased, this despite the fact they were being forced to grow under the most unnatural of circumstances\u2014overbred, overfed, overstimulated, sped up and pygmied all at once. \u201cMore!\u201d the marijuana plants seemed to say, sucking up the carbon dioxide, gorging on the fertilizer, throwing themselves at bulbs so hot and bright I finally had to look away. In return for a regimen of encouragement few plants have ever known, these 100 eager dwarfs would oblige their gardener with three pounds of sinsemilla before the month was out. Thousands of dollars worth of flowers.\nIt was all a little bit mad, and yet a gardener couldn\u2019t help but be impressed, even as I counted the minutes before I could politely make my exit and draw an ordinary breath. Only later, on the train back to Amsterdam, did I fix on what may be the maddest part of all: that the credit for this most dubious of achievements belonged not only to the gifted, obsessed gardener and his willing plants but to the obsessions of a Government as well.\n"}, {"score": 1077.2546, "uuid": "4b2205c7-dc8c-54af-b8dc-3b8431c76a50", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0310wb-50-24344", "target_hostname": "gulfbusiness.tradeholding.com", "target_uri": "http://gulfbusiness.tradeholding.com/default.cgi/action/viewcompanies/buyers-importers-distributors/plastic/", "page_rank": 1.1742206e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Plastic</em> Buyers, <em>Plastic</em> Importers, <em>Plastic</em> Distributors, <em>Plastic</em> Wholesalers", "snippet": "We are regularly Buying: <em>plastic</em> <em>pots</em>, fertilizers, recycled teak wood furniture, stone, <em>ceramic</em> <em>pots</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Axioma\nWe started as a furniture manufacturing company in 1990 with skilled workers of over 400 peaople in our manufacturing line.

But prescription drug overdoses rose.\nThis Week in Health - April 13, 2012\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wants farm animals to stop getting antibiotics to help them grow. The FDA this week asked drug makers to sell these drugs to farmers only when needed for health reasons. An Arkansas judge this week fined Johnson & Johnson $1.1 billion for fraud against the state Medicaid program. A jury found the drug maker guilty of hiding potential risks of Risperdal. This drug is used to treat schizophrenia. A study published this week found that the most common type of brain tumor occurs more often among people who have had frequent dental X-rays. The type of tumor, meningioma, is usually not cancerous. Other new research found higher rates of autism for children whose mothers were obese while pregnant. And a study released in time for tax filing day found that the rate of fatal traffic accidents goes up on tax days.\nThis Week in Health - April 06, 2012\nNine doctors' groups this week urged their members and patients to think twice about some types of care. The groups published lists of tests and procedures that they said are often not needed. Unrelated research this week also talked about excess treatment. The study estimated that 15% to 25% of cancers found by a mammogram don't need to be treated. Other research found a possible reason for black women's higher rates of cervical cancer and death from it. They may not clear the infection that causes the cancer from their bodies as quickly as white women. In other infectious disease news, U.S. health officials this week were looking into a multi-state outbreak of salmonella.\nThis Week in Health - March 23, 2012\nThe mild winter has led to an early allergy season in parts of the United States, health officials said this week. New research concludes that many low-risk patients are getting more costly anesthesia than they need for a colonoscopy. A group of experts released a report this week on dissolvable tobacco products. They said the products may be less dangerous than smoking. On the other hand, they may encourage more people to use tobacco.\nThis Week in Health - March 16, 2012\nSeveral expert groups announced new screening guidelines for cervical cancer this week. They say that women over 30 can safely get a Pap test only every 5 years under certain conditions. A study that kept track of men's health for 11 years after prostate cancer screening found that those who were screened did not live longer than other men. They were less likely to die of prostate cancer, however. The U.S. government launched an anti-smoking campaign this week. It features advertisements with graphic images showing people harmed by smoking. British researchers this week urged doctors to stop using all-metal hip replacements. Medical records showed that these devices are more likely to fail than ceramic or plastic replacements.\nThis Week in Health - March 09, 2012\nThe American Heart Association said this week that doctors need to give more information to people with heart failure. The group said patients need to know whether treatments are likely to help them feel better as well as live longer. Research published this week describes a new way of doing kidney transplants. People received a mixture of their own bone marrow and marrow from their kidney donor. Five out of eight were able to stop taking immune suppressant drugs within a year.

It found that people who smoked up to a joint of pot a week had no increased risk of lung damage.\nThis Week in Health - January 06, 2012\nTwin births have jumped in the United States since 1980, health officials said this week. In other government news, advisers urged U.S. health officials to change the definition of lead poisoning. They said the current threshold for blood lead in children should be cut in half. This could lead to diagnosis of many thousands more children. Also this week, drug regulators issued their first rules limiting the use of antibiotics in animals raised for food.\nThis Week in Health - December 23, 2011\nThe U.S. government this week issued its first rules limiting toxic emissions from power plants. Congress authorized the rules in 1990. The Department of Health and Human Services this week sought to limit release of details on a new, lab-engineered bird flu virus. The virus spreads easily between mammals. The officials said details on how it was made could help terrorists. French officials this week advised women with one type of breast implant to have them removed as a precaution. About 1,000 implants have ruptured.\nThis Week in Health - December 09, 2011\nA conference this week produced news about breast cancer treatment using both drugs and radiation. Two studies reported promising results on new treatments for advanced breast cancer. Another study showed lower survival with a more limited type of radiation treatment. A fourth study found that a gene test may predict which women with very early breast cancers need radiation. A U.S. cabinet official decided this week to block over-the-counter sales of the \"morning-after pill\" to girls under age 17. That's the current rule. However, drug regulators had wanted to remove it. A report released this week said that low-risk prostate cancers may need a new name. A less-scary name might encourage men to avoid treatment they probably don't need. The expert panel that wrote the report said more research is needed on monitoring these men to figure out when or if they need treatment.\nThis Week in Health - December 02, 2011\nOnly about 1 in 4 Americans infected with HIV has the virus under control, a report released this week says. The New York City health department said treatment should start earlier, and President Obama called for more funding. Lipitor, the popular cholesterol medicine, lost patent protection this week. But it's taking aggressive steps to keep sales high. More parents are refusing vaccines, the Associated Press says. Rates now exceed 5% in 8 states. A new study suggests that doctors who own MRI machines are more likely to order tests for patients who don't need them. And the governors of two states this week asked U.S. drug enforcement officials to change the legal status of marijuana. The change would allow doctors to prescribe it and pharmacies to dispense it legally.\nThis Week in Health - November 18, 2011\nThe U.S. Supreme Court said this week that it will consider a challenge to the health care reform law adopted in 2010. Among other things, the law requires people to buy health insurance. A lower court said that this violates the Constitution. Congress prepared this week to vote on a bill that would cancel some changes to school lunch nutrition rules. The Agriculture Department proposed the changes in the spring. A study released this week found that stroke risk varies for people of different blood types. Another study found that 1 out of 5 U.S. adults takes a drug related to mental health or behavior.\nThis Week in Health - November 11, 2011\nA human rights group filed a claim against the United Nations this week on behalf of Haitians harmed by the cholera epidemic. The group blames the UN for the epidemic. It says that peacekeeping troops caused it through poor sanitation. A study released this week found that babies who grow very quickly are more likely to become obese. Another study suggests that children with autism have extra cells in parts of their brain. A third study published this week supports a change in rules for liver transplants given to alcoholics. It suggests that carefully selected patients should not have to wait six months before a transplant to prove they can stay sober.\nThis Week in Health - November 04, 2011\nHaving less than a drink a day of alcohol can increase women's risk of breast cancer. So says a study released this week. Another study offered good news for children with an attention disorder. It found that medicines for this condition do not increase the risk of heart problems. U.S. officials said this week that overdose deaths caused by prescription painkillers have tripled in the last decade. Other officials this week approved a new device to help doctors detect melanoma. And President Obama issued an order to increase government efforts to prevent shortages of some medicines.\nThis Week in Health - October 28, 2011\nHormone levels change after a large weight loss and stay that way for at least a year, a study released this week found. The net effect is to increase hunger, researchers said. Other research this week found that BPA exposure may affect girls' behavior. Girls who were exposed to bisphenol-A before birth had less control of feelings and behavior. An expert panel that advises the U.S. government said this week that boys also should get a vaccine now given to girls. The shots protect against human papilloma virus. In other vaccine news, researchers said that seasonal flu shots protect only 59% of adults who get them from flu infection. As Occupy Wall Street protests continue, sanitation issues were reported this week in several cities.\nThis Week in Health - October 21, 2011\nA new vaccine reduces the risk of malaria in young children by about half, researchers announced this week. No vaccine is available now against the deadly disease. In other world health news, China said it has vaccinated 9 million people against polio. The campaign was launched to fight an outbreak in one region. Annual cancer screenings drew more criticism this week. An expert task force said Pap tests are needed only every three years. These tests are used to screen women for cervical cancer. And new research found that women were more likely to have a false alarm from test results if they got mammograms every year. Abnormal test results that did not turn out to be breast cancer were less common when the tests occurred every two years. Other researchers said this week that hospital stays for heart failure fell by nearly one-third in the last decade.\n"}, {"score": 734.93677, "uuid": "4bdfa5a8-2159-5a7e-b099-e1e8faea26ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0204wb-35-27944", "target_hostname": "www.healthsecrets.ws", "target_uri": "http://www.healthsecrets.ws/2008/05/24/", "page_rank": 1.2284003e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Health</em> Secrets \u00bb 2008 \u00bb May \u00bb 24", "snippet": "But the choice and maintenance <em>of</em> potted <em>plants</em> can pose some difficulties.

Are our friends having more sex than we do? Do any other couples have this problem where one partner has high desire, and the other one has little to none? There must be something really wrong with us! Everyone wants sex 24/7 don\u2019t they? The answer to these most commonly asked questions are no. Not really. More than 40 million Americans feel stuck in low-sex or no sex marriages. Research studies tell us that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 7 men reported little to no sexual desire. Sometime in a marriage more than 50% of couples experience one or both partners with little to no sexual desire.\nIssues regarding desire are the most common issue of couples in sex therapy. Many times this is the unspoken complaint of couples entering relationship therapy. First I rule out any physical or biological medical problems. Given this, it is recommended to make an appointment with your general medical doctor, or get a referral from your sex therapist, a board certified sexologist. Your therapist will recommend that the medical doctor run a hormonal profile along with a physical exam to rule out any other problems, such as medical disease or medications that could lessen your libido.\nThis is a preview of\nHow Much Sex Is In A Normal Marriage?\n"}, {"score": 697.7827, "uuid": "31009b31-0255-5a09-b00b-4b915aafab6c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1011wb-56-19391", "target_hostname": "1greengeneration.elementsintime.com", "target_uri": "http://1greengeneration.elementsintime.com/?cat=154", "page_rank": 1.4406168e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Health</em> | One Green Generation", "snippet": "The woman at my <em>health</em> food store suggested for the first time that I use one that <em>is</em> <em>plastic</em> and light-weight.

I wasn\u2019t nurturing myself and I was taking my self for granted. \u00a0As a result, I wasn\u2019t very healthy.\nRe-Visiting My Wellness Plan\nIn January, here\u2019s what I said: \u00a0By the End of the Year I Hope To\u2026\nLift my arms over my head! How am I doing? \u00a0Well, at the beginning of the year, I couldn\u2019t get much past lifting my arms to straight in front of me. \u00a0So sad! \u00a0And now I have just a few degrees to go before I can lift them all the way over my head. \u00a0That\u2019s due to stretching, yoga, and an amazing massage therapist who has helped cut through years of scar tissue in my frozen shoulders.\nLearn to live happily gluten-free. I\u2019m still gluten-free and getting used to asking about ingredients in stores and restaurants. I\u2019ve even started becoming dairy free this month. My body LOVES it. \u00a0I was a size 8 in January. \u00a0Now I\u2019m a size 2. \u00a0I actually haven\u2019t lost a lot of weight, most of it has been inflammation.\nFigure out my next career step. I\u2019m getting a whole lot closer. \u00a0I now have several clients who are all doing amazing work \u2013 it\u2019s extremely gratifying to help them do their work better, and I\u2019m feeling increasingly empowered and effective as a consultant. \u00a0You can see what I\u2019m doing here . \u00a0Every week my feet are more firmly planted in the consulting and storytelling world, and my stress level decreases.\nReduce my medications for asthma to just the rescue inhaler. I have reduced my asthma meds over the years from seven down to just one now, aside from the rescue inhaler. \u00a0I got rid of 2 of them just this year. \u00a0I think it\u2019s going to take a little longer than I expected, but I have confidence that I\u2019ll be able to get rid of that one too in 2012.\nExercise regularly. I walk to work every day \u2013 that\u2019s about 2 miles a day. \u00a0I was doing yoga about 4-5 days/week until I injured myself . \u00a0Since then I\u2019ve been working back up to yoga by doing a few gentle or Yin classes, plus stretching and exercises. \u00a0I am going to take a few private classes so I can learn to modify my practice to take better care of my body. \u00a0So I still hope by the end of the year I\u2019ll be back to doing yoga regularly.\nIncrease my number of social interactions.

Yes, so this is an essential component of healing. \u00a0Every time I make progress in this arena, I find there is a new level of growing and learning. \u00a0It is fascinating and very rewarding.\nPart of this is understanding that when I have neck pain, it\u2019s not just about the neck, for example. \u00a0It is about the need for a new glasses prescription (I was leaning my neck to be able to see), long-term shoulder problems (not allowing my neck to heal), stress (tensing up without even knowing it), working too long of hours (putting added strain on my body), and more.\nReduce and maintain a lower weight that feels good. I could lose a couple more pounds to feel really good, but I\u2019m pretty darn close. \u00a0I\u2019m much happier with my body today than I was a year ago. \u00a0Though to the point above, it\u2019s not just about the weight, it\u2019s about the diet, the inflammation, the exercise, and the mental wellbeing.\nHow About You?\nHow have you done with the promises you\u2019ve made to yourself this year? \u00a0Have you stuck with them?\nDo You Use An Eco-Friendly Air Freshener?\nI\u2019ve been receiving a lot of reader questions lately. \u00a0It seem you all are pushing me to write again! \u00a0Ok, I\u2019m trying to clear off my work load so I can get back to writing. \u00a0I miss it, too!\nIn the meantime, anyone have some good solutions for Sam?\nHi Melinda,\nDo you have any suggestions on what one could use to freshen up a room or kitchen that is both cost effective and not damaging to ones health?\nI use the store bought air fresheners but I am thinking they are probably not all that healthly am I right?

Many thanks to all of you who left me good wishes via email and Facebook .\nA few weeks ago I started feeling a dull pain in my elbow. A week later, I had pretty severe pain in my neck. Soon after, the pain radiated from my neck, through my shoulders, down my arm, and into my fingers. Finally, it was accompanied by occasional numbness and a feeling that my elbow was on fire.\nOver a few weeks, I was in so much pain that I couldn\u2019t think straight!\nFirst Stop\nFirst stop on the road to wellness, I went to a conventional physician \u2013 a new one because we have new health insurance. \u00a0She evaluated me for 2 minutes or so (no kidding) and told me I had nondescript pain in my neck and shoulders, with fairly severe tennis elbow. \u00a0Then she gave me a referral to physical therapy. \u00a0And that was it.\nSecond Stop\nI promptly called physical therapy, and they told me I couldn\u2019t see one person for those three different things: they had a neck and shoulders physical therapist, and an elbow therapist \u2013 I\u2019d have to see both. \u00a0And the next available appointment was 1 week away for the neck and shoulders, and 3 weeks away for the elbow. \u00a0Oh, and they were in two different locations.\nTrying to explain that my neck bone was connected to my shoulder bone, and shoulder bone is connected to the elbow bone\u2026 didn\u2019t work. Nope, there wasn\u2019t anyone who could do that.\nI was in so much pain my eyes were tearing, I was grumpy, and I was having real difficulty concentrating on my work. \u00a0The only time the pain subsided at all was if I was lying in bed in one particular position. And here I was faced with another 3 weeks of this sharp, radiating pain before comfort was even in sight.\nThird Stop\nSo I made an appointment with my Naturopathic Doctor . \u00a0He saw me just 2 days later.\nInstantly Kevin sensed I was in a lot of pain. \u00a0He spent 1/2 hour with me, learning exactly what was going on \u2013 by talking, moving and feeling my joints, and testing my strength and mobility.\nHis diagnosis: \u00a0Nerve pain in my neck. \u00a0I have a bad disc in my neck, that was probably injured back when I was in a car accident long ago and has now been re-injured. Ah, I realized, I\u2019ve had tingling in my fingers for a long time.\nAt the same time, I managed also to get tennis elbow \u2013 probably from hyperextending my arms in my new yoga practice. \u00a0So the two injuries were aggravating one another. \u00a0(Because the neck bone is connected to the shoulder bone\u2026 and so on.)\nKevin gently and carefully adjusted my neck and back. He gave me exercises. And pharmaceuticals (at that point I was ready). And specific vitamin supplements \u2013 for short-term and long-term healing. And orders to rest and ice as often as possible. And orders to make my desk even more ergonomic than it already is. \u00a0And to modify my yoga postures when I go back to yoga.\nThat was 2 weeks ago. I am finally able to concentrate for a full day at work. \u00a0Though I still get awfully tired \u2013 I have a difficult time getting up in the morning and I\u2019m ready to go home by 4pm, exhausted. The pain is still there but it\u2019s not mind-numbing anymore.\nThe Abyss Of Pain\nI\u2019m sure some of you have been to this place: the abyss of pain. \u00a0It\u2019s a cloudy-headed, self-absorbed, cranky and impatient, dark hole of dispair and disrepair. \u00a0In that abyss, your brain can really only focus solidly on the immediate needs before you.\nHave you been there?\nIt\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m lucky that the people around me understand, support and forgive me.\nIf \u00a0you ever find yourself in that abyss, first be sure to tell others around you what you\u2019re going through \u2013 otherwise they won\u2019t know, can\u2019t support you, and might be less willing to forgive you for your impatience. And second, be sure to advocate for yourself until you get the care you need to overcome the pain.\nNow it\u2019s like a fog is lifting.\u00a0I can write again. I can see the bigger picture again \u2013 the bigger picture of life, of business , of the planet\u2026\nHello again.\n"}, {"score": 691.3911, "uuid": "41c689b4-d629-5313-ad35-cd84f0be6b3f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-35-24474", "target_hostname": "www.opp.psu.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.opp.psu.edu/planning-construction/design_and_construction_standards/division-23-heating-ventilating-hvac", "page_rank": 1.4636473e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Division 23 \u2014 Office <em>of</em> Physical <em>Plant</em>", "snippet": "All piping located <em>in</em> mechanical rooms, <em>or</em> for a distance <em>of</em> 50\u2019, whichever <em>is</em> greater.

Born in a bamboo house in Chinchina, Colombia, bamboo construction was common in his state, where many residential and public buildings were constructed using this cheap and widely available material. Like most homes, in his house the bamboo was hidden beneath plaster, and indeed, it looked like it was made of brick. After he left the university, Oscar was intrigued by the possibilities of using bamboo in construction, and embarked on a project to construct a country club kiosk 23 meters in diameter using this material. Five days before the opening ceremony, there was a hurricane which distorted the building extremely, moving the kingpost 90 cm off-center. After only two hours of working with a winch, however, the structure was successfully moved back into place without collapsing. He was sold on bamboo. Amazed at its structural integrity and aesthetic possibilities, he embarked on a program of research which has taken him to Asia, Costa Rica, Brazil, and elsewhere to study this plant and to create experimental structures.

They enhance and transform gardens into peaceful sanctuaries of light, movement and space, touching our spirits and stirring our souls. Bamboo can beguile and possess. So be forewarned, you may shortly find yourself becoming ensnared with bamboo magic!\nOver 1000 species of bamboo in 90 genera have been described and named. The current rate of discovery suggests many more are still unknown. They come in a staggering variety of colors, sizes and shapes. Some creep along the ground only a few inches tall, others soar freestanding to over 100 feet. Some grow in tight clumps, others in open groves. Some even clamber up trees. The leaves of some species grow only half an inch long, while others reach a couple of feet. Many species have beautifully variegated culms (stems) and leaves.\nThe diversity of species is perhaps not too surprising when one considers the many environments in which they have evolved. Indigenous bamboos are widely found throughout Asia, Africa, Australia, and North and South America. They have evolved to fill a variety of ecological niches, ranging from tropical lowland to alpine highland, from rain forest to dry chaparral, and from acid to alkaline soils.\nBamboo Sourcery offers an extensive variety of bamboo plants in many sizes, ranging from the shippable 1 gal and 5 gal sizes to magnificent giant timber specimens 30 to 40 feet tall in large tubs. Our beautiful and unique demonstration gardens and expert advice enable you to select the best varieties for your needs. All stock is container-established and ready for planting. Special orders are welcome, and we deliver within the greater Bay Area. Delivery cost is based on distance. Removal services are offered on a case-by-case basis when staff time is available. We also carry bamboo root barriers, fertilizer, fencing, poles, garden accessories and books. Most of these items and many of our plants can be viewed in color photos on our website at bamboosourcery.com.\nOur Bamboo Price List is always accessible on our website and is also available by mail upon request. Our Price List is updated frequently and includes information about size, running/clumping type, sun exposure, cold tolerance, maximum heights possible in their ideal native environments, and current availability for each plant. Prices are listed for the smaller size containers (1 gal and 5 gal), suitable for shipping anywhere in the country.\nThis entire Information Supplement can be printed from our website (see Printable Versions for Part I and Part II), and is also available in black and white hard copy to mail order for $3.00.\nThe nursery and gardens, located 1\u00bc hrs drive north of San Francisco, is open by appointment only, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays (days and hours may vary seasonally).

And it CONSUMES MORE CARBON DIOXIDE than any other plant!\nSustainably Harvested & Annually Renewable: Mature bamboos produce new shoots and canes each year, which can be harvested individually without destroying the plant.\nFastest Growing Plant on the Planet: New shoots of some tropical species have been clocked growing up to 4 FEET PER DAY in their shooting season!\nEnvironmental Cleanup: Bamboo plants are very effective at removing metals and other toxic substances from soils and water.\nDiverse: There are over 1500 SPECIES of bamboo in the world.\nStronger Than Steel: Bamboo has a TENSILE STRENGTH of 28,000 per square inch, vs. 23,000 for steel.\nProvides Safe Housing: Over 1 billion people in the world live in BAMBOO HOUSES. Bamboo buildings have proven to be exceedingly earthquake proof.\nNutrition for Humans and Animals: BAMBOO SHOOTS have been eaten throughout Asia for centuries, and branches and leaves make good fodder for animals. It contains Germanium, which reverses the aging process in cells.\nAncient Healing: Various parts of many bamboo species have been used in CHINESE AND AYURVEDIC MEDICINE for centuries.\nDid You Know? Thomas Edison used bamboo filaments in his first LIGHT BULBS, and one of those bulbs is STILL burning today at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC!\nHardy: Bamboo was the first PLANT LIFE to return after the atomic bombings in Japan. Also, some bamboos are cold hardy to -20 degrees F.\nHow Bamboos Grow\nBamboos grow in fits and starts. For much of the year nothing much appears to be happening, and then in one brief season they explode with growth. In general, the first year or two after transplanting, you will not see tremendous above-ground growth, as the plant is putting most of its energy into its root system.\nDuring the summer and fall, most species manufacture and store sugars in their rhizomes. Rhizomes produce the roots, top growth, and new rhizomes. Then in spring and sometimes fall, they pump the accumulated energy into new shoots (culms), which achieve all of their height in about 30-60 days. The branches and leaves develop in another 30-60 days. Shoots of some species in mature groves in tropical climates have actually been clocked growing 4 feet in one 24-hour period! As a young plant's rhizome system expands, its ability increases to produce larger, taller, and more numerous culms. Thus, each year's crop of shoots is larger than the last, until the mature size for the species is reached and new culms continue to come up at the mature size. This may take a number of years, depending on the size and age of the original planting, the species, and the growing conditions.\nIndividual culms and rhizomes only live an average of 5-10 years, and the culms grow no taller or bigger with age. That is why the older parts of the plant are frequently the smallest. Old or dead culms can be thinned out to make more light available for new growth.\nThe shooting period varies from species to species and genus to genus. In general, the temperate climate bamboos are runners, which shoot in the spring, while the tropical and sub-tropical varieties are clumpers, which shoot in the late summer and fall.\nThe size and appearance of any particular bamboo variety may vary significantly depending upon climate and conditions. Size alone is greatly affected by location, temperature, nutrition, water, and sun exposure.\nClumping and Running Bamboos\nThere are two main types of bamboo: Noninvasive clumping bamboos (sympodial or pachymorph) have short roots and form discrete clumps. There are also a few species of clumpers which have slightly longer roots (6-18\"), and we refer to these as open clumpers. Running bamboos (monopodial or leptomorph) are the ones that spread through the growth of long, horizontal roots, called rhizomes. With a little knowledge and proper materials, running bamboos and open clumpers can be effectively contained. The information in this catalog will enable you to grow beautiful, well-behaved bamboo.\nClumping bamboos have a very short root structure, are genetically incapable of expanding more than few inches a year, and will generally form discrete circular clumps. The clumps slowly enlarge as new culms emerge every year, but may ultimately need to expand to anywhere from a 3 to 10 ft. diameter (or more, especially for taller types) in order to reach their mature height, depending on species. The dense root system can exert strong pressure on structures in contact with it, and thus clumpers should be planted at some distance from fences, sidewalks, retaining walls, etc. Clumpers make excellent specimen plants and will also form very dense screens, but more slowly than runners. Except for the Fargesias, clumpers tend to be less cold-hardy than runners.\nRunning bamboos spread variously, sending out underground runners (rhizomes) which sometimes range far from the parent plant. Runners fill in the spaces between plantings faster, making them ideal for fast screens, hedges, and the popular open grove look. Bamboo runners may be easily contained, since the rhizomes grow sideways at a depth of only about 2-18 inches. Most are also very cold-hardy.\nRUNNERS VS CLUMPERS - CHOOSING THE BEST TYPE FOR YOUR NEEDS:\nWe provide here some tips and criteria for choosing between runners and clumpers for a given purpose or planting location. These are very general guidelines and there can always be exceptions, depending on the situation.\nRunners are recommended for:\nFast privacy screens with quick fill-in, in narrower spaces than clumpers.\nGreatest height in the SF Bay Area \u0096 some species grow up to 50 ft. In more tropical climates, some giant timbers may reach 60-70 ft.\nLarge open groves.\nGround covers and erosion control.\nContainer planting.\nLess expensive plants (but may require root barrier installation).\nGreater variety of species to choose from.\nRunners are not recommended for:\nSituations where barrier installation is desirable but problematic (e.g. tree roots or on steep slopes)\nWhere fear of invasiveness is insurmountable.\nClumpers are recommended for:\nDense screens (but slower to fill in).\nHeight: Maximum SF Bay Area height is 40 ft. in some locations, but 30 ft. on average. Some of our giant timber clumpers may grow up to 55 ft. in tropical climates.\nSpecimen plants and ornamental accents.\nWherever spreading is undesirable, and root barrier installation is too expensive or difficult (e.g. tree roots or on steep slopes).\nLarge, wide planting spaces or containers. Clumpers may require anywhere from a 3-10 ft. diameter circular space, or more, in order reach their mature height, depending on species.\nClumpers are not recommended for (again, these are very general guidelines and there can always be exceptions, depending on the situation):\nFor fastest screens or fill-in. (They do gain height rapidly, however).\nNarrow planting beds or small or narrow containers, especially ceramic ones which can be broken by root pressure. Clumpers cannot easily adjust their circular shape to a long, narrow space, and height of culms may be limited if too small a space is allowed for the roots. Annual thinning can extend the length of time a clumper can grow in a small, contained space, however.\nCold winter areas which receive lots of frost or temperatures below 20 degrees F. (except the Fargesias, which are hardy to -20 degrees).\nFor wide choice of species. There are fewer clumping species to choose from for any given micro climate or sun exposure, but there are some clumpers appropriate for almost every area. About 1/3 of the bamboo species are clumpers.\nPlease see Containment of Bamboo for a complete explanation of methods of containment. And see our Price List for the many available clumping bamboos (designated by the code \"C\"), open clumpers (\"O\"), and running bamboos (\"R\") that we offer.\nContainment of Bamboo\nRunners: Runners should generally be contained if on a property line or in a small yard, even if bordered by surface structures such as brick or cement patio, cement sidewalk or driveway, or shallow walls. The safest methods for containing running bamboos are:\n1) Planting in containers Click the following link for details in a printable Microsoft Word document: Bamboo in Planters and Containers - Do's, Don'ts and Special Maintenance Considerations .\n2) Installing high-density polyethylene plastic rhizome barrier, 40-60 mil thick and 22-34 inches deep, vertically around the perimeter of the area in which the bamboo is to be contained. This material is thicker than a credit card and comes on a 300 ft. roll in different widths, 24\" x 40 mil , 30\" x 40 mil , 30\" x 60 mil , and 36\" x 60 mil . It can be cut to any length and installed in any shape desired. Even large plantings of bamboo can be surrounded with a single length of plastic, requiring only one seam. The polyethylene is superior to cement and metal (cement often develops cracks, and metal rusts and requires many seams), is less expensive, and can last 20-30 years when installed according to our barrier installation instructions . We typically recommend using the 30\" barrier for most plants in the Phyllostachys genus.\nNote: When planting along a fenceline, if there is sufficient space it is advisable to leave an 18-24 inch corridor between the fence and the bamboo barrier to allow a space for maintenance along the back side of the planting area. Also, when planting on very steep slopes or planting very large giant timber runners in soft, sandy soil, it may be necessary to use a 36\" deep root barrier.\nLess defined ways to contain runners are:\n3) Water only the area in which the plants are wanted and nowhere else within 10 to 20 feet (in climates that have several dry months). Dry soils are a barrier to root growth. Spreading rhizomes require moisture and grow primarily during the warm summer months when most of the western states are dry. Cutting off new shoots coming up wherever they\u0092re not wanted complements and completes this method.\n4) A water-filled stream or ditch can also effectively contain the spread of bamboo, since rhizomes and roots cannot tolerate extended periods of saturation. Water need only be present for one season a year.\nIn some situations it is easiest to wait and see if there is going to be a problem before implementing containment measures. Many species require 3 years of growth before they begin to spread. Some running bamboos behave as clumpers under certain circumstances, such as lack of exposure to sun or very cold winter temperatures. On a large property where invasion of neighboring land or other parts of a garden are not issues, one may simply let the rhizomes go where they wish and remove new cane shoots by breaking them off if they emerge in any areas where canes are not desired. The tender shoots of larger species may also be harvested for food when just breaking ground. Since the rhizomes generally grow quite shallow, usually within the top 12 inches of soil, roots may also be curbed annually by cutting with a shovel and pulling them out while still young. The hazards of bamboo cultivation are often overstated.\nWith a certain amount of muscle power and the necessary tools, removal of bamboo IS possible. We also occasionally remove unwanted bamboo free of charge upon request, if we have time and have a use for it. If further advice or clarification is needed, please call Bamboo Sourcery.\nClumpers\nWith clumpers, it is not necessary or effective to surround the plant with a plastic root barrier. However, when selecting clumpers and planning the space, one must keep in mind that the root ball of a clumper must be allowed to reach a certain size in order to grow culms of a mature height. The circular space required may vary from 3 to 10 ft. in diameter, or more, depending on size of species. Clumpers cannot adjust their circular shape to a long, narrow space, and height of culms may be limited if too small a space is allowed for the roots.\nIn addition, clumpers may be shaped and prevented from putting pressure on any surrounding structures (such as a fence or sidewalk) by removing new shoots at soil level when they begin to encroach more closely on those structures. It is advisable to plant a clumping bamboo 2-4 ft. from a fence to allow some room for growth, top spread, and space for maintenance between the bamboo and the fence.\nFor more information about \"Runners vs Clumpers: Choosing the Best Type for your Needs,\" please see Clumping and Running Bamboos .\nFlowering of Bamboos\nOne of the mysteries of bamboo is how some species are able to flower periodically all over the world at the same time. This is called \u0093gregarious flowering.\u0094 This was the case with Phyllostachys bambusoides when it flowered during the 1970's, as it has done every 120 years through recorded bamboo history. Being an important timber variety, records of its flowering go back many centuries. To our knowledge, no one knows what triggers the flowering. While the flowering of some bamboos is periodic, others seem to be triggered by environmental conditions such as drought or stress. We do not sell plants that we know to be going into \"gregarious flowering\" stage, however we also do not have records adequate to predict when most species will flower. Flowering of the individual plant may continue for 2 to 7 years and is often fatal, but with extra care and feeding, the mother plant may survive and just be smaller. In addition, the numerous seeds may be planted and will reproduce the mother plant identically or produce new and interesting variations. By the time the mother plant finishes flowering, you may already have new seedlings well on their way!\nBamboos belong to the grass family, and their flowers look a lot like the flowers of other grasses, usually nothing spectacular, but quite varied. Traditionally, botanists describe species on the basis of their flowers. Because the flowering interval of some bamboo species is so long, botanists in the field often have difficulty finding flowers and defining species on that basis. This sometimes results in multiple names for the same plant and a great deal of confusion. Promising genetic research and international cooperation should help clarify the situation.\nHow and When to Plant\nThere are no hard and fast rules about planting bamboo. But we offer the following guidelines:\nBamboos grow best in rich, moist, well-drained soils. Often the addition of compost or other additives is beneficial (see section below). Place the plant at approximately the same soil level as it is in the pot, in a hole somewhat larger than the pot. After filling in around the plant, pack the soil firmly to eliminate air bubbles and soak thoroughly. Through the first year, make sure the plant remains moist but not waterlogged. Do not fertilize for the first 6 months. Plants have been fertilized at the nursery, and additional fertilizer at this point could shock the plant.\nThe best time to plant varies from area to area and species to species. In cold winter climates the best planting time is in the spring when likelihood of frost is past and when the ground can be worked. Bamboos do not develop their full cold-hardiness until well established, and planting in spring gives the plant a longer growing season to get established and develop its cold-hardiness before the next cold season. If planting in the late summer, we recommend planting even the most cold-hardy bamboos at least 3 months before first frost (although planting season may be somewhat extended by using frost covers). Thick mulch is recommended to protect the plants over the first winter regardless of when planted.\nIn very hot summer climates , the best planting times for bamboos are early spring and late fall. Bamboos will more readily establish themselves when weather is milder and rain is more likely. Mid-summer planting can sometimes be accomplished by using shade cloth to protect from intense sun.\nIn mild climate areas such as coastal California, it doesn\u0092t make as much difference, except for the least cold hardy clumpers, for which spring is still the best. Here every season has its advantages, with spring and summer offering the most active growing periods and fall, winter and spring sharing the rainy season.\nSite and Soil Preparation\nMost bamboos grow best in deep, well-drained, fertile soils, and they generally prefer neutral to slightly acid soils. If your soil is deficient, the extra time and expense of improving it is usually well worth the effort.\nSandy soils and alkaline soils may be improved with the addition of organic materials such as compost, peat, manures, nitrolized sawdust, or bark chips. These materials help retain moisture, acidify the soil, and also provide nutrition to the plants. Acid fertilizers can also be added to compensate for extremely alkaline soils. For overly acidic soils with pH of 5.5 or lower, add lime to reduce acidity to a pH of 6.0 - 7.0. Clay soils may be improved to provide better drainage with the addition of sand and organic materials. Most bamboos suffer root damage if submerged in water for several weeks. Drainage may also be improved by mounding the soil or ditching around the planting. Bamboos can be grown well in very shallow soils if adequate fertility and moisture are maintained. It\u0092s always a good idea to consult with your local nurseryman about how best to amend your local soils. (Note: If you have gophers in your area, be sure to read the section on Pests before planting).\nPotting Mixes\nIf you plan to grow your bamboo in containers, make sure to use a good potting mix. Most commercial potting or nursery mixes are adequate as they are.\nThe soil you use should both drain well and retain moisture. Most mixes contain both organic and inorganic elements. Sand, volcanic cinders, and perlite are excellent stable inorganic components. Sand has the virtue of being cheap, while cinders and perlite not only promote good drainage but also hold water. Fir bark, compost, and peat are good organic components. In general, larger organic particles last longer before breaking down; therefore, drainage improves with larger particles, decreases with smaller ones. It may also be advantageous to add a small proportion of loam or clay for micro-nutrients. In a potting mix one basically looks for texture rather than nutrition, however. Nutrition is easy to supplement.\nRepotting every third year is often helpful to keep the plant growing vigorously and looking its best. One may either repot it into a larger pot or divide the plant with a saw or hatchet. Annual pruning of old and dead wood will also improve the appearance and health of the plant.\nFertilizers for Bamboo\nBamboo in the Ground\nMar-Sep: Turf Supreme Fertilizer, 16-6-8. High in nitrogen to keep leaves green. Use one cup per 64 sq. feet (8 oz per 8' x 8'area), applied once a month.\nOct-Feb: Apex Fertilizer, 6-24-24. For greater growth of roots and shoots. Use two cups per 64 sq. ft. (8 oz per 8' x 8' area), applied every 6 weeks.\nAfter plants in the ground reach the desired height & density, maintain with 16-6-8 twice a year in March & June.\nAlso highly recommended for plants in the ground is composted horse manure, which is the bamboo fertilizer of choice in Asia. Every other year we spread it about 4\" deep in late fall to allow time for nitrogen conversion and use the rest of the year. For exceptionally tall growth, two applications per year may be used (early spring and late fall). During manure application years, additional chemical fertilizers are unnecessary. Use other manures if you have them available, but avoid nitrogen-hot ones, such as chicken and steer manure.\nBamboo in Containers\nYear-Round, Indoors or Outdoors: Apex or Osmocote Fertilizer, 14-14-14 or 16-16-16, four to six month slow-release. Apply the following amounts once every four to six months:\n1-gallon planter - 1 Tbsp\n"}, {"score": 664.54156, "uuid": "f2d0be15-7976-5a6c-8cbf-5aa57ec985fa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-44-30054", "target_hostname": "www.homemakers.com", "target_uri": "http://www.homemakers.com/blog/ecologic/category/plastic-packaging/", "page_rank": 2.7343887e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Plastic</em> packaging \u2013 Eco logic - Environmentally friendly advice and green", "snippet": "I\u2019ve done a little research on your behalf to clarify <em>which</em> are safe <em>plastics</em> and <em>which</em> are best avoided.

Make my own cuppa. I often make my own tea at work, but I\u2019m going to do this all the time so I don\u2019t end up with a paper cup. I\u2019ve also brought in a jar of granulated maple sugar from Gibbons Family Farm near Frankville in Eastern Ontario. No more paper sugar packets!\nMake it fun: I like to splurge on fair trade, organic tea in delicious flavours!\n3. Drive OR carpool to work every day. Once in a while I end up driving by myself. I\u2019m trying to avoid that, since I have transit and carpool options.\nMake it fun: Walking is a healthier way to get there; whenever I make time to walk, I always see interesting things on my journey. I\u2019ll try to build in some time to walk to my appointments, even if I\u2019m just getting off the subway a stop earlier.\n4. Commit to my butcher. My partner and I eat vegetarian several nights a week, but we are meat eaters. I believe it\u2019s possible to do so sustainably, but it means ensuring that the animals were raised locally on smaller-scale farms, and it means eating beef and pork less often than fowl. I\u2019ve found an environmentally minded butcher on my transit route home from work.\nMake it fun: My butcher often has interesting marinades and spice blends I don\u2019t use at home, so I\u2019ll give them a whirl!\n5. Review my investments. I don\u2019t do a lot of investing \u2013 right now I\u2019m focusing on paying off my mortgage \u2013 but I will make time to review the holdings of the funds I have to ensure I don\u2019t own any mining and mineral stocks, nor any companies I suspect are eco offenders.\nMake it fun: Well, I\u2019m not really sure how to make this one fun, but I\u2019ll get a sense of satisfaction knowing that I\u2019m not investing in environmental exploitation!\nWhat do you think? Which of our common habits is hardest on the environment, and how can we do better?\n"}, {"score": 650.5673, "uuid": "372a602c-d577-5bc6-bb23-feaf14c9777f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1608wb-60-12906", "target_hostname": "behnkes.com", "target_uri": "http://behnkes.com/website/gardening-articles/landscaping-a-design/467-all-about-gardening-in-containers.html", "page_rank": 1.1763829e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "All about Gardening <em>in</em> Containers", "snippet": "And containers are portable, so we can move <em>plants</em> around the garden <em>or</em> even indoors for the winter, especially with the help <em>of</em> <em>plant</em> dollies.

And containers are portable, so we can move plants around the garden or even indoors for the winter, especially with the help of plant dollies.\nThe Container\nTypes are detailed below but there\u2019s one thing they all have in common: the bigger, the better for the health of the plants. Sources recommend containers that are as wide as they are tall for stability and for good insulation of roots.\nPlastic pots are inexpensive and are slow to dry out, which is an advantage with most plants, but a disadvantage for plants that need \u201cgood drainage\u201d \u2014 like lavender or these sedums. And definitely on the negative side, they look cheap.\nTerra cotta pots look better, but are a lot heavier, and most won\u2019t withstand the freeze-and-thaw cycles of winter. They clearly provide better drainage than plastic, though.\nGlazed ceramic pots look great but need more drainage holes, and again if you live where winters include freezing temps, make sure they\u2019re hardy before you buy it, unless you\u2019ll be bringing them indoors.\nCheap wood can and will rot; redwood and cedar will last longer. There are concerns about wooden containers that have been treated \u2014 fear that the vapors can damage plants, and here\u2019s some information about treated wood and plants .\nThese days a very popular alternative are the lightweight fiberglass and resin planters that mimic real stone, terra cotta, or concrete. In the photo above, most of the planters are fiberglass and they cost about $60 each.\nHanging baskets are often lined with sphagnum moss to better hold water. Still, it\u2019s hard to water often enough if the basket is hung in the hot afternoon sun. Hanging plants require a special commitment on the part of their caretaker.\nLandscape Designer Michelle Derviss suggests choosing containers that match the color or style of the house.\nDesign\nOn GardenRant Elizabeth asked the design question: To mix plants within one pot or not? and got some great responses. The debate is between plantings of mixed plants or filling each pot with lots of only one particular plant.\nGinny Stibolt suggests choosing plants for three levels: \u201cthe tall or spiky plant, the bushy medium height plant, and the vining or trailing plant that will hang gracefully from the sides. Work with odd numbers of plants, and maybe add a nice rock or art object to enhance the arrangement. You can accomplish these arrangements in one large, stand-alone container or by using several containers of different sorts with a variety of plants. Mostly I\u2019ve had better luck with single species pots.\u201d This three-layer idea is practically universal (certainly in Japanese flower arranging) and Fine Gardening Magazine coined the terms \u201cThrillers, Spillers and Fillers\u201d for them.\nDon Engebretson, the Renegade Gardener , writes: \u201cPlants grown in pots and other containers open up a whole new dimension of design possibilities. One of the best gardeners I know plants coleus in12\u2033-tall pots in the spring, then places the pots strategically throughout one of her numerous flower beds. By July the perennials and annuals rising from the earth completely hide the pots; all one sees are these great plumes of coleus bursting up 18\u2033 to 20\u2033 above the ground and one thinks, wow, can she ever grow coleus!\u201d\nDon recommends just one pot of flowers or cluster of pots to one side of the front door rather than pots evenly matched on both sides. And he likes oddness: \u201cThe odd-numbered arrangement will always look better than two or four or six pots together. No one knows why.\u201d\nThe Potting Medium\nThese days, soil-less potting \u201cmedia\u201d are popular \u2014 all bagged up at the hardware store or garden center. But Ginny thinks they\u2019re fine for annuals but for potted-up plants that will be staying in place longer than a year she recommends \u201cadding some compost in the soil mix and as an occasional topdressing because all those good microbes create a better environment for the roots.\u201d She uses half compost and half sandy soil for her pots, with a sterile potting medium only for the top two inches and mulch on top of that to prevent weeds. Sounds good to me.\nThose soil-less mixtures have the advantage of being lightweight, well-draining and disease-free, but DO need all their nutrients provided by you, don\u2019t forget. In any event, don\u2019t use regular garden soil \u2014 it\u2019s heavy, not as freely draining (which is of supreme importance in containers) and it may come with pests.\nNow what about using those \u201cwater-saving crystals\u201d or hydrogels we see in the stores? Well, garden writers discussed this at length via email and one of them summed it up nicely here on her blog . The bottom line? \u201cJust say no\u201d to them.\nWhat about covering the drainage hole?\nIt\u2019s practically gardening tradition to cover drainage holes with broken terra cotta chards or an inch of gravel, but respected horticultural authority Linda Chalker-Scott says studies have shown that the practice actually impedes drainage - because water does not travel well from the potting mix to the coarse gravel mixture. Plus, plant roots need all the soil they can get.\nTo prevent soil from washing out of the drainage holes, place a piece of weed barrier cloth, or even a few dried leaves or several layers of newspaper over the holes before adding the soil. Ginny again suggests using \u201ca large piece of the non-woven weed barrier cloth so it extends up the sides of the pot, it can also discourage ants from using your outdoor pots for nests.\u201d\nPlanting\nFill the container with the growing medium to within one inch from the rim \u2014 to leave room for watering without water spilling over the side. Then give it a good soaking before planting. Insert plants so they meet the soil again about an inch from the pot\u2019s rim and add or remove soil so that the soil surface is smooth and also an inch below the rim. Then add a half-inch of mulch to preserve moisture, prevent weeds and most obviously, to keep soil from splashing up onto your plants \u2014 ugh. What to use? Pebbles can bake the plants, which is fine for succulents. Otherwise use a mulch that cools, like bark chips or my favorite, shredded pine bark.\nWatering\nIf they\u2019re sitting in the midday or afternoon sun, most pots need watering daily, if not more often. Automatic watering systems can work like a dream, I\u2019m told. I recently saw one that snaked up the posts of a deck to automatically water all the pots on the deck. I could use one of those myself.\nFeeding\nSome experts recommend including fertilizer with every other watering, which seems like a lot. I agree with the other experts who suggest every two or three weeks. It\u2019s best to use an organic fertilizer that\u2019s diluted in water, like fish emulsion and liquid seaweed.\nChoosing plants\nAs a general rule always pick plants that are hardier to colder winters than where you live because soil that\u2019s aboveground gets colder. So, for example, in my Zone 7a garden I choose plants hardy to Zone 5 or colder for pot. (Most of my in-ground plants are a zone or two hardier than technically required, too, but when plants are in pots it\u2019s mandatory.) Then take note of a plant\u2019s watering requirements and ask yourself if you\u2019ll really be watchful about watering daily, for instance. Next, how much sun ya got?\nPlants for Containers in the Sun\nMy favorite perennial for pots in the sun you already know \u2014 sedums of all types. I also love grasses with trailing plants, the photo right being a stunning example of combination.\nThe best-looking shrub-in-a-pot I\u2019ve grown is that most malleable of shrubs, the acuba. More recommendations coming here soon.\nI\u2019ve tried some trees in pots, Korean and Bosnian pines, and a couple of short junipers, but one of the pines quickly outgrew its pot and the other one I feared wouldn\u2019t last long, so I\u2019ve moved them both to the garden. Why wouldn\u2019t they last long, you ask? When their roots expand outward enough to contact the pot itself, those freeze-and-thaw cycles are murder on them. Paul James confirmed the short-lived nature of most trees in pots recently, as did a nurseryman specializing in conifers, when questioned by me at a trade show. One possible solution I\u2019ve seen suggested is to line the inside of the pot with a thin layer of packing wrap, which will expand and contract against the side of the pot \u2014 or at least that\u2019s the idea. (See more about wintering over below.)\nGot a deck you\u2019d like to enliven with flowering vines? Containers are the way to go, there being no open ground on your deck, and here\u2019s what the National Arboretum\u2019s Scott Aker suggests:\nTrumpet vine (Campus radicans), because it attracts hummingbirds and is native to this region, though he considers the Chinese version, Campsis grandiflora, even nicer. C. grandiflora \u2018Morning Calm\u2019 is commonly available and is compact, with larger flowers than most trumpet vines. Its flowers are a mix of peach, pastel orange and light yellow.\nHe also recommends large containers \u2014 a cubic yard of potting soil to support enough vine to at least partially cover a pergola, for example. If a container that size looks bad on the deck, maybe it can be put on the ground (as in this photo) and the vines trained up and over the structure you\u2019re trying to cover.\nAnd asked about clematis, Aker warns that they really \u201cresent\u201d hot weather and he\u2019s seen them grown successfully rarely, and only when given some protection from the sun.\nPlants for Shade or Partial Sun\nI have lots of plant suggestions here, thanks to Joel Lerner in the Washington Post. For something you can leave outdoors all year he suggests trees, either deciduous or evergreen, plus some perennials or annuals for color \u2014 and all but the annuals will winter over.\nFor woody plants, he suggests: Japanese maple , Kousa dogwood, \u2018Little Henry\u2019 Virginia sweetspire, \u2018Emerald\u2019 arborvitae, \u2018Hetz Midget\u2019 arborvitae, dwarf falsecypress \u2018Nana Gracilis,\u2019 golden variegated euonymus (E. japonicus \u2018Aureomarginatus\u2019) and wintergreen boxwood.\nLerner suggests these perennials for pots in the shade : Rhodea, hellebore, astilbe, Japanese painted fern, evergreen wood fern, bleeding heart \u2018Luxuriant\u2019, hosta, columbine, cardinal flower, hardy begonia, and woodland phlox.\nAnd his favorite annuals for pots are: coleus, impatiens, Joseph\u2019s coat, caladium, peacock ginger, elephant ear, rex and tuberous begonias, and bacopa.\nWhat about Winter?\nFirst, will your plants survive winter? (I\u2019ll repeat here: they\u2019d better be hardy to at least one zone colder than where you live.) Many gardeners bring their pots indoors for the winter, preferably to a basement or garage that stays between 40 and 60 degrees F. (But who has that? My garage gets too cold and my basement stays too warm.) Root cellars may be best but again, who has that?) If potted plants are tropical they can usually be brought indoors to winter over as houseplants, assuming you cut way back on the watering and give them the right type and amount of sun.\nOr you can do what\u2019s frequently suggested \u2014 leave your not-hardy-enough plants outdoors but wrap them up in burlap or bubble wrap or something equally unattractive. I find it easy to say no thanks to that idea.\nAnd check this site for some great-looking winter container ideas.\n"}, {"score": 640.10474, "uuid": "0df696db-4c15-5e41-862f-77e2d06ca3b2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401wb-39-08095", "target_hostname": "www.acs.edu.au", "target_uri": "http://www.acs.edu.au/courses/certificate-in-horticulture-herbs-163.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1784921e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>or</em> job", "snippet": "Pyrethrum <em>is</em> a commercially grown herb.

Distillation involves boiling a solution of the herb so that the oil vaporises with steam. As the vapour cools, the steam (ie: water gas) and the oil vapour will turn into liquid at different temperatures. By collecting the oil when it turns back into liquid but not collecting the steam, the two can be separated and the herb oil extracted.\nPure herb oils prepared by distillation can be purchased from craft shops or some herb nurseries.\nUSING NON AROMATIC OILS\nA simpler way to create herb oils is by using non aromatic oils (eg: Olive oil or Safflower oil). These are oils that have no real odour.\nHerbs can be mixed with non aromatic oils and allowed to stand for a period of weeks (or more).\nThe oils in the herb will to some degree penetrate the non aromatic oil giving a mixture of non aromatic oil and the herb's scents/flavour. This type of oil is weaker than that extracted by distillation, but it can still be used in much the same way as the pure herb oil can.\nOTHER METHODS\n1. Place petals from scented flowers such as Jasmine or Rose in a clean ceramic container and pour water over the top. After some weeks or months oil will appear as a filmy scum on the surface of the water. You can then use a piece of cotton wool to carefully absorb the oilfrom the surface of the water. The oil can then be squeezed out of the cotton wool. This is a delicate procedure which will work, but is tedious and only yeilds small quantities of oil.\u00a0 Store in small glass vials.\n2. To extract oils from fragrant woods such as cedar, sandlewood, sassafras, camphor laurel etc. Reduce the wood to shavings using a wood plane for tough woods, or garden shredder for softer woods. From there extract the oil using one of the methods outlined above.\nExams: There are four exams for the course; one after lesson 7, another after lesson 15; a third after lesson 22 and the final at the conclusion of the course.\nFrom our Principal:\n"}], [{"score": 639.70483, "uuid": "421fc2f7-c974-5689-a814-503905f27099", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400wb-37-04563", "target_hostname": "www.acs.edu.au", "target_uri": "http://www.acs.edu.au/info/gardening-news/home-gardeners/hydroponics.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1929571e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "What <em>is</em> Hydroponics", "snippet": "These can be manual <em>or</em> automatic, choice <em>of</em> media <em>in</em> the box Example <em>of</em> how they work: A box (often polystyree similar to what <em>is</em> used <em>in</em> a fruit shop), with a reservoir <em>of</em> nutrient solution <em>in</em> the bottom.

It can be used just about anywhere, but it's particularly suitable for small gardens, for greenhouses, or for elderly or handicapped people. Systems can be simple and inexpensive, costing from less than $50 to set up: or complex, highly automated, much more expensive systems requiring little labour to operate. Hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of horticulture today, not only amongst hobby gardeners, but also in it's use for commercial growing of cut flowers, berries and some vegetables.\nHydroponic gardens are container gardens with a difference. Unlike the normal container garden, the pots are not filled with potting soil, or anything else containing nutrients.\nHydroponic containers are filled with things which contain virtually no nutrients at all such as coarse sand, perlite, rockwool (a fibrous insulation like material) or even just water and air. Plant roots in fact can be grown in these containers, with moisture and nutrients being supplied in a very controlled way, as and when they are needed.\nHydroponics Courses click here\nHydroponic gardens start out life with a few advantages over a soil garden. They are normally free of pests and diseases, and free of any excessive levels of toxins around the roots. The oxygen and water levels around the roots can be modified to an ideal level, and there are usually no weed seeds to contend with. If the system is maintained and run properly, all of these advantages remain in tact, but if neglected, these advantages can soon, one by one, disappear.\nLearn the basic of gardening or horticulture with a mini course.

PVC pipe or guttering). Plant roots dangle in the flowing water and air, while the plant tops are supported above (eg. tied to trellis, ot sitting on a platform of plastic mesh). The channels are sometimes filled with coarse sand or stones, but water absorbing material such as perlite should be avoided, as it can cause root rots.\nSuitable plants to grow in NFT: Tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, beans, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, chicory, corn, eggplant, capsicum, okra, herbs, spinich, strawberry, pepino, snapdragon, stock, chrysanthemum. Channels filled with nonabsorbant plastic beads have been very good for propagating cuttings.\nUnsuitable plants: Bulbs, roses, indoor plants\nPossible problems: A power failure can stop the flow of solution and result in plant death very quickly. If the series of channels are not calculated properly, some plants can end up with more or less nutrient and water than others. Solution which is exposed to light can grow green slime (ie.algae). This may not harm the plants, but it can clog up the pipes and affect flow of nutrient solution.\nGravel Bed Systems\nThese are a raised bed or boxed structure is filled with a coarse sand or stone (eg. Aquarium sand, washed granitic sand, blue metal chips or scoria stone). Nutrient solution can be applied various ways:\nflooding then draining off the excess.\nby a drip irrigation system.\ncollecting and reusing the excess or allowing it to be lost (run to waste).\nSuitable plants to grow: Jerusalem artichoke, Asparagus, Garlic, Leek, Lettuce, Melons, Onions, Potato, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Pea, Radish, Tomato, Strawberry, Herbs, cut flower Bulbs, Carnation, Chrysanthemum, Pineapple,\nUnsuitable plants: Root vegetables such as carrots and parsnips are more difficult.\nPossible problems: If the media used is poorly drained, root rots can occur. Avoid too much vermiculite in any mix. Irrigations should not be too frequent in cool weather. (Gravel beds in Melbourne may only need winter irrigations every 1 to 4 weeks)\nRockwool slabs\nRockwool is an absorbant sponge like material, made by spinning molten rock into fine fibres. It is very light weight being made up of more than 95% air space, and having the ability to absorb and hold more nutrient solution than other materials, while still also retaining lots of air around the roots. Seeds or cuttings can be started in rockwool, and the roots simply grow amongst the fibres. Nutrient solution can be applied simply with a watering can, or through a drip irrigation system. Overwatering is almost impossible.\nSuitable plants to grow: Jerusalem artichoke, Lettuce, Melons, Onions, Capsicum, Cucumber, Eggplant, Zucchini, Pumpkin, Tomato , Strawberry, Carnations, Chrysanthemum, Rose, Gerbera.\nUnsuitable plants: Root crops\nPossible problems: Large plants become top heavy and need trellising. Algae can grow on the rockwool surface, then die leaving a water resistant coating on the surface (avoid by keeping as much of the surface as possible protected from light; done by using wrapped slabs.\nRockwool slabs are generally not reusable.\nPerlite Grobags\nCommercial kits are available\nPerlite in a non transparent bag, usually plastic. After wetting perlite with nutrient solution, plants can be planted direct into the media. Nutrient is applied usually through a drip irrigation system, but can also be applied manually.\nSuitable plants to grow: Globe or Jerusalem artichoke, Leek, Lettuce, Tomato, Capsicum, Cucumber, Gerbera, Carnations, Chrysanthemum, most other crop plants can be grown successfully in a home situation.\nUnsuitable plants: Root crops.\nPossible problems: Perlite can be dusty, but wetting before use can minimize this.\nAlgae can grow on surfaces exposed to light. Sprinkle coarse sand on any exposed surfaces to stop.\nAeroponic Systems\nPlants are supported on something like a platform or grid, with roots dangling through openings into an enclosed chamber below. Nutrient solution is periodically sprayed in the chamber to fertilize and water. Being enclosed in a chamber the humidity always remains high around the roots, preventing drying out.\nSuitable plants to grow: Lettuce, tomato, parsley, silver beet, celery, cabbage, beans, strawberries, melons, cucumbers.\nUnsuitable plants: Root vegetables\nPossible problems: If pumps break down, roots dry out very fast\nCapillary fed pots\nWater and nutrients are drawn by capillary action from an outer well (eg. bucket) which is topped up as required. Example: Terracotta pot filled with gravel stood inside a bucket containing nutrient solution.\nSuitable plants to grow: Many indoor plants (eg. African violet, Aphelandra, Diffenbachia, Dracaena, Ficus, Ferns, Palms etc)\nPossible problems: Root rot if level of nutrient solution is kept too high, particularly in cooler weather. Allowing nutrient solution to drop too low in hot weather.\nCapillary Fed Boxes\nCommercial kits are often available.\nThese can be manual or automatic, choice of media in the box\nExample of how they work: A box (often polystyree similar to what is used in a fruit shop), with a reservoir of nutrient solution in the bottom. Solution soaks up into water absorbent material which plants grow in.\nSuitable plants to grow: most.\nUnsuitable plants: root crops\nPossible problems: Too much solution causes root rot. Some media (eg. perlite or vermiculite) can grow algae on surface.\nBeing a closed system, salt residues can build up (you can see this as a white cake on the surface of the media).\nNUTRIENTS:\nNutrients are one of the most confusing aspects of hydroponic culture. There are so many to choose from, and then you could even decide to make your own. For the commercial grower, the choice of what to use can be critical. For the hobbyist though, who is using the one standard nutrient and growing a variety of different plants, any \"general\" properly formulated nutrient will probably work as well as another.\nTo achieve the ultimate with hydroponics, you need to recognize that every plant variety has different needs at each and every stage of their growth. You can cater to these needs when you grow an acre of the one crop, but if you're growing three tomato plants, six strawberries and a dozen lettuce all in the one system, you must compromise and use a fertilizer which is generally acceptable to all three plants.\nWHERE TO PUT A HYDROPONIC SYSTEM\nRemember plants are no different in hydroponics than in soil when considering needs for light, temperature, pest control, ventilation, etc. Many people grow hydroponic gardens in small courtyards, or otherwise unused places such as along the narrow side of a house. Hydroponics can be a great, space saving way to make use of such areas; but if these areas are poorly ventilated, or are dark, then that can restrict what can be grown there.\nHydroponic beds or channels can be mounted on a wall, or set above paving, or even set up on a timber verandah. They are ideal in a greenhouse or a well lit shed, perhaps under a skylight. Many types of systems are able to be moved if you want to change the garden around, and some can even be put on wheels to allow you to move them to a better part of the garden in different seasons.\nHYDROPONIC TERMINOLOGY\nSolid Media - inert material which the plant roots grow amongst (eg. sand, perlite, rock wool, scoria, ceramic chips etc).\nAutomatic System - where nutrient solution is applied under water pressure automatically, using some form of irrigation system (eg. pumps)\nManual System - where nutrient solution is applied manually (eg. by lifting a container of nutrient solution above the plants and allowing gravity to apply the solution, or using capillary action, whereby the solution soaks up into the media from below the plants, via absorbent material)\nNutrient Solution - a carefully balanced mixture of nutrient fertilizers and water, which will give the plant all the nutrition it needs in the most appropriate concentration for the plants being grown.\nRun to waste - where any excess nutrient is drained out of the system and lost (ie. wasted). Also called an Open System.\nClosed System - where waste products cannot escape. The system is totally closed to the outside.\nMore Information\nOnline Courses in Gardening, Landscaping and more www.acseduonline.com\nMail Order Books and Videos on gardening, landscaping and more www.acsbookshop.com\nArticles, Courses and Information www.acsgarden.com\nGardening Photos for Inspiration http://www.webphotos.com.au/photo_cats.aspx\nSubscribe to the ACS Newsletter\nSubscribe for Special Offers, New Services, Courses, Books, Opportunities, Free Stuff and more!\n"}, {"score": 623.30206, "uuid": "06cc1241-8d45-502d-9c57-5fcddfeba9ab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1811wb-00-01754", "target_hostname": "www.bamboosourcery.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bamboosourcery.com/catalog.cfm", "page_rank": 1.1850012e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Bamboo <em>plants</em> for sale at our specialty nursery <em>in</em> Sebastopol, CA.", "snippet": "Also, because indoor environments are usually less than ideal, rotating your <em>plants</em> outdoors <em>in</em> mild conditions <em>is</em> often a wise practice for their long-<em>term</em> <em>health</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "3' x 3' planter - 1 Cup\nWatering of Bamboo\nFirst and foremost, keep your bamboo well watered. Bamboo likes plenty of deep watering - soaking down to at least 8-12 inches - and also good drainage. If you are keeping your plants in containers, or unable to transplant for a while, make sure the water is running out of the bottom of the pot each time you water. With ground plantings, a deep soaking less frequently is best, rather than a shallow watering every day. Then wait until the soil is just slightly damp - not wet, and not bone dry - before watering again. After the first few months, you can usually depend on a spray emitter irrigation system, using 2 to 4 high volume emitters per plant. (We do not recommend \"drip\" systems, as they do not emit a large enough volume of water and do not cover an area widely).\nYou will need to keep a close eye on your bamboo for a while to determine how much and how often to water in your particular microclimate, soil type and season. Occasionally, check moisture in the ground by digging down to a depth of at least 4 inches. If the soil is dry at 4 inches, water is not getting to the roots adequately. This is especially important during the first 2-3 months after transplanting. Also, as a rule of thumb, if the leaves are curling sideways (lengthwise) this means your bamboo is stressed and not getting enough water. If the leaves are drooping downward, your bamboo might be getting too much water and/or not enough drainage.\nAlso, in full sun, dry, windy or hot situations, it is ideal to spray the foliage with water once a day for an initial transition period of 2-4 weeks, and/or all summer in dry, hot climates. Regular overhead watering will reduce the amount of leaf drop during the transition, help your bamboo get established quickly, and increase its growth rate and ultimate height in dry climates.\nPossible Bamboo Pests\nBamboo doesn't have many pests, but the pests they do have can be unsightly, if not a serious problem, unless some simple steps are taken.\nGophers:\nIn northern California we have an abundance of gophers and squirrels, who think tender new rhizomes, bamboo shoots, and even new branch buds are a delicacy. To protect the rhizomes from gophers, the best solution is to plant inside of a \u00bc inch mesh metal gopher basket (which can be purchased). By the time the basket has rusted away, your bamboo is usually large and well established, and gophers cannot do enough damage to seriously harm your bamboo. If you find that new shoots or new branch buds are being chewed up by squirrels or gophers, painting on tabasco sauce is quite effective! (It may leave permanent stains on culms, however).\nInsects: Mites, Aphids, Mealy Bugs, Scale, & Ants:\nIt is much easier to keep mites out of your bamboo than it is to get rid of them once they have established themselves, and they can become a serious problem. Therefore, inspect any new bamboo you import into your garden. If mites are found, immediately separate the plants from other bamboos in your garden and clean thoroughly with a high-powered hose. See below for stronger measures, if required. Also, mites live in grass, so make an effort to keep grasses away from the base of your bamboo.\nThe symptoms of mites are small, regular, bleached-looking spots on the leaves. If you look very closely at the underside of the leaves, you will also see a very fine white web. The mites themselves are silvery grey and so small it is hard to see them without a magnifying glass. Often mites and aphids can be found together, and the treatment for both is the same.\nAphids are small crawling insects, either green or black in color. Mealy bugs appear usually in branch joints as little spots of \"white cotton\" which seem not to move at all. Scale looks like little, flat cones on branches and leaves, and are light colored when young, growing darker and more visible with age.\nAphids, mealy bugs and scale are sometimes accompanied by ants and/or sooty mold. These insects all produce a sticky secretion that can be eaten by ants, and sometimes a black sooty mold grows on it as well. So the presence of ants or sooty mold is often a sign of insect problems. The ants themselves do not harm the bamboo. Mealy bugs and scale are less of a problem in areas which receive hard frosts in winter.\nWith the interests of the environment in mind, below you will find our approaches to insect problems, with the most environmentally friendly listed first:\nIf you have a pressure washer, use it once every week or two on the bamboo. This can be very effective against mites and other insects, and will not harm the leaves.\nCreate an insecticidal soap made with Arm & Hammer laundry detergent (powder), using 1 tablespoon per 1 gal water in a sprayer. Apply no more than once every two weeks. It turns leaves somewhat yellow, but is our treatment of choice because of its high effectiveness and low toxicity to the environment.\nNiem Oil: organic insecticide which kills mites, aphids, mealy bugs, white flies, and other insects. Follow directions on bottle, including all safety precautions. (Other \"ultra-fine\" oils can also be used).\nIf the above are not sufficiently effective and you have a large area of infested bamboo, you might consider the following more toxic substances:\nMalathion: kills pretty much all insects. Follow directions on bottle, including all safety precautions.\nAvid: kills specifically only mites and leaf miners, no other insects or birds. Has some systemic action, which makes it more effective with mites. Very expensive and hard to find in retail stores. Follow directions on bottle, including all safety precautions.\nOther possible pests - Bamboo in the West is a deer-proof plant. We have lots of deer here in Northern California, specifically the western mule deer, but have never had a problem with them. However, if bamboo is the only fodder for miles around they might eat it, especially tender new plants, and in that case, deer fencing around your new bamboo plants is a good idea. In the eastern U.S., the white-tailed deer co-evolved with our one native American species of bamboo, Arundinaria gigantea, and developed a taste for bamboo; and therefore, deer fencing is more imperative in the eastern states.\nBamboo Plant Selection\nPurpose: In all its varied forms, the uses for bamboo are endless: striking, stand-alone specimen plants, a low variegated border, groundcover, accent plants in pots on a deck or patio, an interesting entryway, an Asian look for Japanese gardens, etc.\nBy far the most popular use of bamboo, however, is as fast-growing privacy screens and evergreen hedges. Since bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet, bamboo screens and hedges can be created more quickly and inexpensively, compared to other plants or trees. Running bamboos fill in the spaces between the original plants the fastest, and even with 3' ft. spacing some screening can be achieved within 2-3 years with smaller size pots. Clumping bamboos take more time to fill in, but are ultimately extremely dense. Bamboo Sourcery also sells bamboos that are 10-20 ft, even 30 ft. tall already which can be used for \"instant screens.\" Almost any species can be used for effective screening, given that it will grow to the height you desire in the space that you can allow for it, and given that it is properly matched to your climate and planting area for cold hardiness and sun/shade.\nWe discuss below the various factors involved in selecting the plants that will best suit your needs and your location from the myriad of bamboos available. Four of the characteristics listed below are also listed with each species on our Price List.\nTemperature: Cold-hardiness, the lowest temperature tolerated by the root system of each species for 2-3 nights at a time, is listed on our Price Lists for each plant. (We tend not to use zone systems, since there are so many different systems). It's best to select bamboos that will tolerate temperatures well below the lowest temperatures you've experienced in perhaps the last 10 years in order to ensure healthy plants long-term. The cold-hardiness rating generally represents the threshold for root death. Somewhat less cold temperatures may cause only leaf burn and the loss of some leaves. If the canes are not damaged, new leaves will bud out again when the weather warms up. Colder temperatures experienced for several nights may kill the tops or even whole canes, causing them to turn beige. The parts of canes which are dead will not produce new leaves and may be cut off. However, if the roots survive, they will produce new shoots (culms) in spring or summer. Cold-hardiness can be extended considerably by putting a very deep mulch over the bamboos in the fall.\nA few plants may also suffer from summer heat, such as Fargesias and some Chusqueas, which do not tolerate hot summer nights (over 70 F.).\nSun: Sun needs are listed on the Price Lists. Compare with the number of hours of direct sun which your plants will receive, and what part of the day they will be in sun. AM sun is cooler, but PM sun may be harsher, and is especially harsh in dry climates.\nHeight & Diameter: Maximum height and diameter reached by each species in the climate of origin is listed in the Price List. This is the \"known reference point.\" However, height and diameter are affected by all aspects of climate: high and low temperatures, sun/shade exposure, humidity/aridity, water supplied, length of growing season, etc. For example, many of the bamboos like humidity and warmth, which makes them taller and larger in diameter; but aridity and/or cooler winters will prevent some plants from reaching their maximum size. Certain plants, when grown in California, reach 50% of the height they achieve in the climate of origin.\nHowever, if your climate has hot, humid, long summers and stays well within the plant's cold tolerance, and if the plant is located in an appropriate amount of sun or shade and will have year-round water, you can generally expect the maximum height. Height in relation to climate is somewhat predictable for most of the species, so if in doubt, check with us about height for a species in your climate.\nRunning or clumping type: Listed on the Price Lists. Consider all of the advantages and disadvantages of clumpers and runners for you. For example, clumpers spread wide more slowly, but grow tall faster, and don\u0092t require root barrier for containment. Runners spread wide quickly to form screens, are less expensive, but sometimes require root barrier. For a more thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages and how to choose the best type for your situation, see the section Clumping and Running Bamboos .\nLook desired: There is an amazing variety in bamboos to choose from. There are canes with colors, stripes, large/small diameters, exposed or covered with foliage. Leaves may be striped and variegated, yellow or white with green, long and thin, large and wide, or very small. Growth habit may be vertical & narrow, bushy & wide, weeping, arching at the top, dense or airy, etc. Selection is all a matter of taste and purpose. Read on in the Species Description List for more information and color photos. Keep in mind, also, that young plants may not immediately show colors and variegation when you receive them, but these features will become more prominent after the first year or two. And some features appear only in certain conditions and may not yet be present when you receive the plant. For example, red and purplish coloration of canes is only brought out by direct sun consistently hitting the canes themselves.\nTo purchase plants, please see our Plant Price List , which also contains photo access and specific details about each plant.\nTo read one-paragraph descriptions of many of our plants and also access photos, please see Species Descriptions .\nTo search for plants by your criteria: Click here to Search for plants by your criteria (such as height, cold-hardiness, sun/shade, clumper or runner)\nRegional Recommendations\nWe provide these suggestions to help you make your selections; however, no guarantee of success is implied. The following recommendations are generalizations, and do not account for microclimatic differences. Before selecting a species for your garden, always check the temperature, sun/shade ratings, height, and running/clumping type, and take into account your humidity levels.\nFar South (Tropical, semi-tropical, humid, warm year round, no frost)\nRecommended: Bambusas, Chusqueas, Dendrocalamus, Drepanostachyums, Himalayacalamus, and all Phyllostachys, including Ph. nigra 'Henon,' except those noted below. Can be planted any time of year.\nNot recommended: All Semiarundinarias, Phyllostachys nuda, and all Ph. nigras (except Ph. nigra 'Henon'), which need cold winters and cooler summer nights to do well. Also Fargesias, Himalayacalamus hookerianus \"Blue Bamboo,\" Chusquea circinata, and Ch. sulcata will not do well in areas where the temperatures exceed 100 F. and summer nights are above 70 F.\nSouth East (Hot, humid summers, some winter frost and down to 10 F. in some areas)\nRecommended: Almost anything will grow in this area if minimum temperature rating of species is appropriate. It is one of the few areas that Phyllostachys heterocycla pubescens 'Moso' grows well. All bamboos in this region are best planted in spring, to maximize growing season. In the fall, be sure to plant at least 3 months before your first frost. In colder areas, clumpers should be mulched before wintertime.\nNot recommended: Chusquea circinata and Ch. sulcata, Fargesias, Himalayacalamus hookerianus \"Blue Bamboo,\" Phyllostachys nuda, and Semiarundinarias will not do well in areas where the temperatures exceed 100 F. and summer nights are above 70 F.\nSouth West (Low desert, with hot, dry summers and very light or no frost in winter)\nRecommended: Bambusas, Otateas, Phyllostachys and Semiarundinarias (exceptions noted below), Hibanobambusa, Pseudosasa japonica \"Arrow Bamboo\" and \"Pleioblastoides,\" and most Pleioblastus species. Drepanostachyum sengteeanum, Borinda boliana, Chusquea nigricans, and Ch. pittieri may also do ok. In shade, Yushania, some Himalayacalamus, and other Drepanostachyums may be grown as well. All variegated forms of the above genera and dwarf forms of Pleioblastus should also be grown in shade only. It's best to plant in mild fall weather to give plants time to get established before hot summer temperatures and take advantage of winter rains. Shield plants from extreme heat, cold, and sun when first planted. They will also need frequent watering in this climate, probably daily in summer. All plants will look somewhat better if in a little shade some part of the day. Installation of misters to mist the foliage daily is an optional but useful aid to help plants get established, look their best and grow ultimately taller.\nNot recommended: Bambusa multiplex 'Silverstripe,' B. vulgaris vittata, Chusquea circinata and sulcata, Fargesias, Sasas, Himalayacalamus hookerianus \"Blue Bamboo,\" Indocalamus, Semiarundinaria fastuosa, and Phyllostachys nuda.\nHigh Desert (Hot, dry summers, cool nights, cold winters)\nRecommended: Pleioblastus, Semiarundinarias and Phyllostachys(except as noted below), Sasella masamuneana albostriata, Psuedosasa japonica \"Arrow Bamboo\" and 'Pleioblastoides,' and Hibanobambusas. Be sure to check that the temperature rating for the species is appropriate for your area. Chusquea nigricans may do all right, but there are no other clumpers that will do well in this climate. All variegated forms of the above genera and dwarf forms of Pleioblastus should be grown in shade only. Early spring after danger of frost is past is the best time to plant, in order to allow them to get established before the extreme heat arrives, and it's good to shelter plants from extreme heat, cold, or sun when first planted. Plants in this climate will need frequent watering, probably daily in summer. All plants will look somewhat better if in shade some part of the day. Installation of misters to mist the foliage daily is an optional but useful aid to help plants get established, look their best and grow ultimately taller.\nNot recommended : Bambusas, Fargesias, Sasas, Indocalamus, Phyllostachys nuda, Semiarundinaria fastuosa.\nNorth (Cold winters down to 0 to \u009620 F.)\nRecommended: all Fargesias (shade plants which are native to high mountain environments) are a good choice. Also many Phyllostachys, with bissetii, nuda, rubromarginata being among the most cold-hardy; Pleioblastus, particularly simonii and simonii 'heterophyllus'; many Semiarundinarias and Sasas. Be sure to check that the temperature rating for the species is appropriate for your area. Spring is the best planting season, allowing the whole growing season to get established before the next winter. In fall, plant at least 3 months before first frost. Mulching deeply in the cold season is also important, using 12 inches of wood shavings, leaves, or hay and then removing the mulch in the spring. Some plants may freeze back in winter, but if mulched deeply will shoot up again in the spring. In the coldest regions mature heights will be lower.\nNot recommended: any plants not designated to be cold-hardy enough for your lowest nighttime winter temperatures.\nNear Ocean (At least 200' away from water, with salt laden air, but not salt spray) In general, bamboo does not like salt laden air and is prone to leaf tip burn. However, the following bamboos are relatively more salt tolerant.\nRecommended: Assuming the species' temperature rating is appropriate for your area, some good choices are the Bambusas, Otatea acuminata, Pseudosasa japonica, Chimonobambusa quadrangularis, Semiarundinaria fastuosa, Pleioblastus hindsii, Pl. gramineus, Pl. simonii and simonii 'heterophyllus.' (Certain other families of bamboo can grow here but are much more vulnerable to leaf tip burn: Phyllostachys, Dendrocalamus, Fargesias and some Chusqueas, such as Ch. pittieri, sulcata, circinata, foliosa, and the culeous).\nWest Coast\nThis region has many highly varied microclimates, and thus can sustain a multitude of bamboo species. Hot and dry climates may choose from recommendations made for the southwest or high desert, colder mountain climates from the northern recommendations, etc. Again, always make sure your temperatures, sun exposure, sun-shade, and humidity are appropriate for any particular species you may choose. One nice feature is that Bamboo in the West is a deer-proof plant! Because there is no bamboo native to the west coast and the deer did not co-evolve with it, they will not eat bamboo unless it is the only fodder for miles around.\nBamboo Indoors\nBamboos can sometimes be successfully and beautifully grown indoors, but only if you have a very green thumb and can give them adequate light, humidity, moving fresh air, and attentive observation and care. Also, because indoor environments are usually less than ideal, rotating your plants outdoors in mild conditions is often a wise practice for their long-term health. It is very important to read and apply all of the following guidelines if you want your bamboo houseplants to look healthy and beautiful for more than a few months. We provide no guarantee for plants placed in indoor environments, but if you are feeling adventurous and have a good green thumb, read on!\nHumidity: Bamboos need high ambient moisture levels. Daily misting is recommended to compensate for the lower humidity of most interiors, especially while winter heating is in use. Humidity may also be provided by placing a small fountain or humidifier nearby. It's also best to keep plants in cooler locations and away from heaters.\nLight: Bamboos do best indoors with at least all day bright indirect natural light. Most will do better with a few hours of direct sun. The less light, the slower growth will be. Also, severe leaf drop may occur as a plant adjusts to less light and ambient moisture. If this occurs, often the plant will grow new leaves which are more acclimated to the indoor conditions. Please check the Sun/Shade Ratings listed under \"Indoor Plant Selection\" (or on our Price Lists for other plants that interest you).\nSoil: We recommend a light\u0094potting mix, consisting of 1/3 soil, 1/3 peat moss, and 1/3 perlite in order provide excellent drainage and enable the soil to aerate and dry out more quickly after watering, to prevent root rot. If you also place a layer of gravel in the bottom of your pot (which must have holes for drainage, of course), you can place the pot in a saucer of water. Without the layer of gravel, the pot must be raised up to keep it out of the water that collects in the saucer.\nWatering: For the same reasons, close attention to watering is very important for bamboos kept indoors. They should be watered in small amounts, deeply enough that roots are kept moist (a little water should run out the bottom), but not so much that the soil stays soggy for days. The top 2-3\u0094inches of soil should be allowed to dry out before watering again. Below the 4\u0094inch depth, soil should be lightly moist around the roots at all times.\nAir Movement: We have found it very helpful to have some air flow in the area with yor indoor bamboo, fresh air from outdoors, if possible. For this reason, entryways or rooms with windows near the plants that can be kept partially open seem to work best.\nFertilizer: For container-grown bamboos, we like the slow-release fertilizers supplemented with trace minerals. We use Apex, 14-14-14, a product similar to Osmocote, 14-14-14, with a 4-6 month release rate, depending on temperature. Dosage depends on size of container:\n1 Tbsp per 1 gal container, 2 Tbsp per 5 gal container, 4 Tbsp per 15 gal container, \u00bd C. per 25 gal container, 1 C. per 3' x 3' container.\nHeight: Indoors, bamboos generally grow only a fraction of their maximum height and diameter, so we recommend that you buy a plant that is already as close as possible to the size you ultimately want.\nTroubleshooting: Yellowing leaves usually indicate either too little or too much water. If there is too much water and the roots are rotting, the leaves may look pale and droopy. Too little water may cause leaves to have brown tips, curl up, look dry and yellow, and begin to drop. The roots may have dried out just once or are root-bound and not absorbing water well. When under- or over-watering is corrected quickly, the plant will often re-leaf in a month or two and be healthy. Dig down 3-4 inches into the soil frequently to monitor moisture. Root-bound plants may be placed in a large saucer of water for a half-hour or so to soak up water from the bottom.\nBamboos grown indoors are more vulnerable to insect pests and disease, as they are generally more stressed than they would be outdoors. Insects may be treated with the usual sprays (best applied outdoors). If the plant is small, simply washing the leaves under running water can be effective. (Please also see Possible Pests ).\nSuggested Indoor Bamboos: Click here for the list .\nRemoval of Bamboo\nWhile we at Bamboo Sourcery are bamboo lovers, we recognize that occasionally there arises the need or desire to reduce or remove entirely a clump or a stand of bamboo. Unfortunately, this often occurs due to inadequate or inaccurate information available to consumers regarding the types of bamboo and effective containment methods. To learn more about the types of bamboo and containment methods for bamboo, please see the section titled Clumping and Running Bamboos .\nBelow are our recommended methods for removing bamboo.\nRemoval Methods: Many people ask about using Round-Up or other herbicides to kill bamboo. We do not recommend it. Not only will Round-up poison your soil (and possibly yourself), but the root mass left in the ground will make other uses or replanting of the same area difficult, if not impossible, and often the plants will still re-shoot. If you are, nevertheless, determined to use Round Up, remember that the poison is taken in through the leaves only, and it must be applied in an undiluted form, which is sometimes difficult to find.\nThe most effective method of removal of bamboo is to dig out the entire root and rhizome mass as thoroughly as possible, including fragments. To make the job easier, water the area deeply a few days before digging. Start on the outside of the clump or grove and work your way inward. The roots generally do not grow deeper than 6-18 inches and you usually can chop them into chunks and pull them out piece by piece. (If you want to remove super large chunks at one time, you can dig deeply around the circumference of a chunk, tie a strong rope or chain around it, and pull it out with a truck or tractor!)\nIt is likely that you will miss a few root fragments here and there, and over the next few seasons you may see an occasional shoot coming up. If you wish, you can force any root fragments to shoot by watering the area for awhile. Then, simply snap them off at soil level by hand while they are small and tender. The tiny root fragments will thus be deprived of nourishment from above and will die off. (This does not kill larger pieces of root).\nTools for Removing Bamboo: A shovel, hatchet, ax, pick, strong maddox, and a long, strong pry bar are the most common tools used for removing bamboo. When we dig a large area of a giant timber species, we also use a carbide-tipped chain saw and a special heavy duty chopping bar. If you have access to such tools, they will save you time and effort.\nRemoval Services: We are sometimes able to offer bamboo removal services. If you live within a 2-hour drive of Sebastopol, CA and have a significant amount of a species we can use, we may be able to come, during the appropriate digging seasons for your particular plant, and remove your bamboo. If you have bamboo that you would like us to remove, give us a phone call to initiate the conversation.\nIn order to determine whether the plant may be useful to us and the feasibility of digging, we will need a few photographs and/or cane samples sent to us: i.e. a length of cane with 1-2 nodes, branches, and leaves in a zip-loc bag and then in a brown envelope. We will also need some information about the height of your plant, size of the area it covers, soil type, surrounding structures, and any other relevant details, including your address and phone number. Scheduling is sometimes unpredictable, so flexibility in scheduling is very helpful.\n\u00a9 Bamboo Sourcery, 2004\nDefinitions\nCulm A stem which is hollow except at the nodes, as are the bamboo canes.\nDiaphragm The rigid membrane which forms the partition within the nodes, adding strength to the cane.\nInternode Portion of the culm or cane between nodes.\nNode Point on the culm from which branches and leaves grow on the outside, and where the diaphragm appears inside, separating hollow segments of the culm.\nRhizome A type of rootstock consisting of a creeping stem, usually growing horizontally underground. In the case of bamboo, the rhizomes are woody and segmented just like the culms.\nSheath An enclosing \"leaf\" which protects the young shoots, culms, and sometimes branches as well. May be dropped or retained as shoot matures.\nShoot New culm which has just broken ground, arising from a rhizome underground, completely covered with sheaths, and poised to demonstrate bamboo's reputation for phenomenally rapid growth. Bamboo shoots are a delicacy in Chinese cuisine.\nSulcus A groove along the length of the internode, sometimes of a different color from the rest of the cane.\nArundinaria\nA genus of medium sized, hardy, running bamboos with 3-6 branches at each node, persistent culm sheaths, and no sulcus. Formerly, several Pleioblastus and Yushania were listed as Arundinaria. Shoots in late spring.\nPSAT Pseudosasa amabilis \"Tonkin Cane\" Formerly Known as Arundinaria amabilis Known for the very high quality of its wood. Culms used to be imported from China for making split bamboo fishing poles. Vast quantities of stakes are still imported for the nursery trade. The species grows best in areas with hot, humid summers, where it reaches heights of 50' and 2 \u00bd\" in diameter. Best growth with good indirect light. Hardy to 10F. Formerly known as Arundinaria amabiis\nBambusa\nA genus of tropical and subtropical clumping bamboos from Asia, America and Africa that shoot all year 'round, especially summer and fall. Bambusas usually have round culms with numerous branches at each node, although one or two usually predominate. The species grows best in full sun and are successful in almost any climate, including coastal environments and even desert areas, as long as winter temperatures are not too cold.\nBDOS Bambusa dolichomerithalla 'Green Stripe' Will grow to 18' in the Bay Area.\nBDOSS Bambusa Dolichomerithalla 'Silver Stripe' Upright culms of this tight clumper are dark green with silver-white striping on long internodes, making it a beautiful accent clump. Traditionally used as a blowpipe for cooking in Taiwan. Hardy to 20 degrees F, grows 12' tall locally.\nBMP\nBambusa multiplex The typical form of a very useful garden species. All forms share the moniker \"Hedge Bamboo,\" taking well to pruning and shaping. They tolerate colder temperatures than other Bambusas, being hardy to 13 degrees F. or more, and do well in most Northern California climate zones. Winter chill eliminates scale and mealy bugs, which commonly afflict them in warmer climates. Grows from 35' to 45' with 1 1/2\" diamters in climate of origin and 15-20' in N. California.\nBMPA\nBambusa multiplex 'Alphonse Karr' This is a very popular garden form with attractive gold culms with multiple green stripes. The new culms often have a pinkish or reddish cast. Shoots year 'round, growing up to 15' tall in the original environment and 12' to 20' in California.\nBMPG\nBambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess' Growth habit similar to 'Fernleaf' but smaller, with smaller leaves and light orange canes. Usually 8 to 10' tall with \u00bd\" culms in northern California; 20' with 1/2\" culms in climate of origin. Great for low screen.\nBMPGS Bambusa multiplex 'Gold Stripe' A moderate sized clumper similar in form to Bambusa multiplex 'Alphons Karr,' but with green culms exhibiting a single gold stripe in the grooves. Grows 25' tall with 1.5\" diameter culms in the climate of origin, and approximately 15' tall in the SF Bay Area. Likes plenty of sun and is cold hardy to 18F.\nBMPT Bambusa multiplex 'Tiny Fern' A wonderful bamboo for small hedges (3' max. ht.) or bonsai. Clusters of small, light grayish-green pointed leaves. Culms are light green to brown. A clumper hardy to 13 degrees, preferring half to-full day sun.\nBOL\nBambusa oldhamii \"Giant Timber\" A giant timber clumper growing 55' tall and 4\" in diameter in southern California and 20' to 30' up north. Long known for its large, olive green culms, vertical and clumping growth habit, and tasty shoots. Hardy to 20 degrees. Not good in desert climates.\nBTE\nBambusa textilis 'Weaver's Bamboo' A stately, upright giant timber clumper which grows 20 to 30' tall in northern California and taller in the south. Forms a very tight column of elegant, blue powdered, 1 1/2 - 2\" blue-green canes, shaded by well foliated, arching tops. Excellent for either screening or free standing ornamental. Hardy to 13 degrees. Considered a choice bamboo for weaving because of its strong yet pliable fibers and the absence of prominent culm nodes.\nBTU Bambusa tuldoides Also known as \"Punting Pole Bamboo\" from its Asian heritage of poling boats. Culms are thick walled and straight, making them useful for many purposes. Under ideal conditions it can grow to 55' tall and 2 \u00bc\" in diameter. Olive green, shiny, upright and full foliage from bottom to top when mature. Hardy to 18 degrees.\nBVE Bambusa ventricosa \"Buddha's Belly\" Bright green culms sometimes develop characteristic internodal swelling when subject to high summer heat. In humid, warm climates it can grow 55' tall and 2 \u00bc\" in diameter. Cold hardy to 18 degrees. Makes interesting subject for bonsai.\nBVEK Bambusa ventricosa 'Holochrysa Kimmei' Very ornamental plant. Similarly to Bambusa ventricosa, culms sometimes develop characteristic internodal swelling when subject to high summer heat, but culm is yellow with multiple green stripes. In humid, warm climates it can grow 55' tall and 2 \u00bc\" in diameter. Will grow to 25' in the Bay Area. Cold hardy to 18 degrees. An especially exciting subject for bonsai.\nA genus of two species of running bamboos from China which shoots in early spring.\nBAF\nBashania fargesii (Sometimes classified as Arundinaria fargesii). A new introduction with dense, vertical growth good for screening. Attractive dark green leaves, an inch or so wide by 6-8\" long, grace 15-20' silver/gray culms. Hardy to 0 degrees. Full sun to part shade.\nBorinda\nA recently created genus of clumpers and \"open clumpers\" from the mountainous regions of Asia, composed of several species that had been previously assigned to other genera, such as Fargesia, Yushania, Arundinaria, Thamnocalamus, and Himalayacalamus. Classification of these bamboos has been problematic. Shooting season is variable.\nBRA\nBorinda albocerea This bamboo is similar to Borinda boliana with blue-green powdery canes, but an open clumper with larger blue green leaves. Reaches 20' tall with 1' diameter culms in the climate of origin. Culms are very straight with slight arching at top. Will grow in bright indirect light to half-day sun. Cold hardy to 0.\nBRF\nBorinda fungosa (frmrly Fargesia fungosa) \"Chocolate Bamboo\" Ornamental weeping bamboo that can be used as a screen or centerpiece. Likes a half-day of morning sun to half-day afternoon sun, and culms will turn chocolate-red and shiny with more sun. Has light green leaves, \u00bd\" x 3-5\", which grow in small clusters at each node. This clumper grows to 14' and is hardy to 10 degrees.\nBrachystachyum\nA one species genus from China similar to Semiarundinaria, which shoots in late spring.\nBXD Brachystachyum densiflorum (Sometimes classified as Arundinaria densiflora or Bashania densiflora). A runner which grows to 6' tall, has swollen nodes, and is hardy to at least 5 degrees. Full sun to part shade. It was introduced to the USA in 1986, and not much is known about it.\nA genus of medium sized bamboos from the Himalayas, China and Japan, which shoot fall and winter, and are difficult to propagate. Many branches per node. Thin culm sheaths fall away within a year. Those listed below are vigorous runners.\nCBM\nChimonobambusa marmorea \"Red\" Also known as \"Marbled\" Bamboo\u0094 because its new shoots are marbled with cream and purple. Masses of bright green leaves form on multiple short branches. The culms will produce reddish color when grown in certain conditions: leaves must be stripped from the lower 2/3 of the culms, and the culms must be exposed to warm morning sun. However, in the afternoon the plant prefers shade, and hot afternoon sun will yellow the leaves. In hotter southern states, this plant must be kept in shade all day, and therefore cane color will be chestnut brown, as they usually are when shipped, also. With the proper sun exposure this makes an attractive container plant and is excellent for erosion control or hedges. Grows 6' to 8' tall and \u00bc\" to \u00bd\" in diameter. Hardy to 10.\nCBMV Chimonobambusa marmorea 'Variegata' Same as CBM, except leaves are occasionally striped with narrow white lines. The cane also develop a showy, reddish color with sun exposure.\nCBQ\nChimonobambusa quadrangularis \"Square\" Unique in several ways, this plant has culms whose opposite sides are flat, forming a rounded square. Culms are rough to the touch with large nodes, and grow in an upright form. Graceful foliage is arranged in attractive tiers, creating a waterfall effect, or if topped, an umbrella-like shape. Looks best in part shade where leaves grow dark green; leaves exposed to bright sun are more yellow. This plant prefers cool daytime and nighttime temperatures, needs plentiful water, and is extra sensitive to dry conditions - may drop leaves if watering is missed. Can grow 25' tall and 1\u00bd\" in diameter. Hardy to 10 F and tolerant of salt air.\nCBQS\nChimonobambusa quadrangularis 'Suow' Highly ornamental bamboo from China which is also good for screening . Similar to CBQ, but canes are gold with thin green stripes, and the new shoots are occasionally pink. Will grow indoors with 2-3 hours direct sun and misting. A good container plant.\nCBTUM\nChimonobambusa tumidissinoda \"walking stick\" A rare Chinese bamboo noted for its widened culm nodes, like two closed cymbals. Used for walking sticks in Sichuan. Graceful, arching green culms with delicate palmate foliage resemble a large, lacey Japanese maple. Moderate runner.\nChusquea\nThis genus comes from Central and South America where there are about 90 species. Uniquely, the Chusqueas have solid culms and exhibit a whorl of multiple branches at each node, giving them a distinctive look. Leaves are usually small and narrow, and most are clumpers with gracefully arching or trailing culms and branches. While highly ornamental and mostly tolerant of acid soil, many have little heat tolerance and are difficult to establish. Coastal California and much of the San Francisco Bay Area have prime Chusquea climates. Most are newly introduced to the U.S. and hard to find. Shooting is in the spring for most species.\nCHCI\nChusquea circinata Beautiful tropical bamboo from Chiapas, Mexico, with long narrow leaves, \u00bc\" x 3 \u00bd\". Culms grow up to 20' and are shiney dark brown with full sun and light brown with less sun. Has a feathery weeping look early in life. As the plant gets older, it becomes more upright and dense. Requires excellent drainage and tops will die in temperatures colder than 20 degrees for more than 10 days. Returns to same height if roots have been well-mulched. Does poorly in areas where summer temperatures go over 100 in the daytime and remain above 70 F. at night.\nCHCQ\nChusquea culeou (61-11) 'Chilean Straight' A superlative hardy ornamental, long cultivated in England but new to the USA. One of the most beautiful and colorful Chusqueas, with dark blue-green nodes on lime-green to yellow culms. Mature plants look like tall clumps of giant feathers. They grow 20' tall at high elevations in Southern Chile and will thrive between 0 and 90 F.\nCHCUM Chusquea cumingii A climbing bamboo with attractive bluish leaves and trailing canes which may reach 1\" in diameter, 40' in length, and 10' in height, depending on surrounding foliage, or a large arbor or trellis for support. Makes a very effective canopy; best in a large scale environment. A clumping type, but\u0085this is one of a handful of bamboos that grow new culms from the nodes of existing culms as well as from the root. Hardy to 10 degrees, preferring half to full day of sun.\nCHCW Chusquea culeou (6-11) 'Chilean Weeping' New to the U.S. and another very striking Chusquea resembling CHCQ. Lime green culms with dark green nodes are tall and upright with weeping branches and delicate green foliage, also resembling giant, arching feathers. It grows to 20' tall with 1\u00bd\" diameter in N. California and is hardy to 0 degrees.\nCHGI Chusquea gigantea Another Chusquea new to the U.S., growing about 25' tall and 1\u00be\" inches in diameter with exceptionally long branches at 3-4\u00bd feet. This plant has an airy look, a delightful specimen plant but too open for screening.\nCHMI Chusquea mimosa 'Australis' A new introduction from southern Brazil, this is a very interesting and delicate looking plant. Widely arching canes with small, delicate branches and leaves create a lacey fountain shape. In the spring, new shoots growing up through the clump are initially black, turning more burgundy color as they gain height. Then the culm sheaths fall, revealing light green smooth canes with slightly enlarged nodes. Grows to 15' tall with 1\" diameter canes in Brazil and is cold hardy to 20 degrees. Prefers a half-day of sun, but may grow in full sun.\nCHMU Chusquea muelleri A new introduction from Mexico, this is a small, deeply weeping, trailing bamboo, with dense foliage. Very thin culms have slightly widened nodes and medium size green leaves, 5\" x \u00be\". Best in bright light to a half-day of afternoon sun. Cold hardy to 22 F.\nCHNI Chusquea sp. 'Nigricans' May be a dwarf form of culeou. It grows from 6 to 10', has stiffly vertical leaves and branches, and thrives between 0 and 90 degrees. It is one of the few bamboos which can grow in very wet soils, as well in typical garden conditions. Needs acid soil to look its best.\nCHSU\nChusquea sulcata (seedlings) One of the most beautiful, graceful and tropical looking bamboos, the sulcata has golden yellow culms with dark green widened nodes and very thin, feathery green leaves, 4-5\" in length, on a whorl of short branches surrounding each node. Very delicate and airy with an umbrella shape overall, growing to 8-15' tall and 1\" in diameter. Tolerates temperatures down to only 28 degrees and likes half to a full day of sun. Will die back at 20 degrees, but if mulched grows back to same height in one season. Does poorly in areas where summer temperatures go over 100 in the daytime and remain above 70 F. at night.\nCHVA\nChusquea valdiviensis The largest of the climbing bamboos and the most robust of Chilean bamboos, reaching heights of 80' by clambering up trees and draping them with curtains of foliage. Culms grow to 1 \u00bd\" in diameter. Attractive on a large scale with trees or a large trellis for support. This is the largest of a handful of bamboos that grow new culms from the nodes of existing culms as well as from the root. Its temperature range is 10 to 100 degrees.\nDrepanostachyum\nA genus of beautiful, medium sized, clumping, Himalayan bamboos. Culms arch in upper part and many thin branches half encircle each node. Shoots in the spring.\nDRK Drepanostachyum khasianum Very similar to HCH but with blue-green culms. It also tolerates up to full day sun, and grows only to 12 feet tall with \u00bd\" diameter culms.\nDRS Drepanostachyum sengteeanum A tight clumper with slender, bright green culms which bend under the weight of abundant, small narrow leaves, creating a delicate, graceful look. It grows to 15 feet, does best in part shade, and is hardy to 17 degrees. It is an outstandingly beautiful ornamental.\nFargesia\nA genus of very hardy, small to medium-sized, clumping mountain bamboos from the cool alpine conifer forests of West and southwest China. These plants generally have thin canes with small leaves. Not recommended for Southeastern states in the US where nighttime summer temperatures remain above 70 F. The Fargesias are generally shade plants, but may tolerate more sun in the S.F. Bay Area when getting ample daily water. These plants shoot in the spring and fall.\nFADR Fargesia dracocephala 'Rufa' This versatile and popular new form of Fargesia is more sun and heat tolerant. Unlike most fargesias, this species can handle a full day of sun in N. Cal, which will produce lighter green, shiney leaves. In more shade the leaves will be dark green and shiney. In maturity, it has the characteristic weeping \"umbrella\" shape, and the culm sheaths and branches are copper colored. Hardy to -5 F.\nFAM\nFargesia murieliae \"Umbrella Bamboo\" An attractive clumping ornamental frequently used in European gardens, it is hardy to -20 degrees, likes shade, and grows to 15' tall. It is found in China at elevations of 10,000 feet, where it is an important food for the Giant Pandas. Small closely spaced bluish-green culms and delicate foliage create a deeply arching, umbrella-like form. Does not do well in summer heat, especially where nights do not cool down below 70 F. Flowered in 1994 in northern California.\nFAN\nFargesia nitida (seedling) Formerly known as Sinarundinaria nitida. A choice ornamental, it grows to 12 feet tall with slender arching branches, forming a fountain shape. Dark purplish culms are covered with a bluish-white powder when young, and leaves are delicate and attractive. Nitida is is exceptionally cold resistant, withstanding -15 degrees, and is probably the most popular bamboo in northern Europe. Several related nitida varieties began flowering in Europe in 2002-2003. Flowering of the basic nitida occurred in N. California in 2003. New seedlings available now.\nGelidocalamus\nA genus of small to medium sized, running bamboos botanically similar to Indocalamus and Chimonobambusa. Shoots in the spring.\nGEG Gelidocalamus (Arun) fangianus A new introduction from West Sichuan China, where it is a primary food for the Giant Panda. This is a dwarf bamboo, growing to about 10' under conifers in China and reaching about 6' in northern California. Its best feature is its foliage with rather large leaves, about 2\" x 6\",\u0094 providing a texture that contrasts with other small-leaved plants. It is cold-hardy to 5 degrees.\nHibanobambusa\nA probable hybrid of Ph. nigra 'Henon' and Sasa veitchii f. tyugokensis from Mt. Hiba on Honshu, Japan. Both forms of the plant are aggressive runners with single branches and wide leaves up to 10\" long and 1\u00bd\" wide. The species grow about 15' tall, are cold hardy to -5 degrees, and and make good container plants and screens. Shoots in the spring.\nHBT Hibanobambusa tranquilans Similar to HBTS, but this is the all green form.\nHBTS\nHibanobambusa tranquilans 'Shiroshima' Quite striking for its brightly variegated leaves, which are white and yellow with vivid green stripes and about 1 \u00bd\"\u0094 x 8-10\"\u0094 in size. Canes are fairly unremarkable and are largely hidden by the leaves in the mature plant. The young plant has a rather open look, however. Makes an excellent screen up to 15'\u0092 in height. Likes full sun in temperate climates, but half to full-day of shade in very hot climates. Cold hardy to -5 degrees.\nA genus from Nepal to the north-eastern most part of India at elevations of 2,250 to 2,750 m. Shoots in the spring.\nHCA\nHimalayacalamus asper (formerly NMC: Neo. microphyllus) This Tibetan bamboo is a stately and highly decorative ornamental. In more sun, culms turn maroon to almost black with delicate purplish green leaves. In summer shade, the culms remain rich green with white node rings. Culms get darker, sometimes almost black, in winter. Grows to 20' tall with 1\u00bd\" in diameter in the climate of origin, 15'\u0092 tall with \u00be\"\u0094 diameter here locally. Can tolerate temperatures down to only 15 degrees, and likes a half-day of sun. Shoots in the spring and fall.\nHCC\nHimalayacalamus cupreus This new introduction is a tight clumper with foliage and growth habit similar to H. falconeri 'Damarapa',\u0092 with less arching at the top. New shoots are unique in having light green sheaths with spiraling dark green stripes. Sheaths are dropped quickly as the solid, dark green culms grow about 20' tall and 1 \u00bc\" diameter in the climate of origin. Cold hardy to 20 F. Most attractive as an isolated clump.\nHCF Himalayacalamus falconeri This plant is a cultivar of Himalayacalamus falconeri 'Damarapa.' The culms are dark green without any striping, with abundant deep green leaves, 3/4\" wide by 4 1/2\" long, similar to the Damarapa. Tolerates a little more sun and more shade, but height and diameter are the same as the Damarapa.\nHCFD\nHim. falconeri 'Damarapa' (formerly Drepanostachum hookerianum)\"candy stripe\" A highly decorative plant: gold canes with multiple green stripes, becoming shades of pink, cranberry, and purple with dark stripes in the spring and summer sun. Looks best with some leaves trimmed away from lower parts of canes to expose to sun and show off colors. Masses of leaves grow on long, slender, arching branchlets. Grows up to 30' tall with 2\" diameter culms in the climate of origin. Here locally, it can reach 16' in height with 1.5\" diameters. Prefers a half-day of sun, morning or afternoon, except in climates with frequent 100 degree summer temperatures, where it tolerates am sun and bright, indirect light only. Hardy to 20 degrees.\nHCHF Himalayacalamus hookerianus 'Falcatus' Almost identical in appearance to 'Blue Bamboo', but more gray-blue and shorter, growing about 15' in the climate of origin. Tolerates a full day of sun, but also is less cold hardy at 25 degrees.\nHCP Himalayacalamus porcatus A very upright, tight clumper with light green leaves and misty green canes covered with a white powder. New shoot sheaths are almost black, but drop off as the culms grow, revealing nearly white new culms, which darken only slightly with age. Multiple short branches grow from each node, and culms reach 15' tall and 1\" in diameter in the climate of origin. Cold hardy to 20 F. Excellent specimen plant or hedge.\nIndocalamus\nA genus of small Asian running bamboos which shoot in spring and are relatively hardy. Most have extremely large, wide, tropical-looking leaves and tolerate low light levels.\nINLA Indocalamus latifolius Has leaves 2\" wide by 1' long with a somewhat stiff and spiky appearance. It grows 6' tall, is hardy to 0 degrees, and prefers shade. A recent import.\nINLO\nIndocalamus longiauritus Has attractive, dark green leaves on upright, solid culms. Leaves are up to 1 \u00bc\" wide by 7\" long. Good house or garden plant. Tolerates a wide range of light exposure.

It tolerates lower light levels than any other bamboo. Planted in total shade it forms an attractive 3' tall mounded ground cover. In bright light to filtered sun it may grow to 7' tall. This plant also makes a nice tropical-looking house plant. Hardy to -10 degrees.\nIndosasa\nISC Indosasa crassifolia Makes a great isolated clump or hedge. This is a decorative bamboo similar to INLO, but has smaller, narrower leaves, 1\" x 5\".\u0094Leaves are smokey green color. Grows 15' tall, 1\" in diameter. Grows in indirect light but prefers full sun in most environments. Shoots in the spring.\nA genus of medium sized tropical Mexican bamboos which shoot in mid-summer.\nOAAZ\nOtatea acuminata aztecorum \"Mexican Weeping\" A beautiful, drought resistant, clumping ornamental from the Chaparral of Mexico. Masses of long narrow leaves hang in graceful plumes on smokey green culms. This plant loves full sun and hot temperatures but may also be planted in light shade. Reaches 15' to 20' tall. It requires very good drainage, but tolerates salt air, alkalinity, and clay soils. The Otatea is hardy to only 20 degrees and may experience leaf drop and cane die-back at 18 degrees. This plant may reach heights of 15-20' in ideal conditions with warm, relatively dry winters, but in areas with more frost and occasional temperatures in the teens, it may maintain heights of only 5'-12'.\nPhyllostachys\nA genus of medium to giant runners with a distinct groove (sulcus) on the culm above paired branches. The heaviest shooting occurs in spring. All species have edible shoots. Nearly all can thrive with hot summers and cold winters. Most come from China. All grow best in full sun but can take some shade. The wide range of conditions under which this genus can be grown, plus its utility and beauty, have caused it to be the most commonly cultivated genus in the world.\nPHAH Ph. arcana Great bamboo for erosion control, visual screening and edible shoots. Runner with shiny green culms that are occasionally zig-zagged at the base. Reaches up to 27' tall, with dark green leaves 5/8\" x 4\". Hardy to 0 degrees and does best with half to full day sun.\nPHAJ\nPh. aurea \"Hedge Bamboo\" \"Golden\" (also known as \"Golden Bamboo\") The most common and popular bamboo in much of the U.S, it is easy to grow, drought resistant, and great for screens and hedges, as well as containers. Dense light green foliage covers the plant from top to bottom. Culms are light green with a white node ring, turning more yellow if exposed to direct sun. Distinguishing characteristic is the short, knobby, bulging internodes at the base of its culms, adding interest. The usual height here in N. California is between 10' and 15' with 2\" diameter culms, but it can reach 16' in its native environment. Because it can spread aggressively, it forms screens rapidly, and containment is recommended. It is hardy to 0 degrees and shoots in the spring.\nPHAM\nPh. aurea 'Flavescens-inversa' A very striking cultivar of PHAJ. The green canes show off a wide yellow stripe in the sulcus, creating alternating stripes of varying lengths up the cane.\nPHAN\nPhyllostachys aurea 'Holochrysa' \"True Gold\" A cultivar of PHAJ with light gold culms and occasional thin, vertical green stripes. New shoots come up green and gradually turn light yellow regardless of sun exposure.\nPHAO\nPh. aurea 'Koi' A cultivar of PHAJ with a soft green stripe in the sulcus on light yellow culms and occasional white stripes on the leaves. Unique to this bamboo is the extremely variable internode length and occasional bulging internodes, giving the canes a knobby look. Similar to Ph. aurea in its rapid growth, hardiness, versatility and resilience.\nPHAQ Ph. aureosulcata \"Yellow Groove\" This plant is a real stand-out with brightly colored green canes and a bold yellow vertical stripe in the sulcus. Frequently grows with a pronounced zig-zag at the base ('crookstem'). It is a vigorous runner with dark green leaves and tasty shoots. Maximum height (near Prattsville, Alabama) is 45' and 3\" in diameter, while in Northern California it usually grows 25-30'. This exceptionally cold tolerant bamboo withstands -10 degrees. The aureosulcata group is great for medium to large size hedges and specimen plants.\nPHAR\nPh. aureosulcata 'Alata' A dark green form of aureosulcata with frequent zig-zag in the canes and no stripe in the sulcus.\nPHARR Ph. aureosulcata 'Harbin' This cultivar has yellow culms with multiple green grooves running the length of each internode, with no sulcus stripe.\nPHAS\nPh. aureosulcata 'Spectabilis' A very attractive recent introduction with a green sulcus on bright yellow culms, turning cranberry red where sun strikes the cane in summer. A beautiful erect specimen or hedge plant.\nPHAU Ph. aureosulcata 'Lama Temple' A bright yellow cultivar of PHAS with occasional thin, vertical, green stripes around the cane (no sulcus stripe).\nPHB\nPh. bambusoides \"Madake\" Also known as 'Giant Japanese Timber Bamboo',\u0094this plant has bright green smooth canes and medium size leaves. One of the largest, reliable, easy-to-grow, temperate climate, giant bamboo, it can grow 72' tall and 6\" in diameter and produces excellent wood. It may reach 50' with 5\" diameter culms in N. California, and lends a strong, vertical, structural quality to any landscape. Before flowering in the 60's and 70's, it was the predominate bamboo cultivated in Japan. Next flowering and die-back not due until approximately 2085. Hardy to -5 degrees. Almost identical to Ph. vivax.\nPHBA Ph. bambusoides holochrysa 'All Gold' Decorative orangey beige culm with a few thin green stripes, and green leaves with cream to gold stripes. Culms almost translucent when sun is shining through them. Grows up to 30' tall 2' in diameter.

It sports gold stripes on green leaves as well as occasional white stripe on the green canes. Otherwise similar to PHBA. Tolerates full sun. Not to be confused with 'Richard Haubrich'.\nPHBC\nPh. bambusoides 'Castillon' This form, a mutation of Ph. bambusoides, has yellow culms with a light green stripe in the sulcus, and occasionally a few bright green stripes elsewhere. Leaves are green with a few bright yellow stripes. It grows up to 35' tall and 2\" in diameter in the climate of origin and about 25' tall in the SF Bay Area. This plant is hardy to 0 degrees and likes half to full day direct sunlight\nPHBI\nPh. bambusoides 'Castillon Inversa' A good ornamental hedge or centerpiece, this form is the reverse of PHBC with green culms and yellow stripes in a striated sulcus.\nPHBR\nPh. bambusoides 'Slender Crookstem' This form of bambusoides often grows with marked zig-zags or S-curves in the lower part of the culm, which is quite striking on such large canes. Smaller than the typical form, it grows 40-65' tall and 3-5\" in diameter in its native environment, and still is one of the tallest growing bamboos in northern California, reaching 50' tall and 5\" diameter.\nPHBY\nPh. bissetii A handsome, medium sized species with dark green, shiney leaves and green culms. Excellent for fast-growing, dense screens and hedges. Exceptionally hardy, withstanding temperatures to -15 degrees. If mulched, the rhizomes alone can probably withstand -30 degrees and shoot again in the spring. Does well in a wide range of light conditions. Grows to 23' tall and 1\" in diameter in the climate of origin and 15-18' tall in the SF Bay Area, but can be pruned to any height. Vigorous runner.\nPHC Ph. atrovaginata (congesta) \"Incense Bam.\" Especially useful in landscapes where the timber bamboo look is desired, but with less height, this plant gets 2\" in diameter and 25' tall locally. Air canals in rhizomes and roots make it well adapted for wetter soils. Surface of new culms have a sandalwood scent when rubbed in the warm sun. New shoots are excellent for eating . Runner that establishes and grows rapidly. Hardy to -15 degress.\nPHDEC\nPh. decora Culms are green with subtle rusty mottling. Grows to about 20' tall and 1 \u00bc\" in diameter. Hardy to -5 degrees. In China it is called the Beautiful Bamboo.\nPHDUL\nPh. dulcis Arching, soft green culms with occasional white stripes grow to 40' and 3\" in diameter. They tend to have large diameter for their height. Leaves are olive green. Cold hardy to -10 degrees and can grow close to full height even with those temperatures in winter. Fast growing giant bamboo with tasty shoots.\nPHF\nPh. flexuosa Named for the distinct zig-zag pattern shown by some of the culms. Medium size lime-green leaves grow on darker green canes, which turn burgundy color in direct sun. Grows up to 31' tall with 2\u00be\" diameter culms in the climate of origin, but is typically half that tall in the SF Bay Area, where it is usually grown as a short, arching hedge. Good for containers and great for erosion control. Cold hardy to -15 degrees. Likes full sun to a half-day of afternoon sun. Flowered and produced seed at Bamboo Sourcery in 1995.\nPHG Ph. glauca Grows in China to 70' tall and 5\" in diameter, while locally in Northern California it grows 40' tall and 2 \u00bd\" in diameter. It is a vigorous runner, hardy to -5 degrees. The young culms have a distinctive white powder creating a blue-green tone. As culms mature, they become a pale, yellow green. Excellent tolerance for both drought and alkalinity. This is a plant for many uses, such as hedging, erosion control, crafts and fencing.\nPHHP\nPh. heterocycla 'Pubescens' (china) \"Moso\" The largest growing species of the genus and considered by many to be the most beautiful, Moso is the most cultivated bamboo in China and Japan. The tops arch gracefully with masses of small leaves, reaching up to 80' tall with culms 8\" in diameter in the climate of origin. It produces especially tasty shoots in tropical environments and is used throughout Asia for construction. Moso is difficult to establish and requires lots of water, acidity, tropical humidity and heat to reach its full potential. It remains much shorter in less ideal circumstances (including California). Not for desert environments. Small plants should be partially shaded. Hardy to 0 degrees.\nPHHU\nPh. humilis Great for erosion control or as a hedge, this vertical bamboo with small leaves is distinctive because of its short culm internodes (4-6\"), and the first few internodes of each branch are hollow. A quick grower, 15-20' tall, hardy to 0 degrees, it likes half to full day sun. Leaves and culms are olive green.\nPHI Ph. iridescens Beautiful dark green leaves and culms and is useful as a visual screen and wind break. Grows up to 36' tall and 2 3/4\" in diameter in half-day afternoon sun or all day full sun. Hardy to 0 degrees.\nPHNF\nPh. nigra \"Black Bamboo\" One of the most popular bamboos, both for the black culms and the plumed masses of bright green leaves. The culms come up green and slowly turn black during the first year or two. Locally, in northern California, it grows about 20-30' tall and 1 \u00bd\" in diameter. The Black Bamboo prefers full sun and grows very slowly in complete shade, almost like a clumper. It is hardy to heat and drought tolerant, but is sensitive to salts and minerals in the air, water and soil, which readily result in leaf tip burn.\nPHNFF Ph. nigra 'Daikokuchiku' \"Giant Black\" Similar to above Black Bamboo, except that this clone has reached 57' tall and 3.3\" in diameter, possibly the greatest height of any bamboo in northern California. The parent grove is located in Folsom, California and is growing in well irrigated, deep, sandy loam. Summer temperatures are very hot, above 100 degrees for weeks on end. It does well in 80 degree summer heat as well. In many other California locations it more typically grows to about 50' in height.\nPHNG\nPh. nigra 'Bory' \"Leopard Bamboo\" A large relative of Black Bamboo, which, instead of turning black, develops large decorative brown/black spots on 3\" diameter green culms. It grows up to 50' tall and takes temperatures down to -5 degrees. As with the other forms of Ph. nigra, 'Bory' has very beautiful structure and foliage. Excellent tolerance for summer heat, winter cold, and drought. Cut and cured canes become dark yellow to beige with black and brown mottling, which make them exceptionally beautiful for musical instruments, furniture and crafts.\nPHNH Ph. nigra 'Hale' This type of black bamboo shows its color sooner than any other with new shoots that are mostly black when they break ground and turning completely black in 3-6 months. Canes are consistently solid black, even in the young plants. Grows to 20-30' tall, is hardy to -5 degrees and needs half to full day sun.

There are many types <em>of</em> <em>pots</em> <em>or</em> containers available today ranging from <em>ceramic</em> to <em>plastic</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Soil Mix and Containers\nfor Growing Healthy Plumeria\nPlumeria have become quite popular as container plants, especially for those of us living in climates where it is necessary to move plants to protect from freezing winter weather. To be successful at maintaining plant health and vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an equally well selected soil mix.\nContainer Type\nThere are many types of pots or containers available today ranging from ceramic to plastic. While the ceramic and clay pots are generally more decorative than black plastic nursery cans, they may not be the most ideal. I use the rigid variety of black plastic nursery containers for all of my plumeria. These containers have at least 4 good drainage holes towards the bottom to allow for great drainage. They come in many sizes; 1 gallon, 2 gal., 3 gal., 5 gal. etc... Also, they are cheap!! Salt buildup is not a problem as with standard clay pots. The black plastic nursery containers are much less likely to develop a drainage problem than pots with only one drainage hole in the bottom center. Roots can grow freely through the many drainage holes without much risk of stopping drainage. In clay pots with only one drain, a tap root can fill the hole and stop drainage. If this problem were to go undetected during a wet season or after heavy watering, the Plumeria roots could be severely damaged or killed. It is therefore necessary to choose your containers carefully for the plant it will contain.\nContainer Size\nChoosing the correct container for your Plumeria may be one of the most important factors in determining how well it will perform for you. Experience has shown that Plumeria need ample root room while actively growing. Those grown in open ground always perform and bloom better than those held captive in small pots. A general rule of thumb is to allow 1 gallon pot size for each foot of plumeria branch / trunk length. By choosing a large enough pot, you allow more room for root growth which in turn leads to better moisture and nutrient uptake by the plant.\nPlumeria Potting Soil Mix\nPlumeria are heavy feeders and appear to do well in fertile well draining soil. A good soil mix is one that allows water to soak the rootball quickly. While retaining plenty of moisture, it must allow excess water to drain within a few minutes. The good soil mix should contain plenty of nutrients to encourage growth and blossoms on plumeria also. One soil mix that works well is as follows:\n1 part 1/4 inch bark mulch (Professional planting mix)\n1 part good potting soil\n1 part calcined clay, or pumice (or Soil Pro\u00ae 400, or perlite)\n1 part sheep manure (or cow manure)\n1 part sharp sand\n1/6 part bone meal or superphosphate (or slow release high P plant food)\nThe calcined clay I referred to looks more like Kitty Litter and may be the same stuff. It is essentially a granular product derived from sintering clay at a temperature high enough to melt the individual particles together. The product is then ground and screened into various size ranges. This material can be found as a product called Soil Pro\u00ae 400 at nurseries in Houston. I have found it (slightly less fused) as oil dry at our local Hi-Lo Auto Parts Store. If this is not available, then either pumice (1/8 to 1/4 inch particles) or coarse perlite can be used. I think pumice is readily available in garden centers in the California area. Actually, Pumice might be my first choice if it were available in Houston. The purpose of this additive is to keep the soil more porous so that water drains good. Also, the porous nature of the particles will help retain water and nutrients for the plant roots to absorb and allow oxygen to percolate through the root zone. If sheep manure is not available, I suggest composted cow (or steer) manure as the second choice. I do not have experience with chicken manure, but if it is well composted, it should work as well. The idea is to get a slow release natural organic fertilizer into the soil mix.\nOther additives can be used to round out this mix such as 1 part perlite and 1 part peat moss. A handful or two of Osmocote\u00ae with equal N-P-K numbers (or any another slow-release fertilizer) can be added to ensure slow feeding over an extended period of time. This soil mixture should also be heavy enough to help keep potted plants upright in a moderate breeze.\nLast modified February 21, 1998\nPublished over the years in the Plumeria Potpourri newsletter, the Plumeria Care Bulletins were primarily authored by Milt Pierson and the PSA Research Committee.\nIf you wish to contact Mr. Pierson, email to PSA Research Committee .\nThe Plumeria Society of America expects that you the consumer will carefully follow manufacturers label directions for all chemicals and tools.\nAsk the Experts\n"}, {"score": 614.42, "uuid": "d2f1d9bc-4744-555e-a597-45943e3ca170", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1009wb-30-27922", "target_hostname": "www.newmediaexplorer.org", "target_uri": "http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2004/01/31/toxic_teflon_frying_pans.htm", "page_rank": 1.1803442e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Toxic Teflon Frying Pans - <em>Health</em> Supreme", "snippet": "They openly admitted that the structure <em>of</em> the pans <em>is</em> <em>ceramic</em> and titanium as the sales reps will tell you, while the coating <em>is</em> PTFE (<em>plastic</em>) <em>which</em> emits PFOA (toxic gases) the same as Teflon, just a different brand name.", "explanation": null, "document": "Print this article\nToxic Teflon Frying Pans\nThe Fumes from non-stick frying pans lined with fluorine compounds such as Teflon, can be deadly to birds. We don't seem to understand that warning sign very well, although Canaries have for a long time been used to warn miners of deadly gases in the 'underworld'. A recent report available on the site of the Environmental Working Group accuses Du Pont, maker of Teflon non-stick material used in frying pans and non-stick cookware.\nIn cases of \"Teflon toxicosis,\" as the bird poisonings are called, the lungs of exposed birds hemorrhage and fill with fluid, leading to suffocation. DuPont acknowledges that the fumes can also sicken people, a condition called \"polymer fume fever.\" DuPont has never studied the incidence of the fever among users of the billions of non-stick pots and pans sold around the world. Neither has the company studied the long-term effects from the sickness, or the extent to which Teflon exposures lead to human illnesses believed erroneously to be the common flu.\nFluoride in frying pans, fluoride in the drinking water, fluoride in toothpase, fluoride in a large selection of pharmaceutical drugs.

Says It Will Fine DuPont for Holding Back Test Results - relates that DuPont did some testing on a toxic compound related to its Teflon product. The EPA is charging DuPont for withholding the test results:\nASHINGTON, July 8 - The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it would fine the DuPont chemical company for failing to report test results on a chemical related to the manufacturing of Teflon.\nDuPont conducted tests that showed that the chemical, known as C-8, was transmitted from a pregnant DuPont worker to her fetus and that traces of it were found in public drinking water in communities near DuPont facilities, but the company did not reveal that it had done the tests, the agency said.\nCongress cannot mandate such testing by a chemical company, but if testing is conducted, the results must be made public, according to the Toxic Substance Control Act.\nThe E.P.A. also found DuPont in violation for failing to provide all of the toxicological data it had gathered on the chemical after a 1997 request from the agency.\nDuPont said it would contest the fines. \"We believe that we have complied with the guidelines and the reporting requirements,\" R. Clifton Webb, a company spokesman, said.\nA spokesman for the E.P.A. said the agency would impose a multi-million dollar fine, but he declined to be more specific.\nIt is unclear whether C-8, or perfluorooctanoic acid, is harmful to humans. In one study, researchers concluded that it caused developmental defects in rats, but the results could not be replicated.\nIn 1981, DuPont had results of blood tests conducted on pregnant workers, which showed that C-8 had been transmitted from a worker to her developing fetus, the E.P.A. said. The child appeared to be normal at birth, but the agency's complaint does not say if the child was monitored thereafter.\nIn 1991, the agency said, DuPont compiled evidence that C-8 levels in drinking water in communities along the Ohio River, near the company's plant in Washington, W.Va., exceeded an exposure level set by company's internal guidelines.\nIn March 2001, a lawyer representing residents along the river in a class-action lawsuit against DuPont sent copies of the test results to the agency.\nHere is the BBC News article.\nFrying pan fumes 'kill canaries'\nBy Alex Kirby\nBBC News Online environment correspondent\nFumes given off by cancer-causing chemicals used to make non-stick frying pans are killing hundreds of pet birds every year, environmentalists say.\nThe Worldwide Fund for Nature says it is hearing reports that many US caged birds are being killed by the fumes.\nIt says the chemicals, perfluorinated compounds, are also contaminating both people and wildlife with grave effects.\nThe chemicals industry says it doubts that birds exposed to ordinary levels of the compounds could die from them.\nGuilty till proved harmless\nIn a report, Causes For Concern: Chemicals and Wildlife, WWF says the compounds, also used in some textiles and food packaging, are among \"the most prominent new toxic hazards\".\nIt says: \"Scientists have found perfluorinated compounds, classified as cancer-causing chemicals by the US Environmental Protection Agency, in dolphins, whales and cormorants in the Mediterranean; seals and sea eagles in the Baltic; and polar bears.\"\nElizabeth Salter-Green, head of WWF's toxics programme, said: \"Years ago, coal miners took canaries with them down the pits to detect lethal gases.\n\"Now, canaries are dying in our kitchens, but no action is being taken about the suspect chemicals.\n\"The global production of chemicals is increasing, and at the same time we have warning signals that a variety of troubling threats to wildlife and human health are becoming more prevalent.\n\"It is reckless to suggest there is no link between the two and give chemicals the benefit of the doubt.\"\nWWF says while the harmful effects of chemicals like DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls have been documented, recent studies of other chemicals on sale today show the dangers to people and wildlife.\nIt says: \"As well as perfluorinated compounds other harmful man-made chemicals still in use today include phthalates, phenolic compounds - such as bisphenol A - and brominated flame retardants (BFRs).\n\"Phthalates can be found in plastics (including PVC), phenolic compounds in food cans, plastic bottles and computer casings, and BFRs in fabrics and TVs.\nBrussels' approach defended\n\"These toxic compounds, which contaminate a wide range of animals, can cause severe health disorders such as cancer, damage to the immune system, behavioural problems, hormone disruption, or even feminisation.\"\nWWF says the European Union's planned legislation, Reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) does not go far enough.\nIt says Reach \"falls short of ensuring that hazardous chemicals are replaced with safer alternatives\".\nJudith Hackitt, director-general of the UK's Chemical Industries Association, told BBC News Online: \"It sounds highly unlikely to me that birds exposed to perfluorinated compounds in normal household conditions would be killed.\n\"With them and the other chemicals WWF is concerned about, the industry is spending a lot on investigating them.\n\"And with Reach, it's a big assumption to say replacement won't happen - I think it will.\"\nChemical used in coating may be making people sick\nAgency claims company withheld evidence of concerns\n(August 9, 2004)\nTeflon linked to birth defects and illness; but is it safe to use in cooking?\nDupont is facing new charges from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that it concealed research showing that pregnant workers were passing on Teflon chemicals to their unborn children. The EPA has also accused Dupont of failing to report evidence that the chemicals used to manufacture Teflon had contaminated water supplies affecting 12,000 people in the local area. Many of those affected families are suing Dupont.\nTeflon's sticky situation - By Chris Summers - BBC News Online\nIt's on saucepans, clothing, even buildings, but now Teflon - the famed non-stick chemical - is at the centre of a slippery controversy about cancer and birth defects.\nBoard: Teflon Cancer Risks Downplayed\nBy RANDALL CHASE - The Associated Press\nTuesday, June 28, 2005; 9:50 PM\nDOVER, Del. -- A controversial chemical used by DuPont to make the nonstick substance Teflon poses more of a cancer risk than indicated in a draft assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency, an independent review board has found. The EPA stated earlier this year that its draft risk assessment of perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts found \"suggestive evidence\" of potential human carcinogenicity, based on animal studies. In a draft report released Monday, the majority of members on an EPA scientific advisory board that reviewed the agency's report concluded that PFOA, also known as C-8, is \"likely\" to be carcinogenic to humans, and that the EPA should conduct cancer risk assessments for a variety of tumors found in mice and rats.\nTeflon firm faces fresh lawsuit\nBBC News, 19 July 2005 - US chemicals giant DuPont is facing a lawsuit accusing the company of failing to warn consumers about the health hazards of Teflon non-stick coatings. Two Florida law firms said they were filing the suit on behalf of 14 people who bought and used Teflon cookware. DuPont denied the claims, stating its products were safe and has vowed to vigorously defend itself. Plaintiffs want DuPont to spend $5bn to replace million of people's pots and pans and to issue Teflon warnings. They also want a fund to be created for medical monitoring of people who bought Teflon products.\nCONSUMERS BEWARE: TEFLON CAN GIVE YOU CANCER\nAfter ignoring numerous warnings from independent scientists for years, the \"nonstick\" chemical used in Teflon has now officially been categorized as a \"likely carcinogen\" by the U.S. government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA scientists found four different types of tumors in lab animals exposed to the chemical. The agency announced it plans to collect millions of dollars in fines from DuPont, the maker of Teflon, for concealing studies indicating related health and environmental risks for over two decades.\nDuPont Pays Heavy Price For Teflon Cover-Up\nDuPont's cover-up over allegations it failed to reveal the dangers of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) -- the chemical used to make Teflon -- reached closure when the company and the EPA agreed to a settlement that could amount to more than $300 million in civil fines.\nFrom: Environment News Service\nFailure to Reveal Teflon Manufacturing Risk Costs DuPont $16.5 Million\nDuPont has agreed to pay a $10.25 million fine for failing to report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk information about a chemical used in the manufacture of fluoropolymers, including some Teflon\u00ae products. Fluoropolymers impart desirable properties, including fire resistance and oil, stain, grease, and water repellency. They are used to provide non-stick surfaces on cookware and waterproof, breathable membranes for clothing. Under the settlement, filed with the agency's Environmental Appeals Board, Dupont is also committing to $6.25 million for Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), for a total of $16.5 million.\nEPA Calls For Teflon Ban\nJan 26, 2006\nConsidering all the bad news stemming from DuPont's negligent behavior regarding perfluorooctanoic acid -- a chemical used to produce Teflon -- the EPA has asked eight manufacturers to eliminate their production of that toxic substance by 2015.\nSeattle Times, Feb,08.\nNonstick chemicals may pose a threat\nThey're found in floor waxes and shampoos. They're used in many fast-food wrappers and microwave popcorn bags. They coat pizza boxes, carpets and frying pans. And they're in people. They're perfluorochemicals. While you may not recognize the word, you probably know the brand names: Teflon, Stainmaster, Gore-Tex. You are exposed to those compounds every day, and there is mounting concern that they may cause a variety of health problems. A panel of scientists selected by the Environmental Protection Agency concluded this year that a perfluorochemical used in nonstick cookware is a likely cancer-causing agent.\nToxic Teflon: Compounds from Household Products Found in Human Blood\nChemical properties that make PFCs so useful in industry also make them virtually indestructible in nature. For sheer persistence, two members of the family, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), stand out. They are not broken down by heat, light, or microbes. Other PFCs do break down, but in doing so, most of them end up giving off PFOA or PFOS. Of these two compounds' many disturbing properties, the one setting off the most alarm bells is their potential for causing cancer.\nAlternative chemicals ease safety concerns about nonstick, repellent coatings\nAmid concern about the potential toxic effects of the fluorochemicals used in nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing, and other consumer products, manufacturers are using new versions of these chemicals that may be safer.\nAlthough these new ingredients are considered sound replacements, they may only be a temporary fix, pending development of a new generation of less toxic substitutes.\nposted by Sepp Hasslberger on Saturday January 31 2004\nupdated on Sunday November 21 2010\nFluoride and IQ\nThe practice of dumping toxic-waste fluorosilicates into public water supplies in the name of fighting tooth decay has just received another damper.

And to think that I've been duped (or would that be duponted) all these years. Hoy!. Anyway, its, out with the teflon for good\nPosted by: Rod Nicholson on June 18, 2004 10:57 PM\nYesterday on December 29 of 2004 my Mothers birds were killed because she used a FARBERWARE TEFLON FRYING PAN to grill a hard roll, and the fumes KILLED ALL OF HER BIRDS!!!! The frying pan WAS NOT overheated,or scorched in any way whatsoever. The birds were in the LIVING ROOM, not the kitchen, and THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT Warning on the labeling of the cookware to signify that using this frying pan could or would harm anything muchless kill! The warning label on the pans my Mother purchased read, and I quote \"GENERAL SAFETY: Keep small children away from the stove while you are cooking. Be careful around the stove as heat, steam and splatter can cause burns. Some pets, especially birds, have extremely sensitive respritory systems and should be kept away from the kitchen.\" These were NOT OLD PANS EITHER....In fact, they were BRAND NEW, purchased about 2 weeks prior to Dec. 29th at our local Wal-Mart and used for the very first time on the 29th of December. ...AND YES, THIS IS THE ONLY WARNING AT ALL....Talk about NEGLIGENCE!!!! Call me ignorant, but I have NEVER heard of anything similiar to this happening before this happened and I began to research it. I watch the news often, but to the best of my knowledge there has never been a large public media announcement or product recalls. This is an issue which should be NATIONALLY, no, scratch that, INTERNATIONALLY covered by some Huge media resource such as CNN. I don't mean my mothers case directly, but these issues in general. When will companies begin to act with MORALE and ETHICAL REPONSIBILITY? I'll tell you when, Once the CONSUMERS have had ENOUGH. I mean, I understand that MOST INDIVIDUALS are not going to purchase a product to cook their food in that states the truth. The warning labels should be LARGE and VISIBLE and STATE: \"USING THIS PRODUCT CREATES TOXIC FUMES THAT CAN KILL YOUR PETS (especially birds) AND MAYBE HARM YOU OVERTIME.\" Because that is the TRUTH. If a product is that dangerous, which it IS, doesn't the public deserve to have that information READILY accessible so that they as the individual can decide whether or not they want to use this product in their household? Did I mention, that the \"Warning\" if that's what you can even call it, was printed in VERY TINY MICROPRINT on the BACK of the label, where it is IMPOSSIBLE to be viewed until AFYTER YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT and bring it home and open it.\nWell, needless to say I am VERY ANGRY. My poor mother has been up ALL NIGHT SOBBING OVER the loss of her Beloved pet birds, one of which was almost 21 years old, and a DEAR COMPANION to her. How can a company rectify such negligence? Pay for the birds that were killed? What about the heart break my mother is going through? What about the SUFFERING those birds must have endured while dying from those toxic fumes? What about the mis-labeling or lack of proper warning on this product that led to this situation? I can only imagine that there must be hundreds, maybe even thousands more out there that have had this happen. Our hearts go out to everyone that has had a similiar situation to this.

However, I dont recall titanium being black? Im trying to find out, so far without sucess, if they are using teflon with the titanium. some call it titanium protected. My suspicion, which I hope is wrong, is that they are using titanum which is pocketed like with moon craters, and teflon in the craters on a microscopic level. IF this is the case, the telfon will act as non stick but the titanium will protect the teflon from being scraped off.

When the study found an excess of birth defects in the children, the study was abandoned and the results filed away without notifying the federal government.

PFOA is a byproduct of the manufacturing process for creating Teflon for pans and is not present once the manufacturing process is complete. Do a little more research and stop paying tribute to the class-action lawsuit lawyers.\nThe fact of the matter is the class-action law suit is about hiding information and NOT about the chemicals, which are not even present in Teflon, being harmful. Yes, they shouldn't have shuffled the information away. But the information they hid wasn't about the use of Teflon, it was about making Teflon.\nIn addition, if you pay attention the information about those harmed by PFOA they aren't about the average individual cooking in their kitchen, it is about Dupont employees, who are exposed to the PFOA as part of the Teflon manufacturing process.\nAnd the bird issue...puleeze. Small birds are hyper sensitive to almost any chemical fume. For instance, try burning some milk in your kitchen with polly on your shoulder...the fumes from the burning milk will probably kill the bird.\nLet's not jump to conclusions. We as americans, who have an obesity rate of 65% of the population, have a lot more to worry about from eating poorly than what we do from what we cook with. Teflon isn't among the top 5 killers of American...try heart disease and cancer, as just 2 examples, that are both directly related to diet and not Teflon.\nPosted by: Phil Maloy on April 14, 2006 07:55 AM\nDo you know where I can reach HaudGuss for replacement of my pan, which at the time of purchase, was claimed to have a life time warranty .\nPlease let me know by my email - many thanks in advance.\ngarychen [at] gmail.com\nPosted by: Gary on April 17, 2006 03:46 PM\nI also need to know where to send my crappy frying pan with the lifetime warranty that my crazy husband paid a mint for.\nIt cannot be cleaned...maybe its just my cooking.\nPosted by: Kim on May 2, 2006 06:17 AM\nDoes anyone know the health concerns of cooking with Titanium objects like Scanpan?

I think it is well worth noting that although the health risk of cooking with Teflon, or PTFE, is perhaps debatable there is no debating the environmental impact of producing our non-stick pans. The slurry that is used is carcinogenic, as Shannon notes, and its pervasiveness in the atmosphere is only beginning to be understood!

Careful with this, the coating does end up sticking, or does someone have a way to restore it, please notify me. thanks\nleola\nPosted by: leola lamarche on February 3, 2008 09:44 PM\nVery interesting compilation!

Although there is a 25 yr warranty it's just not worth my time to send them back to Wisconsin. Save your money and don't buy these pans there not worth it. Now I'm going out to buy a good set of all stainless cookware. I am just tired af wasting money on these coated pans. DON'T BUY PRO HG PANS THEY ARE A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!\nPosted by: Don Herget on June 27, 2008 06:39 PM\nI have had the pro-hg stuff for 8 months and i really like it. It cooks very well. The bottoms get dirty but i don't cook food on the bottom of my pans. It's way better than the cheap crap i had before. I still use my all-clad stainless as well. Both are great.\nPosted by: Hank on August 7, 2008 02:25 AM\nmy mom bought some haudguss pots and pan and gave me two, they are the WORST PANS i have ever used and i am so mad that she spent all that money on them, they stick, something is coming off from them,its disgusting. We live in Alberta, Canada does anyone know where i can to get something done about this\nPosted by: aracely on August 25, 2008 03:43 PM\nI bought some of the Handguss pans several years ago and I am going to get my daughter some for Christmas. The best cleaning method I have found is, after dinner I put about 1/3 cup of water in the pan and put it back on the stove top. When it starts to boil I just wipe it out with a paper towel. Never had to do more then that. I know that they do scratch if you use metal utensils but if you clean them while they are hot they release any food stuff stuck on.\nPosted by: Joe on December 17, 2008 03:56 PM\nWe have just gotten off the phone with the company who manufactures the coating for Pro-HG pans for Vollrath.\nThey openly admitted that the structure of the pans is ceramic and titanium as the sales reps will tell you, while the coating is PTFE (plastic) which emits PFOA (toxic gases) the same as Teflon, just a different brand name.\nLike many of you, we bought this expensive Pro-HG pan purported to be a safe, ceramic pan. Don't buy Vollrath!\nIf anyone knows of a class action lawsuit against this company for false advertising and health risks, please post here to let me know. We are preparing a letter to our state attorney's general office and the Vollrath and Cook's Warehouse companies. Please post here if you would like me to include your name.\nAlso, please call the man who makes the plastic coating: 818-556-2740 Howard Teichman at Cooks Warehouse (the manufacturer) and express your complaints about the crooks selling you \"safe\" toxic cookware. He was not pleasant on the phone and considered these health concerns to be a laughing matter. I think some more phone calls from concerned consumers would do him good.\nPosted by: Kristin on January 26, 2009 06:22 PM\nI have a set of Pro HG pans that are the opposite of non-stick. They were a gift in 2003 and at the time I didn't care about the health risks. Now things are different and I am very interested in the risks and I am tired of having to sift bs to find what may or may not be true.\nKristin, I am interested in what you find out about this issue and I will surely give your friend Howard a call.\nPosted by: Trent on February 5, 2009 11:11 AM\nKristen says:\n\"Also, please call the man who makes the plastic coating: 818-556-2740 Howard Teichman at Cooks Warehouse (the manufacturer) and express your complaints about the crooks selling you \"safe\" toxic cookware. He was not pleasant on the phone and considered these health concerns to be a laughing matter.\"\nHoward laughed at you because you are an idiot. Cook's Warehouse is just that--a warehouse! They sell cookware to restaurants and sell the Pro-HG series (a Vollrath product) at fairs, home shows, etc. There is NO Teflon in the Pro-HG pans!\nNow that that is said, ALL non-stick pans have some type of PFC--like PTFE (Teflon)--in them. The concern is with PFOA--specifically with c8 of PFOA. PFOA is not present in the Pro-HG series. PFOA boils at 189 degrees centigrade and the Pro-HG finish is baked on at 400 degrees centigrade. Even if there were PFOA's to begin with (there are not), they would boil away during the manufacturing process.\nPro-HG pans (and their slightly less expensive and cheaper made cousins Ameriware from Costco) are the ONLY non-stick pans certified for use in restaurants by the NSF. The reason is they do not start out with any PFOA and there is no PFOA present in the final product.\nWe (us professional chefs and cooks) use Vollrath pots and pans all the time (Vollrath is in over 80 of US restaurants). Pro-HG and other versions of this non-stick system ave been used to cook food you've eaten; I guarantee it! Probably far more often than you know! Do some REAL research instead of dumping some left-wing liberal rant that's as uninformed as most of the global warming crap that's going around.\nhttp://www.cookingforengineers.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=129&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0&sid=3d11c4119f37a51914f6a3e2fb6b69b3\nPosted by: Michael De Paulo on March 16, 2009 07:28 PM\nJust found out about some bake ware and cook ware through Dr. Mercola. It is non-reactive. Price may seem high to some, but seems reasonable to me. It has a fifty-year guarantee. I will save up my money to get it, and get rid of what I currently have. My family's health and well-being is worth it.\nHere's the info for it:\nBest health to you, Danalyn Merino\nPosted by: Danalyn Merino on June 25, 2009 04:28 PM\nI would like to rescind my letter to Laurelle that is above, written on Jan. 17,2006 regarding our Ameriware non-stick frying pan that we bought at Costco. The pan has not gotten scratched in the 4 years we've used it, but the reason we bought that was because the salesman/demonstrator said it didn't have Teflon or Teflon ingredients, but we learned last year that that was a lie, that this is no better. We feel duped.\nPosted by: Lucille P. Nawara on February 2, 2011 02:37 PM\nLucille, I will let both of your comments stand if that is ok with you. Meanwhile, here in Italy (and I guess in other EU countries) there is a new type of pan being phased in, as the old teflon stuff is being phased out. We are now having ceramic covering (light cream white coloring) over aluminium pans. They do not contain any teflon or teflon ingredients. Somehow the message must have gotten through to the manufacturers and they are offering non toxic pans now... Just as an example of what I am talking about http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004A5TRY6/ but, as always, do your own research on what best suits your needs.\nPosted by: Sepp on February 5, 2011 04:34 AM\nMany of us have cookware with Teflon coating and you will definitely want to get rid of it after reading this. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is the chemical, which makes things \u201cnon-stick.\u00e2\u0080?? According to some advisers to the EPA it should be classified as a carcinogen (cancer-causing substance). But instead of banning it, the EPA has decided that the companies using Teflon should make it less likely to break down and they have until 2015 to do so.\nPosted by: markuspaul on August 27, 2011 08:18 AM\nWhile buying a non stick cookware, the first thing that needs to be checked is the coating which is used.Non stick cookwares coated with Teflon is harmful for Human Body. It has a substance called Carcinogen which can initiate cancer. There are several coating which are 100 natural.Ecolon is one of them. Neoflam is manufacturing non stick cookwares coated with Ecolon.\nPosted by: Brian Cox on October 24, 2011 04:30 AM\nName:\n"}, {"score": 611.42676, "uuid": "e357f687-1f1a-53ef-bd0d-5f1362c4170d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-38-17167", "target_hostname": "digital-recordings.com", "target_uri": "http://digital-recordings.com/publ/publifef.html", "page_rank": 1.2556081e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Simple &#x27;Food Rules&#x27; for Great <em>Health</em> and Long Life", "snippet": "For cooking, it <em>is</em> best to use high-quality glass and <em>ceramic</em> <em>pots</em> <em>which</em> are lead-free <em>or</em> high-quality stainless steel <em>pots</em>.

Once upon a time, all food was organically grown. Financial pressures on agriculture, the development of \"modern science\" and the application of a narrow-minded approach by some \"scientists\", led to the following changes:\ngenetic modifications to plants and animals, making them less compatible with the environment and our digestive system\ndepletion of genetic diversity of plants and animals\ndepletion of many natural compounds in soils\ndepletion of biodiversity on farms and in soils\npollution of soils, water and the food supply with various chemicals and radioactive waste\nSimple \"Food Rules\"\nThe \"Food Rules\" below are based on the conclusions from my paper \"Life on Earth - flow of Energy and Entropy\" . Food is a vehicle to deliver Energy and Negative Entropy (organization) to living organisms. Any kind of food processing increases food's Entropy, making it less valuable for the sustaining of Life, thus promoting disease and the aging process. Below are some specific rules based on this model:\nEat organic food which has not been genetically altered.\nEat food which is local and as fresh as possible. Eat foods which were familiar to your ancestors, rather than exotic foods not known in your region. Test these foods for your tolerance first if you wish to eat them. Test them item by item and then in combinations.\nEat food which is as close to the Sun as possible (i.e. low on the food chain). This usually results in much reduced levels of contaminants and fewer \"broken\" molecules which promote the aging process. Also, more food can be produced this way, therefore it is an environmentally-friendly way of eating.\nPlant sources of organic substances are better than animal sources, since they are lower on the food chain. Again, one will find fewer contaminants in plants and fewer \"broken\" molecules which promote the aging process.\nAvoid the processing of foods. The most valuable benefit of food is when it is raw. If processing is required, (due to viruses, bacteria, parasites or to improve digestion) - short cooking in boiling water, (at 100 degree Celsius) is the safest with the least damage. Frying, BBQ, Micro-waving, baking, etc., all damage the structures of foods due to high temperatures, making them less valuable. It also produces \"broken\" molecules which are then incorporated into one's body, speeding up the aging process. If one's body cannot synthesize certain molecules, it most likely cannot check them atom-by-atom for lack of structural damage. Damaged structures will be therefore incorporated into the body, speeding-up the aging process. Simple experiments on lab animals could easily prove this.\nThese ways of handling food could be called \"Low Entropy Cooking\" or \"Low Entropy Diet\". The benefits of this kind of food preparation are; money-saving, since food contains more valuable ingredients; time saving, since it takes much less time to prepare food this way; health improvement and maintenance, since this food will deliver all the required components for the body and its immune system; extension of the life span, since this kind of food will slow the aging process (by about 20% to 40% in my estimation).\nEat moderate amounts of food and divide it into 5 small meals a day. In this way, your body will digest and absorb food more thoroughly.\nDo not mix too many foods at once. Certain foods go well together and promote better digestion.\nEach meal should be well-balanced and should contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, proteins, oils, enzymes, water, etc.\nAvoid foods which use cheap, non-organic ingredients and are overprocessed. These foods will have a lot of contaminants and many molecules in these foods will be damaged due to heavy processing. This will result in health problems and promote aging (as much as 20% to 40% in my estimation).\nAvoid foods containing preservatives or those that have been irradiated with X-rays, gamma and other rays. If bacteria are not eating the food, it is probably not good for you.\nYour diet should include: plant protein (whole grains and beans are the best source), various plant oils (whole grains, seeds, nuts and beans are the best source), various nuts (fresh almonds and hazel nuts are best), various types of fish which are from the ocean and are low on the food chain, vitamins and minerals, eggs, yogourt, milk and white cheese (goat's milk is the best, if you can tolerate this).\nA good diet should include 8 to 16 glasses of pure, body-temperature, well pH-balanced water per day. Contaminants such as chlorine, lead, pesticides, herbicides etc., should be removed with a good-quality water filter from reputable companies such as Doulton or Aquasana .\nThe best guide to health and a healthy diet is a book by the Canadian author Dr. Udo Erasmus, Ph.D., \"Fats that Heal, Fats that Kill\" . I highly recommend you include this book in your library.\nOrganic foods, supplements and books can be found in your local organic food stores. Always check ingredients and the source of your food as well as what kind of processing it underwent. Check also this web site for additional information.\nFoods to Avoid\nNon-organic, genetically-altered, irradiated and highly processed foods - in particular: all sorts of fast, processed foods, hamburgers and other red meats (animals are too high on the food chain), vegetables, fruits, eggs and seafood produced on non-organic farms, margarines & shortenings (hydrogenated oils - very dangerous ! Hydrogenation is a chemical process which damages the molecular structure of oils and fats, forming many toxic molecules not found in nature.), deep-fried foods, ice cream, homogenized and skim milk, non-organic and non cold-pressed oils, sweets, chocolates and pastry which are made from refined sugars, hydrogenated oils (margarines & shortenings - if margarine was better for health than butter, cows would evolve to make margarine) and non-organic and highly-processed ingredients, soft drinks which are not based on natural juices and are highly- processed, artificial sweeteners, colours etc., all should be avoided. Avoid soy and soy-derived food products. They contain food absorption inhibitors, hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, denatured proteins, solvents and aluminum. For more information look under \"Soy Alert !\" .\nContainers to Prepare and Keep Food\nThe general rule is to use containers which do not react with food and do not produce contaminants.\nThe best containers are made of high-quality glass and ceramics, which are lead-free. Some plastics and metals react with food and introduce contaminants.\nFor cooking, it is best to use high-quality glass and ceramic pots which are lead-free or high-quality stainless steel pots. Other metals like aluminum, silver, copper, lead, iron, zinc, etc. should be avoided, since they react with food.\n"}, {"score": 611.1692, "uuid": "14d75b15-f6a2-5595-8f62-dcf05d74c159", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500wb-04-31356", "target_hostname": "www.digital-recordings.com", "target_uri": "http://www.digital-recordings.com/publ/publifef.html", "page_rank": 1.2811112e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Simple &#x27;Food Rules&#x27; for Great <em>Health</em> and Long Life", "snippet": "For cooking, it <em>is</em> best to use high-quality glass and <em>ceramic</em> <em>pots</em> <em>which</em> are lead-free <em>or</em> high-quality stainless steel <em>pots</em>.

The smoke that results can lead to severe health problems. For an overview of the dangers, as well as some potential ways to reduce smoke from cooking fires, see EDN 85-1 (see content below). A special workshop on cookstove design principles will be offered the day following the ECHO Agriculture Conference in December 2008.\nIndoor Air Pollution from Cooking Fire Smoke\nBy Dawn Berkelaar\nThe majority of people in developing countries cook over open fires. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, over 90% of the population cook their food with biomass (plant material). The smoke from such fires can be a nuisance, and it can also lead to severe health problems. The Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) has issued a document called \u201cSmoke\u2014the Killer in the Kitchen\u201d that shares statistics on indoor air pollution caused by burning solid fuels like wood, charcoal, and crop residues. The document also suggests steps that can be taken to minimize health risks. Unless otherwise indicated, the information below is summarized from the ITDG document (Warwick and Doig, 2003. Download from www.itdg.org).\nDangers from Wood Smoke\nSmoke from burning biomass fuels inside the home is the fourth leading cause of death and disease in the world\u2019s poorest countries. The indoor air pollution that results from burning solid fuels kills more than 1.6 million people, mostly women and children, each year. This works out to more than three people per minute. It is a higher death toll than that caused by malaria!\nThe poor, especially poor women and children, are most affected by indoor air pollution. Of the 1.6 million people who die each year because of indoor air pollution, 56% are children under five years of age. Most of these children die from acute lower respiratory infections. Young children tend to spend most of their time with their mothers, meaning they are near the cooking fire a lot. The ITDG document states, \u201cThe impact this length of exposure has on small children is exacerbated by a number of factors. Children\u2019s airways are smaller, therefore more susceptible to inflammation. Their lungs are not fully developed until they are teenagers, so they breathe faster. Also, their immune systems are not fully developed\u2014a process that may be further delayed by malnutrition.\u201d\nAccording to the ITDG document, the United Nations Development Programme claims that \u201cthe use of poorly ventilated, inefficient stoves \u2018can have the same adverse health impacts as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.\u2019\u201d Throughout the developing world, poor people are exposed in their own homes to levels of pollutants that are 100 times higher than accepted safety levels! (see Figure 1, next page)\nIn December 1952, a smoke-laden fog called The Great Smog hung over London for six days. Deaths that resulted were estimated at 4,000. Deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia increased by seven times. Yet in developing countries, women and children are exposed to similar levels of particulate pollution for up to seven hours a day, every day.\nThe ITDG document includes a quote from a review by Professor Kirk Smith from the University of California: \u201cBiomass fuel smoke contains significant quantities of several pollutants for which many countries have set outdoor air quality standards\u2014for example, carbon monoxide, particles, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides.\u201d\nIndoor air pollution can cause illnesses including acute lower respiratory infection, such as pneumonia (35.7% of cases caused by exposure to smoke from solid fuels); diseases such as chronic bronchitis causing \u201cprogressive and incompletely reversible obstruction of the airflow\u201d; lung cancer (in China and India, around two-thirds of women with lung cancer are non-smokers); tuberculosis; asthma; and cataracts. Recently there have been many health studies demonstrating a link between indoor air pollution and illness or death.\n{mosimage} {mospagebreak title=Dangers continued}\nEven in countries whose economies are in transition, people are reverting back to the use of solid biomass fuels. With economic downturns, infrastructures sometimes collapse and people can lose access to the power grid and to cleaner fuels. In Tajikistan, where just such a thing has happened, there was a 35% increase in cases of acute respiratory infection between 1991 and 2000, largely because of burning wood indoors.\nIn addition to suffering from exposure to smoke, women carry the burden of having to find firewood or other fuel. Estimates for the time they spend collecting fuel range from two to twenty hours per week!\nA few years ago we learned of a study by Dr. Wayne Bragg and Dr. Gene Shultz, Professor Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. We contacted Dr. Shultz to find out more information. Dr. Shultz and Dr. Bragg worked with local colleagues in northeast Brazil and central Mexico. They investigated indoor air pollution in rural households, caused mainly by burning wood and other household fuels in cook stoves. They measured the concentrations of very fine particulates (that are associated with certain respiratory and eye diseases) in smoky atmospheres typical of the homes of the rural poor.\nDr. Shultz told ECHO, \u201cInstead of measuring smoke particulates at fixed locations in the home, we were interested in the particulate burden that a typical woman might breath [while conducting] a task such as preparation of a meal, using her own cooking equipment in her own kitchen, and cooking her own foods. Therefore, we asked each cook to wear a small belt-mounted battery-operated air pump that sucks room air at approximately the rate of breathing, through a flexible tube, with the opening located on her shoulder. The air was passed through a micro filter system to entrap fine particles from the room air\u2014particles that are usually deeply respired into the lungs.\n\u201cThe cook would wear this equipment during preparation of a typical meal, following her normal patterns of behavior. At times she would be hovering over a smoky stove. At other times she might be on the other side of the room cutting up food. She might even walk outside to throw something to the chickens. We did not interfere with her normal patterns of behavior. She wore the equipment just for the length of time required to complete the preparation of the meal.\n\u201cWe were interested in measuring the weight of very fine particles that she is likely to collect in her lungs during meal preparation. The particles entrapped on the micro filters were weighed by special equipment available at a world-class air pollution lab at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\u201cAs part of our program of research, we worked with a team of indigenous researchers who carried out a survey of fuel usage patterns. Typically, they would interview the cook and other members of the household in their own language to better understand the types of wood that were preferred and why, the types of wood that the cooks actually used and why, etc. In addition, the interviewers asked questions to all the members of the household about the incidence of certain smoke-related illnesses in their homes (for example, respiratory illnesses and cataracts).\n\u201cIn brief, we found a great diversity of results. Some women were able to minimize the smoke in their homes. Usually these were younger women who could walk the longer distances to gain access to less-smoky wood species. Older women often had to accept the more smoky species nearby that had been passed over by those who could walk farther.\n\u201cMost women were relatively unaware of the hazards of smoke. But, remarkably, some had figured it out on their own and had successfully enlisted their husbands with handy skills, in the tasks of cutting down on household air pollution by fixing the stove and chimney or by learning to use ventilation. These women with \"exemplary\" kitchens were definitely in the minority. We were discouraged to find that most men were unwilling to help their wives. It was [the wives\u2019] problem, not the men's problem. Also, knowledge [about] the hazards of smoke and how to mitigate them did not diffuse easily from one family to another, even when the families were closely related and in daily touch. Of course, in many cases we were dealing with those who were so poor that they had to scramble to survive. Their priorities did not include household smoke or chimney repair.\n\u201cIn Brazil we found many examples of chimney flues that exited the kitchen horizontally, or nearly horizontally, and never turned up vertically outside the kitchen wall. Thus no draft was being generated, and so no smoke was being eliminated from the kitchen. There was widespread ignorance of this simple principle in several villages, even though a very few women understood this problem and managed to avoid it.\n\u201cClearly, the problem is at least as much a social problem as a technical problem, and we are of the opinion that it is best studied and solved by interdisciplinary teams and methods.\n\u201cAlthough we aren't medics, we were aware of a high incidence of respiratory problems in children, women and elderly, even in the case of non-smokers. There was also a high incidence of cataracts in the elderly, men as well as women, since elderly men spend a lot of their time indoors. Kitchen smoke isn't confined to the kitchen. It migrates throughout the houses we saw. No one escapes it.\u201d {mospagebreak title=Possible Solutions}\nSwitching to a Cleaner Fuel\nThere are ways to reduce people\u2019s exposure to such high levels of smoke. Switching to a cleaner fuel is a good option for the relatively few people who can afford it. Examples of such fuels include liquid petroleum gas, kerosene, or biogas.\nBiogas is made from dung and other organic waste materials. It is very effective and results in a gaseous, clean fuel. In Asia, the introduction of biogas is proving very successful (with 120,000 bio-gasifiers in Nepal alone), but it is harder to introduce biogas in Africa for cultural reasons.\nRemoving Smoke from the House\nAnother good option for reducing exposure to high levels of smoke is to use well-designed chimney stoves or to use smoke hoods. These can reduce indoor air pollution by up to 80%.\nSmoke hoods and improved ventilation, introduced by an ITDG project in Kenya, resulted in a nearly 80% reduction of particulate and carbon monoxide pollution in homes. Unlike chimneys, smoke hoods are freestanding and are not attached to the stove.\nEnlarging eave spaces in a traditional house in Kenya resulted in a 60% reduction of respirable particulates. Enlarging windows did little to reduce air pollution, but windows are necessary in houses that have smoke hoods, so that air can flow through the house.\n[Ed (MLP): I have read of unexpected side effects from removing the smoke too. Examples include loss of protection from insects that harm thatched roofing material or grains stored on the ceiling, or from insects that cause human illness. I wonder if this might be true of the insect in the Andes Mountains that causes Chagas disease. It drops from the ceiling at night onto the bed and bites a person. Years later the individual might experience heart disease as a result.]\nImproved Stoves\nOf the energy from a kilogram of wood that is burned in a three-stone wood-fired stove, about 18% of the energy goes into the pot, 8% into the smoke, and 74% into wasted heat. Not surprisingly, most work on stove design has been done to improve energy efficiency and to save fuel. However, these modifications are not necessarily effective at reducing indoor air pollution. In fact, according to the ITDG document, \u201cStudies have shown a small decrease [in emissions] from certain improved stoves, although many stoves in fact increase emissions if air flow to the fuel is restricted.\u201d\nStoves that incorporate a flue or chimney are often very effective at reducing the amount of smoke in a house. Two stoves with these features are the rocket stove and the Ecostove, both of which are being used in Central America (see below for more details about these). However, there are potential problems with chimney stoves. In order to work, they need to be properly designed and installed. Sometimes they are expensive. Soot can also make them ineffective without regular cleaning.\nReducing Need for Fire\nOne very simple technology that can reduce the amount of fuel necessary for cooking is the \u201chay box.\u201d Food is heated to boiling, then it is placed in a box that has been filled with insulating material (e.g. dried grasses or crumpled newspaper). The food will continue to cook slowly. The concept is similar to that of a slow cooker. In Nairobi, the development organization Winrock found that hay boxes were proving as popular as improved stoves with women\u2019s groups. For more information about hay boxes, visit the following website: www.lostvalley.org/haybox1.html .\nIn areas that are consistently sunny, solar water heaters can be used to provide warm water (around 60\u00b0C) and this can reduce the need for fire to heat water. Solar water heaters can be made very simply from black pipe and plastic [or metal] drums painted a dark color.\nSolar cookers can also be used to reduce the need for a fire. They can be made very inexpensively (e.g. from cardboard and aluminum foil) and work by concentrating sunlight directly onto the food. They can be extremely effective, but according to the ITDG document, they have had limited success in practice. One reason for this is that, in many cultures, the main family meal is eaten in the evening, whereas solar cooking is best done in the middle of the day when the sun is highest [though combined with the hay box, this obstacle could be overcome]. Another reason for limited success is that in order to use a solar cooker the cook must work out of doors, which reduces privacy. As with many projects, solar cookers need to be developed with input from the intended users if they are to be accepted and used widely. Stan Doerr, a new ECHO staff member with years of experience in Africa, says he has seldom seen a situation where solar cooking became popular over a long term. One reason that he cited is the important social structure for women that centers around preparing food. Still, information on this type of technology abounds. The web site www.solarcooking.org/docs.htm has a wealth of information, including several designs that range from extremely simple and inexpensive to very sophisticated.\nLook for Species with Less-Smoky Wood\nDr. Schultz (whose work was described above) suggested growing and using trees with less-smoky wood. He wrote to ECHO, \u201cShrubs and fast-growing trees that create minimal smoke would be highly desirable, but little seems to be known about such species, especially about local shrub species. What is needed is something that is similar to oak (low smoke production), but grows rapidly. Local women know the best and the worst species, and where to find them. Species that do NOT contain the resinous materials that produce a lot of smoke still exist, farther from the villages. But these are accessible only by the younger women, and especially by women still able to walk long distances and who also have children old enough to walk with them and help them carry and collect fuel.\n\u201cOlder women are definitely disadvantaged. Fast growing shrubs and trees that produce little smoke when properly dried might be planted close to their homes. Although this is a bit out of my field, I imagine that the better species could be identified by interviewing women to get the common names, and using botanists in local universities to match the common names with Latin names and to identify the best propagation methods.\n\u201cIdeally, this initiative to encourage the use of better wood fuels should be matched with local efforts to repair stoves, flues and chimneys, and to arrange kitchens such that prevailing winds can be used to clear most of the smoke from kitchens. One obvious step would be to place the stove under a window on the leeward side of the kitchen [i.e. on the side toward which the wind is blowing], so air movement from the windward side of the kitchen would push the smoke out the leeward window.\u201d\nChanges in Behavior\nSometimes simple changes in behavior can reduce women\u2019s exposure to smoke. \u201cFor example, making sure that fuel wood is dry cuts emissions. The use of a pot lid can reduce the fuel consumed during simmering by a factor of three and overall emission levels by almost a half\u201d (ITDG document). Keeping children away from the fire (if possible) will reduce their exposure to smoke.\nThough not a concern in many areas of the tropics, in some places an open fire is used not only to cook meals but also to heat the home. Efficient stoves are typically well insulated, meaning that less heat will enter the room. Likewise, chimneys help remove smoke, but also conduct heat away from the home.\nITDG summarized, \u201cCooking is a deeply cultural and domestic task and communities themselves, particularly the women, must be directly involved in developing solutions that suit their circumstances\u2026.Experience has indicated that there is no point trying to dictate a solution to a community.\u201d\nWith that said, solutions have been found in different communities, and there is much to learn from them. Many, many stoves have been designed to operate more efficiently. A few success stories are highlighted below.\nThe Ecostove in Nicaragua\nThree-stone fires often result in burns; can lead to acute respiratory illnesses that are the second highest cause of death in young children in Nicaragua; and are inefficient, requiring lots of wood. The Ecostove, an efficient enclosed stove that was developed in Honduras, has been found to reduce wood consumption and smoke by half. In the Ecostove, the cooking fire is enclosed in a ceramic box encased by an insulated material (such as pumice rock). A metal griddle sits above the fire, and smoke leaves the stove via the chimney. The unit is sealed, so no air pollution enters the building. The stove works well in Central America, where tortillas are a common part of the diet. Tortillas can be cooked on the flat surface of the stove, with no contamination from smoke.\nAn article in ITDG Food Chain that described the Ecostove also shared two case studies of women who prepare and sell food out of their homes. They have benefited financially (because they need to purchase less fuel wood) and health wise (because the smoke from the fire is carried out of the house). (Cameiro de Miranda, ITDG Food Chain 31:23-25). {mospagebreak title=Kenya Project}\nKenya Smoke and Health Project\nAn ITDG project involved 50 rural households in Kenya. To reduce smoke in the house, the households were introduced to smoke hoods, enlarged eaves (to improve ventilation), windows and improved fuel-efficient stoves.\n\u201cWithout these aids, smoke particles in the air exceeded 5526 micrograms per cubic metre of smoke; with them pollution is reduced by approximately two-thirds. Personal monitors on cooks showed that exposures to [potentially toxic] carbon monoxide were reduced by 35 per cent.\n\u201c\u2019The project identified that the levels of smoke particles in these rural homes is, in most cases, more than 100 times greater than the acceptable level of 50 micrograms of smoke particles per cubic meter suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019, says Dr. Liz Bates, co-ordinator of ITDG\u2019s Smoke and Health Project.\u201d\n\u201cITDG is disseminating the ideas to urban areas in Kenya and other countries like Sudan and Nepal.\u201d (Smoke Gets in Their Eyes, Appropriate Technology)\nOther Examples of Stoves\nExposure to smoke is best reduced with stoves that have chimneys, but these stoves are not always feasible. Below are examples of some very inexpensive stoves that result in fewer emissions.\nThe Jiko is a bucket with a ceramic lining that can be made for US$2.00. Alternatively, a ceramic insert alone can be set in the fireplace and surrounded by mud and stones. The insert can be made for less than US$1.00.

What\u2019s that you say? You have no backyard or green space to grow your own food? No worries! You can still raise fresh, nutritious, homegrown vegetables just about anywhere, as long as you can find yourself some sturdy, simple containers. Container gardening is an easy, enjoyable way to grow your own vegetables, and can be done on a windowsill, patio, balcony, doorstep, or any space that will provide sufficient sunlight and ease of care.\nThe best part is, almost any vegetable that will grow in a typical backyard garden can also do well in a container. Some vegetables that are well-suited for container gardening are tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, bush beans, lettuce, spinach, summer squash, radishes, and herbs. Other vegetables that can do well in containers if the conditions are right are cabbage, kale, broccoli and cauliflower.\nWhen making the decision to container garden, you will want to think about many of the same things you\u2019d be thinking about if you were gardening on a piece of land, such as healthy soil, adequate sunlight, enough water, good fertilizer, and thoughtful pest management. Of course, when container gardening, you will also have to think about what types of containers you will grow your vegetables in.\nAlmost any type of container can be used for growing vegetables. You can choose simple containers like buckets, baskets, tubs, or wooden boxes, or you can get creative and plant in shoes, recycled sinks and bathtubs, or even a kiddie pool. Whatever container you choose, you will want to make sure you match the type of plant you grow to the size of the container. (Big plant? Think big pot!)\nFor vegetables such as summer squash, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant, you will find that five-gallon buckets, or something similar in size, are the best fit. For vegetables like Swiss chard, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, one to two gallon containers work better. Smaller containers \u2013 about 4-6 inches deep \u2013 can be used to grow vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and herbs.\nYou\u2019ll also want to be careful about the material your container is made of. Containers are either porous or nonporous. Plastic, glazed ceramic, and dark glass containers are nonporous and hold water better. Wood, unglazed ceramic (like terracotta), or papier mache pots are all porous and lose moisture more quickly. You can plant in either porous or nonporous containers, but you will need to adjust how much, and how frequently, you water your plants, and pay special attention to drainage. To aid in good drainage flow, make sure any container you use has several drain holes along the bottom edge.\nAfter you\u2019ve chosen containers appropriate to the vegetables you plan to grow, and placed your containers in the warmest sunniest spot you can find, you will need to choose a suitable growing medium. A good growing medium will hold water and provide adequate nutrients and physical support to grow healthy plants. A good growing medium must also drain well, otherwise your plants could end up in a puddle and drown! A standard potting soil that you find in your garden store should work just fine. You can add some organic compost to your soil mix for heavy feeders like tomatoes and peppers. A good estimate is to fill your container with 2/3 potting soil to 1/3 organic compost.\nOnce you\u2019ve got your containers filled with healthy soil, you can either direct seed or transplant healthy, strong, seedlings into your containers. What comes next is the usual care and attention you would pay to any of your plants \u2013 regular watering, feeding and some good old fashioned TLC.\nTroubleshooting for Container Gardening\nBe mindful of over watering. Make sure your soil is like a damp sponge. Once your plant is fully grown, it is OK to let it go a few days without watering. Be careful that plants in porous containers, like ceramic pots, don\u2019t dry out too much, though. Wrapping a moist towel around the pot sometimes helps. Watch for poor drainage due to inadequate drain holes or compacted soil. It\u2019s never too late to drill more holes. Finally, keep an eye out to make sure your plants aren\u2019t outgrowing their pots. This is a sure sign that the pot may have been too small to begin with, which is why choosing the right container is so important.\nJust like any other kind of gardening, container gardening is an adventure, with lots of unexpected twists and turns not always predicted on your road map. However, you can be successful at container gardening if you are attentive and observant.

By growing fruits in containers, you have the opportunity to move plants to a sheltered spot for the winter -- and work around problems such as poor soil .\nThere's a different set of guidelines to growing fruits indoors, such as in a greenhouse, cool basement, or sunny windowsill. Many of these plants need pampering and more effort than the average houseplant. Follow these tips and you'll be on your way to having fresh fruit grown in your home.\nChoose the Right Container\nBefore selecting a container, consider your needs. Think about size, durability, and weight. Smaller plants can grow for a couple of years in a traditional 8-inch-wide container; larger varieties may need to be moved to increasingly larger containers until they're in 36- or 48-inch-wide pots. Keep in mind that the bigger the container, the harder it is to move.\nThere are many options for containers, and advantages and disadvantages to every choice. Terra-cotta, stone, and ceramic containers are durable but heavy. Wood containers are attractive and generally lightweight but can rot over time. Containers are also available in synthetic materials such as plastic, polystyrene, and other modern composites. These are lightweight, long-lasting, and fabricated to resemble many kinds of materials. Whichever container you choose, make sure it has drainage holes.\nLearn more about different types of containers. >>\nPotting Mix\nContainers allow you to provide the perfect soil -- a combination of optimal aeration and drainage with good moisture retention and the ability to hold nutrients. Garden soils won't cut it in a container. They rarely drain properly, are usually too heavy, and often contain disease organisms. But there are many potting mixes specifically formulated for growing plants in containers. Many of these contain no real soil at all. Consider using a mix that has moisture-control amendments and controlled-release fertilizer already mixed in to cut down on watering frequency and feeding.\nYou can also whip up your own potting mix. For 1 cubic yard, take equal parts peat moss or composted fir or pine bark and mix in perlite, dampening the mix as you go. If you wish, add in a slow-release fertilizer to the mix. Combine by scooping the ingredients into a cone-shape pile, letting each shovelful slide down the cone. To get a thoroughly mixed product, repeat the cone-building three to five times.\nWatering and Fertilizing\nSubtropical fruits grown in containers require more frequent watering than those grown in the ground. Make sure to use enough water to soak the entire root ball. Pay careful attention when you water to the moisture that comes out of the pot. If it all seems to rush out of the drainage holes immediately, your plant has probably gone too long without water and the potting mix is shedding moisture instead of absorbing it. Add small amounts of water slowly to help the potting mix take in the moisture.\nTo compensate for nutrients lost from watering, feed plants at least once a month with a complete liquid fertilizer containing micronutrients. Many gardeners feed as often as weekly in hot-summer areas where watering is a constant chore. Start feeding in early spring and stop in late summer or early fall to avoid encouraging late growth in frost-prone seasons.\nGranular fertilizers can also be used on container plants, but they need time to dissolve before nutrients become available to the roots. A slow-release fertilizer provides nutrients over time, from weeks to months, depending on the product. It can be useful in maintaining a steady supply, but you may need to supplement with liquid fertilizer during peak growth.\nRoot Pruning\nAs your plants grow, they'll sooner or later run out of root space -- even those well adapted to containers. Without root space, the dense root ball becomes harder to water, causing stunted growth and delayed fruit production. Although it may seem drastic, pruning the roots isn't as hard as it sounds.\nStart by pruning the top of the plant by at least one-third to compensate for the roots you are about to prune. Next, remove the plant from the container and cut off one-fourth to one-third (no more than 2 to 3 inches, depending on the size of the pot) of the outside of the root ball with a sharp knife . Then place the plant back in the pot with fresh soil and water thoroughly. If done properly, it can be the easiest way to help out a root-bound plant.\nTransition from Indoors to Out\nIf you keep your subtropical fruit plant outside during the warm months and inside during the winter, you'll need to acclimate your plants to the change in growing environment. If you're putting plants outside after a long winter indoors, do it gradually. Place them in a shady spot first, then slowly expose the plants to increasing amounts of sun over several weeks to help prevent sunburned foliage.\nMove plants from outdoors to indoors at an equally slow pace. Give them less and less sun until they're ready to come inside. Before bringing a plant indoors, hose it down to wash off dust or dirt on the leaves. If necessary, spray to control pests, which will multiply when brought indoors.\nGet tips for moving your plants indoors. >>\nAdjust Care\nOnce the plants are indoors, they won't need as much water -- but don't allow them to dry out completely. They won't need much light, either, if you are trying to keep plants cool and dormant until spring. But if you are trying to ripen fruit, the more light the better. Consider supplemental illumination with artificial lights. Adjust the feeding according to how you want the plant to grow, but in general feed lightly if at all.\nThe dry heat that circulates through most homes during the cold months severely shocks plants that have been outside all summer and may cause them to lose their leaves. Do everything possible to increase the humidity around the plants: place the containers on a tray of rocks partially submerged in water; group the plants away from heat vents.\n"}, {"score": 529.6859, "uuid": "b4c38fa8-cff0-5fba-a1c3-c7eaf2c54a7e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-98-20275", "target_hostname": "www.ats.agr.gc.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/asi/5601001-eng.htm", "page_rank": 1.1887932e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Opportunities <em>in</em> the Food Markets <em>of</em> the Republic <em>of</em> Korea", "snippet": "The 20th-century art <em>of</em> Korea <em>is</em> still dominated by <em>ceramics</em>, particularly by revivals <em>of</em> interest <em>in</em> Koryo celadon and the Choson blue and white style, as well as by painting styles, all <em>of</em> <em>which</em> continue much <em>of</em> the individualism established <em>in</em> the 18th and 19th centuries.", "explanation": null, "document": "Opportunities in the Food Markets of the Republic of Korea\nAugust 2010\nX.

Culture\nA. People and Society 9\nLacking formidable land or sea barriers along its borders and occupying a central position among East Asian nations, the Korean Peninsula has served as a cultural bridge between China and the Japanese archipelago. Korea contributed greatly to the development of Japan by transmitting Chinese Confucian and Buddhist culture, art, and religion. At the same time, Korea's exposed geographical position left it vulnerable to invasion by its stronger neighbors.\nKorea is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, with its foundation dating back to the Dangun Wanggeom who was the legendary founder of Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom, near present-day Liaoning, Manchuria, and the northern Korean Peninsula. He is said to be the grandson of heaven, and to have founded the kingdom in 2333 BC.\nArchaeological research shows that Koreans inhabited the peninsula as early as the Lower Paleolithic. Following the unification of the Three Korean Kingdoms under Silla in 668 AD, Korea went through the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties as one nation until the end of the Korean Empire in 1910. Since division and establishment of the modern republic in 1948, the Republic of Korea struggled with the aftermath of the Japanese invasion (1910\u00961945) and the Korean war (1950\u00961953). However, as the standard of living and income rose considerably in the 1980s, nationwide protests led to the collapse of the authoritarian regime in 1987, and direct and fair elections have been held every 5 years thereafter. Today, it is an established pioneer of democracy in Asia.\nB. Art and Architecture 10\nKorea is noted for its unsurpassed traditions in pottery. Korean art is often a synthesis of Chinese influences and native artistic traditions\u0097such as the use of bold color, natural forms, and lively surface decoration\u0097which produced styles that, in turn, were transmitted to Japan.\nPrehistoric Period\nThe use of pottery was an important feature of the New Stone Age throughout East Asia, and this is reflected in the earliest known Korean artifacts. Coarse-bodied earthenware has been recovered from the late Neolithic period (about 3000 BC). Bronze metallurgy, transmitted from the Mongols about 1000 BC, was quickly mastered by Korean casters. Excavations have revealed bronze and iron objects, including an assortment of ritual bells, small weapons, and mirrors, all dating from the 1st millennium BC.\nThe Three Kingdoms (1st century BC - 7th century AD)\nMore is known of Korean history and art after the 2nd century BC, during the Three Kingdoms period, when China controlled the northern portion of Korea, and the south continued under native rule. Three states\u0097Koguryo (Goguryeo), Paekche (Baekche), and Silla\u0097produced art that laid the foundation for much of Korea's artistic development. Paekche, poor in mineral resources, continued the long-established pottery tradition, producing glazed funerary vessels and intricately decorated architectural tiles. Koguryo and Silla, while also contributing distinctive gray-bodied stoneware, are most famous for their metalwork, for example, the gold burial crowns worn by the Silla monarchs\u0097tall, delicate headdresses, often embellished with a profusion of small spangles and comma-like forms in gold and jade.\nThe introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century AD provided one of the most significant sources for artistic expression. Silla and Koguryo metallurgy is well illustrated by the gilt bronze statues from this period depicting Buddhist deities. The oldest examples of Korean architecture also reflect Buddhist influence. One of the Republic of Korea's renowned Buddhist temples, Pulguksa, was built in the 8th century under the royal patronage of the Silla kingdom, which formally adopted Buddhism in the 6th century.\nUnified Silla (668-935)\nThe unification of Korea under a powerful Silla monarch stimulated continued artistic growth within the native styles. The technology for highly refined, glazed stoneware was attained during this period and laid the foundation for the remarkable celadon ware of the succeeding dynasty. Buddhism continued to exert a powerful influence on Korean art, with gilt bronzes of the Three Kingdoms period joined by sculpture in gold, cast iron, and stone. Temple building proliferated, and the remains of numerous sites still exist. The Sokkuram cave temple, built high on a mountain near Gyeongju in 751, is still in a remarkable state of preservation. Evidence also remains of secular architecture, such as the oldest known observatory in East Asia. The Chomsongdae observatory, which is about 6 m high, attests to the level of scientific skill attained by the Koreans in the 7th century.\nKoryo (918-1392)\nThe last Silla kings were weak and were succeeded by the Koryo (Goryeo) dynasty. The ancient ceramics tradition reached an apogee at this time in the green-glaze stoneware called celadon; it is characterized by the distinctive color resulting from the gray clay body under a translucent green glaze and is often decorated with motifs stamped or carved onto the surface and then filled with white or brown clay. The most popular forms were vases, desk utensils, and vessels that served either secular or religious functions.\nGilt bronze and gold statuary were widely produced during the Koryo period, continuing the sculptural tradition within Buddhist art. The Koryo era is most notable, however, for other religious artifacts. Bronze architectural ornaments reveal the decorative sophistication found within temple complexes. Elaborate rituals required utensils of various kinds; the most beautiful were executed in gilt bronze or celadon. In the Koryo period, painting first gained importance, again within the Buddhist context. The remaining 14th-century examples reveal an impressive level of accomplishment, which would fully flourish in the succeeding Choson (Joseon) period.\nChoson (1392-1910)\nThe Korean government was restructured in the 14th century, and facilitated the artistic accomplishments of the Choson period. The major artistic achievements in the Choson dynasty were in two areas: ceramics and painting. The so-called punch'ong wares were highly decorated folk pottery and served both artistic and functional purposes. In contrast to this robust pottery are the delicate porcelain wares, most notably the blue and white style that was transmitted from China in the 15th century and which occurs as small vases, water droppers, and brush pots, revealing its favored status among the scholarly class.\nFrom the 15th century on, a professional painting \u0093bureau\u0094 existed in Korea. The most important works, however, were produced by amateur-scholars, a tendency found in China as well. In the early Choson period, the most influential force in Korean painting was the landscape tradition of China's Northern Song (Sung) artists. The Koreans did not adhere strictly to the Chinese styles and produced a distinct form of expression using bolder colors, freer brushwork, and subtle humor. Painting of the later Choson dynasty reflects both the conservatism of the Chinese Che school and the individualism of the Korean artists, who experimented with Zen brush painting and innovative styles in calligraphy and continued to use bright colors and lively, secular themes.\nThe 20th-century art of Korea is still dominated by ceramics, particularly by revivals of interest in Koryo celadon and the Choson blue and white style, as well as by painting styles, all of which continue much of the individualism established in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nC. Clothing 11\nAlthough most people prefer Western clothes like suits and jeans, the national costume, hanbok, is worn by many during national holidays. Traditionally, people wore white clothes, reserving colors for the upper class or during festive occasions. Rubber shoes and sandals have been replaced by designer shoes and sneakers; however, even these are removed when entering a house or other area where shoes are not permitted.\nD. Religions and Philosophies 12\nAccording to 2005 statistics compiled by the Korean government, approximately 46.5% of the Korean population express no religious preference. Of the respondents who indicated a religion, 29.3% are Christian (18.3% profess to be Protestants and 10.9% to be Catholics), 22.8% are Buddhist, and the rest adhere to various new religious movements including Jeungism, Daesunism, Cheondoism, Taoism, Confucianism and Wonbuddhism.\nII. Historical Economic Development 13\nThe economic history of Korea may be divided into three periods: 1) before 1910 when the economy was stagnating; 2) the colonial period from 1910 to 1945 when the country started to develop a modern economy; 3) the post colonial years when living standards in the Republic of Korea improved rapidly while in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, macro-economic mismanagement and political oppression resulted in a drop in living standards.\nFrom 1392 to 1910, the Choson dynasty ruled Korea. The economy was more of a subsistence economy than a market economy. Taxes were collected in kind and in the form of labour to produce the products and services needed. This was basically a command economy where the government was organizing the production of the goods and services needed by the population. Invading armies from Japan and China destroyed this system and a market economy slowly developed out of necessity. Eventually the government minted copper coins as a form of money. Population stopped growing about 1800 and leveled off for about a century due to high mortality. During this period powerful landowning families controlled minor or ailing kings, reducing the state to an instrument serving their private needs. Land ownership was not registered and could not be guaranteed. Wages, rents and taxes fell producing budget deficits. Land and labour were being used inefficiently and water control disintegrated. In 1894 peasants protested against taxes imposed by local administrators and this quickly developed into a nationwide rebellion. In order to quell the rebellion, the government called on China and Japan to send military forces. As a result the Sino-Japanese war was fought on Korean soil. Japan defeated the Chinese forces.\nIn 1876, Japan had forced Korea to open its borders to trade and virtually annexed Korea in 1905. This was formalized in 1910. The old policies resulting in a stagnating economy were replaced by the social and economic developmental policies of the Mejii (later the Taisho and early Showa) government of Japan. Major infrastructure projects were undertaken which integrated product and input markets. Health campaigns were introduced. Education was modernized and strengthened. The cadastral survey modernized and legalized property rights to land. This increased the efficiency of land use and tax revenues. The colonial period had mixed results: per capita grain consumption declined but per capita real consumption of non-grain and non-goods consumption increased. The population was receiving a better education and living longer.\nAt the end of the Second World War in 1945, two governments emerged in Korea. The U.S. military government took over the southern half of the country while communist USSR set up a Korean government in the northern half. The de-colonization from Japan and division of the country caused much economic turmoil. In the south, the U.S. military government privatized / repatriated ownership of properties previously owned by the Japanese government and civilians. The first Korean government in the south was established in 1948 and redistributed land in a more egalitarian manner. In 1950 the Korean War broke out causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths and destroying about 25 percent of the country's capital stock in three years.\nThe Korean War ended with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty and the south has been developing with the uncertainty of a possible attack from the north. The government set out to stimulate the economy by promoting domestic industrial firms. Selected firms in certain industries were given privileges to buy foreign currencies and to borrow funds from banks at preferential rates. It also imposed tariffs and prohibitions on manufactured imports base on the concept of import substitution and the \u0093infant industry\u0094 argument for trade protection. Corruption increased and there was more interest in obtaining revenues from the government rather than the market. The result was falling efficiency and stagnating living standards. Eventually the civilian government collapsed, replaced in 1960 by a second short-lived civilian government.\nIn 1961, a military government came to power under Park Chung-hee a former officer in the Japanese Imperial army and modeled his policies after the zaibatsu system in Japan during the Meiji Era. The result was the development of the chaebols 14 of the Republic of Korea and a shift in development emphasis from import substitution to export promotion. Exporting companies were given favours and privileges that only domestic oriented companies previously received. Perhaps the most significant privilege was access to loans at very favourable rates. The discipline of the international market considerably increased the efficiency of exporting industries. The chaebols grew large but were not always profitable. The favourable rates often lead to heavy debt burdens that could not be carried during economic downturns. Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979.\nAPPENDIX 2\n1. Canada - New Zealand /US - Measures Affecting the Importation of Milk and Exportation of Dairy Products\nA. The WTO Rulings\nOn the basis of challenges from New Zealand and the United States, the WTO ruled in 1999 that certain Canadian dairy exports benefitted from export subsidies under the rules of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Thus, they were subject to Canada's WTO export subsidy reduction commitments. Since exports exceeded those commitments, Canada was found to be in breach of its obligations. The milk sales affected by the WTO ruling accounted for about four per cent of total Canadian production. The WTO ruling did not prevent the export of dairy products as Canada is allowed to use export subsidies for dairy products within specified limits (see Table 21). Canada's Measures to Implement the 1999 WTO Ruling.\nCanada unsuccessfully appealed the Panel's Report - in its Report in October 1999, the WTO Appellate Body upheld the Panel's key findings. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted these findings, and recommended that Canada bring its measures into conformity with the WTO rules.\nNew Zealand and the United States then reached an agreement with Canada in December 1999 on the time-frame for Canada's implementation of the outcome of the case. This agreement provided for a \"phased\" implementation over the 2000 calendar year. As part of its implementation, Canada would continue to make use of the \"Special Milk Classes\" scheme for dairy exports, but agreed to limit export volumes under the scheme to within its commitment levels.\nHowever as part of its implementation, Canada introduced a number of new dairy export mechanisms on a province-by-province basis. Canada claimed that the new schemes did not provide export subsidies, and it would not therefore limit the volume of exports under them to within its export subsidy commitment levels. New Zealand and United States officials considered that the new schemes continued to provide export subsidies and that Canada had therefore failed to comply with the Dispute Settlement Body's recommendations.\nIn February 2001, New Zealand, the United States and Canada held consultations on this issue, but failed to resolve New Zealand's and the United State's concerns. Consequently, later in February, New Zealand and the United States formally requested that the WTO reconvene the original dispute settlement Panel to examine Canada's replacement schemes. The Panel received written and oral submissions from the parties in May 2001 and in July 2001, found that Canada's replacement schemes continued to provide export subsidies in breach of its WTO commitments.\nCanada subsequently appealed this decision and in December 2001 the Appellate Body held that the Panel had applied the wrong legal test to determine whether export subsidies had been provided. The Appellate Body also determined that it was unable to make any determination as to whether the Canadian measures were export subsidies since further factual information was required before the correct legal test could be applied.\nFollowing the December 2001 Appellate Body ruling, New Zealand and the United States requested, for a second time, the reconvening of the original dispute settlement Panel to examine Canada's replacement measures against the legal test outlined by the Appellate Body. The Panel received written and oral submissions from the parties in March and April 2002 and in July 2002. the Panel, once again, found that Canada's replacement schemes continued to provide export subsidies in breach of its WTO commitments.\nOn 23 September 2002, Canada notified its decision to appeal the Panel decision. Following receipt of written submissions of the parties, the Appellate Body heard the appeal in Geneva on 31 October 2002. In its report of 20 December 2002 the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that Canada was providing export subsidies in breach of its WTO commitments. The Appellate Body found that Canada's replacement scheme was contrary to Canada's obligations under Article 3.3 and Article 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The Appellate Body's decision was adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body on 17 January 2003.\nAt the same time as initiating the dispute settlement process to investigate Canada's compliance with the original panel's finding, New Zealand also lodged a request seeking authorisation from the Dispute Settlement Body to take retaliatory action against Canada by suspending tariff concessions up to the value of US$35 million a year, which is the damage calculated to be caused to New Zealand by Canada's illegal dairy export subsidy regime. The US also made a similar request to the Dispute Settlement Body. The requests of New Zealand and the US were referred to arbitration. A mutually agreed solution between Canada and New Zealand and separately between Canada and the United States was notified to the WTO on 9 May 2003.\nB. The Mutually Agreed Solutions\nTable 21.

confusion as we attempted to negotiate the Turkish public transportation system to get to Ankara in order to meet up with our cultural exchange group.\u00a0 Kadir's took us as far as the main road in their luxury complementary mini-bus, then we caught the dolmus , which is a generic term for one of the hundreds of mini-buses that navigate the roads around the country, providing quick transportation between spots, usually no more than an hour's drive apart.\u00a0 We settled in for the packed, non-air conditioned ride to Antalya.\u00a0 My seatmates were a man and his little daughter, who started the ride off with a bang by throwing up.\u00a0 Her mother must have anticipated this, because she quickly handed over a small plastic bag, which got quite a workout during the hour-long ride.\u00a0 Once in Antalya, we boarded a big, modern bus for Ankara, which was eight hours away.\nWiley found LISLE on the Internet.\u00a0 Affiliated with the University of Toledo, LISLE was formed shortly after WWII with the charter of facilitating understanding between people of different cultures.\u00a0 The idea is that if you can get people talking to each other, and understanding that we're all really not so different after all, you can, on something of a grass roots level, foster peace and friendship among the people of the world.\u00a0 Fundamentally, I completely agree with this concept, because it seems to me that if you know someone on a personal level, and if you have some concept of the challenges they face in their day to day life, if you experience their traditions and customs, and if they reciprocate by showing an interest in yours, it's pretty much impossible to feel indifference about them.\u00a0 We wanted to do some volunteer work somewhere while on the trip, and LISLE promised the opportunity to do just that while in Turkey, in addition to participating in personal exchanges with Turkish people.\u00a0 The first week of the three week trip would be spent visiting various sites around Ankara and in the Cappadocia region, the second staying in the home of a Turkish family in the city of Gazientep, and the final four or five days resting, relaxing, and sunning on the Mediterranean coast.\nI had communicated with the group leaders, Leyla and Ray Welkin from Olympia, Washington, via email several times.\u00a0 Not knowing what time we'd get into Ankara, I had told Leyla that we would meet them at the hotel on Thursday morning.\u00a0 On Wednesday night we rolled into the Ankara bus station, which was bigger than the airports in many mid-size American cities, and asked several cab drivers if they knew the hotel we were trying to get to.\u00a0 Of course, they all said that they knew it, and luckily I was paying attention as the cab flew by the place and told him to turn around.\u00a0 As we walked up to the building, which looked less and less like a hotel the closer we got, a man approached us and in broken English asked us what we were looking for.\u00a0 We showed him the piece of paper with the name of the place we were staying, which was the Koy Hizmetleri Genel Mudurlu Guest House.\u00a0 By this time I was pretty sure we must be at the wrong place, and we were pretty much in the middle of nowhere, but he told us to follow him, and led us through a guarded gate.\u00a0 We entered the lobby of a building whose architecture could only be categorized as belonging to the Late 60's College Dormitory school, and found that with our new friend gone, no one spoke English.\u00a0 We invoked the Welkin's name, we invoked the name of our Turkish guide, Filiz (whose last name we didn't know), we invoked the name of LISLE - nothing worked.\u00a0 Finally, someone offered us tea, the essential fluid of the Turkish social machine.\u00a0 Turks can't do anything without tea - the ones I spent time with seemed to need at least one every two hours.\nEventually, we were given a key to a room, the look and smell of which completed the college dorm picture.\u00a0 Whatever - we were just happy to be somewhere, and we were pretty sure that it was the place we were supposed to be, so that was even better.\u00a0 We went downstairs, after looking up the Turkish word for restaurant, and said \"Lokanta?\" to the first apparent employee we encountered.\u00a0 A woman overheard us, and motioned for us to follow her into the restaurant.\u00a0 We assumed that she was an employee, but when she escorted us to her table and introduced us to her male companion, we knew differently.\u00a0 It just so happed that there was a circumcision party going on in the restaurant that night.\u00a0 Turks circumcise their sons at age ten (ouch!), but the surgery itself is preceded by a day of partying that includes allowing the circumcisee to request anything from his parents and have it delivered.\u00a0 Not a bad deal, I suppose.\u00a0 The little boy who was celebrating that night, and I have to assume that he hadn't actually visited the doctor yet, since he seemed pretty chipper, wore a spiffy white tux with tails and was enjoying boogying the night away.\u00a0 Meanwhile, we were feeling completely out of place, as we were still dressed in shorts and t-shirts after our eight-hour bus ride.\u00a0 Our tablemates had taken us under their wings, and although they spoke no English, they began to fill our plates with the food from theirs, despite our protests.\u00a0 This is the Turkish way.\u00a0 Guests are treated with the utmost respect and deference, and people who invade your dinner table are apparently no exception.\u00a0 We managed to get some dinner ordered, and tried to make conversation with our tablemates, using the guidebook's rudimentary English/Turkish dictionary.\u00a0 It was an interesting night.\nThe next morning we met Leyla and Ray.\u00a0 We ate breakfast while they explained that much of the trip might be somewhat unstructured, and that we might spend a good deal of time paying our respects to various government officials and drinking tea.\u00a0 That afternoon the remainder of the group convened, and the makeup was as follows:\nLeyla and Ray, and their sons Evan (15) and Avery (13).\u00a0 Leyla is a psychologist who just quit her practice in frustration over managed care, and will begin teaching in the fall.\u00a0 Ray manages the Waldorf School in Olympia.\u00a0 Waldorf is an educational system founded on the principles of Rudolf Steiner, an eccentric scientist/philosopher from Germany who espoused somewhat far-out ideas about farming, education, and utopian societies.\u00a0 Evan finished up there last year and Avery has two more years.\nDeb Marois from Sacramento, California.\u00a0 Deb works with grass-roots organizations in and around Sacramento to help them develop various health education programs, especially those geared towards women.\nDebbie Sobeloff from Bethesda, Maryland.\u00a0 Debbie just moved back to Bethesda and plans to do some substitute teaching while beginning a career in writing.\u00a0 A veteran of two LISLE trips, Debbie had just returned home from a 5-week retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh in the French wine country (see Books We've Read for more on Thich Nhat Hanh).\nVickey McNeal from Griffin, Georgia.\u00a0 Vickey's accent dripped with Southern flavor, like a slice of chess pie.\u00a0 It made me homesick to hear her talk.\u00a0 Vickey teaches in a school for children who have disciplinary problems in Griffin.\u00a0 She can't wait to retire next year and fulfill her passion full time - world travel.\nPatty Summa from Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u00a0 Patty teaches 8th grade history in Cambridge, just outside of Boston (and home to Harvard).\u00a0 Patty ran the Boston Marathon as a renegade a few years ago, so we talked incessantly about running until we bored everyone around us.\nSally Butler from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Sally is a grade-school counselor and an extremely young grandmother of twins.\u00a0 She also possesses a deadly dry wit which kept me laughing during the whole trip.\nWe also had a Turkish guide, Filiz, who arranged our first week in the Cappadocia region of Turkey, which is her home.\u00a0 She teaches archeology in college in the town of Neveshehir.\u00a0 Our group, although decidedly female, was extremely diverse and easy-going.\u00a0 Given the somewhat tedious nature of some of our days during the trip, the good nature of the group allowed us to survive.\nI'm pretty sure we weren't prepared to assume the new roles of \"group tourists\".\u00a0 For nearly six months we had been doing pretty much exactly as we pleased, and group travel demands that each member function as a unit of the group, not as an individual.\u00a0 When people in the group need money, the whole group must participate in the exercise of going to the bank.\u00a0 When members of the group need to get laundry done, everyone must go to the same place.\u00a0 You can't say, hey, I need to get some money, let's detour the van to the bank of my choice and have everyone wait while I take care of my needs.\u00a0 The trip can't work that way.\u00a0 So we had to change our way of thinking, and it was difficult at times.\nThe plan for the first week of the trip was to visit the Museum of Anatolian Civilization in Ankara, then head for the town of Mustaphapasa, which would be our base of exploration for the Cappadocia region.\u00a0 The museum was very well done and extremely fascinating.\u00a0 There were extensive displays of rock carvings, cooking vessels, jewelry, and ceremonial articles from the ancient Hitite culture.\u00a0 I vaguely remember the Hitites being mentioned in the Bible, but never knew too much about them.\u00a0 They thrived in Turkey from 1900 to 1300 B.C., and had quite an extensive civilization.\u00a0 Even more fascinating were the 8000 year old cave paintings from the Neolithic civilization at Catal Hoyuk.\u00a0 Archeologists have been carrying out extensive excavations at this site for almost 80 years, and have found layer upon layer of houses and other buildings.\nWe also visited the tomb of King Midas while in Ankara, which turned out to be, more than likely, the tomb of King Gordias, but I don't think the people who run the place are in any hurry to clear up the misconception, since everyone has heard of King Midas and almost no one has heard of King Gordias.\u00a0 The interesting thing about this place was that the interior of the tomb was constructed with wood, and that wood has survived for some 6000 years!!\u00a0 It's still wood today - not petrified wood, and it looks like it was built last week.\u00a0 Historians believe it may be the oldest wooden structure in the world, and I was amazed, especially since we couldn't keep the carpenter bees out of the arbor on our deck for more than one year.\u00a0 I found it interesting to reflect on the similarities of some of the burial rituals we have seen amongst ancient civilizations - the Egyptians, the Incas, the Mayans, and now the Gordians.\u00a0 They all thought it important to entomb the bodies of rulers in preparation for the next life, and often buried them in elaborately built buildings, with articles from daily life that they might need in the next world.\nIn Ankara we had the first of many conversational encounters with Turkish people.\u00a0 We met two of Filiz's friends who are active in the women's rights movement, a movement which is in its infancy in this country.\u00a0 One woman was a psychologist who works with women and children who have been physically and/or sexually abused, and the other was a chemical engineer.\u00a0 They were both extremely intelligent, and it was very interesting to learn about the political climate in Turkey today, especially as it applies to women.\u00a0 As a very male-dominated society, Turkey still has a long way to go with respect to even the basic needs of the female portion of the country.\u00a0 Even though Turkey gave women the vote before most European countries and the United States, there are still many inequalities that exist, and most people feel that in reality, women are still an oppressed minority in Turkey.\nCappadocia Region, Turkey\nJuly 7 through July 16, 2000\nThe Cappadocia Region of Turkey is probably the most visually stunning area of the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three volcanoes combined forces more than 10 million years ago to spread the area with a thick layer of volcanic ash.\u00a0 This ash hardened into a soft, porous stone called tufa, and millions of years of wind and rain shaped the stone into the chimneys, pinnacles, and mounds that\u00a0 make Cappadocia resemble a moonscape.\u00a0 In addition to the amazing natural formations of the area, people have hewn homes and churches out of the soft rock for many centuries, and even built entire cities as many as 40 stories below ground when enemies threatened.\nFiliz lives in Nevsehir, so she knows the area well, and wanted to show us many things.\u00a0 Because of this, we spent eight days in Cappadocia, when in reality, three or four would probably have been plenty for me.\u00a0 Everywhere we went, Filiz knew somebody, and more often than not, we were invited to drink tea with them.\u00a0 I mentioned above that tea is very important in Turkish social life.\u00a0 It's considered rude not to offer a visitor tea, and reciprocally, it's considered rude not to accept tea when it's offered.\u00a0 Filiz had arranged for us to meet several local dignitaries as part of our \"cultural exchange\", and each and every one offered us at least tea, and sometimes also soft drinks and lunch.\u00a0 Some of these encounters were very interesting.\u00a0 The guys we met with were local officials, regional governors, mayors, and police chiefs.\u00a0 Some of them expressed some pretty lofty thinking for small-time Turkish government employees.\u00a0 A couple of them talked about facilitating cultural understanding between people of different countries, and how it's really the only way to ensure peace among nations.\u00a0 Others talked about the environment, and the need to preserve and protect.\u00a0 One even talked about a program he was putting into place to support women who are in difficult marriages (It's still legal in Turkey for a man to publicly denounce his wife for no good reason, and leave her penniless).\nOne of the officials we met with spoke a good bit of English, as the Turkish government had sent him abroad to England to study for a year.\u00a0 Bilal Olmez seemed to have two modes of communication: constant talking or loud, uncontrolled laughter.\u00a0 He asked us lots of questions, ranging from whether we believed in the existence of UFO's to what, if any, tips we had for him about investing in the New York Stock Exchange.\u00a0 When we asked him what we could do to facilitate his efforts to bring education and technology to the young people of his area, he responded that he felt that one of the most important things that the children in the area could learn was how to speak English.\u00a0 Turkish children receive several years of schooling in English, but getting extra resources for the training is sometimes difficult.\u00a0 He asked that if possible, we send any type of English books, magazines, and newspapers, to help with English instruction.\u00a0 I thought this might make a great project for some of our readers, especially the children, so here's where to send books:\nBilal Olmez\nKozakli\nNevsehir, Turkey\nInclude a note that says that you heard about his desire to receive English reading materials through an American friend that participated in the LISLE Cultural Exchange program.\nAlong with the interesting cultural encounters that week, there were some strange ones.\u00a0 I mentioned above that one of the reasons we chose this trip was that there was to be an opportunity to do volunteer work.\u00a0 Different things were mentioned, but one of the things we latched on to, and were excited about, was the possibility of helping archeologists at an active dig.\u00a0 We knew it would be grunt work, and that we probably wouldn't uncover the Rosetta Stone or anything like that, but it sounded like fun.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this was where we encountered one of our \"cultural differences\" with Filiz.\u00a0 The Turks wanted to treat us like respected dignitaries, and having us do work would have gone against that.\u00a0 They were also concerned that we might get sick in the heat if we did anything outdoors, which was probably a valid concern.\u00a0 All this contributed to the difficulty of getting a project set up, and what finally served as our volunteer opportunity ended up being nothing short of hilarious.\u00a0 Having been told that we were concerned about the environment, one of the local mayors we met responded that he'd be happy for us to paint his water treatment plant.\u00a0 So, armed with brushes and buckets of whitewash, we attacked the plant with a vengeance.\u00a0 Our cheerfulness quickly diminished once we learned that we not only had to paint the small building, but also the large water holding tank.\u00a0 And let me just take a moment here to correct a major misnomer that people like our good friend Steve Ernst, owner of a water company, perpetuate.\u00a0 It's not a \"water\" treatment plant, it's a \"sewage\" treatment plant, and it certainly smelled like one.\u00a0 The wind was particularly fierce that day, and no location was safe from the smell of the local wastewater.\u00a0 Despite the circumstances, the group pulled together and finished the job, and managed to laugh hysterically many times in the process.\nDuring the week in Cappadocia, we had some really good experiences.\u00a0 Among them were visiting the Open Air Museum in Goreme.\u00a0 I told you above that people have lived in this area for centuries, fashioning their existence out of the rock formations, carving a new room out of the rock when a new baby is born. The Open Air Museum is a concentrated area of dwellings and churches, and it's amazing.\u00a0 You walk around this place and wonder out loud if these people ever looked around themselves as they went about their daily lives and said, \"Man, this is a wild looking place!\u00a0 I can't believe I live in that cave over there!\".\u00a0 The churches are even more incredible, with dramatic wall paintings that ranged from primitive to extensive, rivaling anything I've seen in Rome or elsewhere.\u00a0 The primitive paintings are especially interesting, with some of them calling to mind a time when early Christians in the area may have combined worship of the Holy Trinity with a more naturalistic bent, as their lives revolved around and depended on nature and its whims.\nOne of the most bizarre and perhaps embarrassing cultural exchanges of my life occurred the night we attended a local wedding celebration.\u00a0 In Turkish culture, there are a couple of parties that lead up to the wedding, maybe sort of like our rehearsal dinner concept.\u00a0 We attended the henna party, which is the event at which the bride's hands and feet are decorated with henna, the green powder that, when mixed with water, makes a temporary brownish-red dye.\u00a0 I've heard several stories about just why this is done, but I think it's supposed to ensure fertility for the bridal couple.\u00a0 At the party we went to, which was in a small village about 30 minutes from where we were staying, the bride sat in the middle of a cluster of approximately 200 women, young and old.\u00a0 Occasionally the bride's friends danced around her, and the entire time these women just sat and watched.\u00a0 Someone told me that one of their purposes in being there is to check out the local girls as potential wives for their sons and brothers.\u00a0 The really embarrassing aspect of this thing for me was that, as the tourists, we were escorted to the center of the cluster (Turkish hospitality at work again) in order to meet the bride.\u00a0 This ensured that everyone there got a good look at us, and that we obstructed their views of the proceedings, for which several loudly complained.\u00a0 While we women were making spectacles of ourselves, the men were hovering on the fringes of the group.\u00a0 Wiley, Evan, and Avery made friends with several of the local boys, and at one point we looked over and saw Evan choking down the first cigarette of his life.\u00a0 He also took a turn shooting one of the boy's pistols, something else he had never done.\u00a0 We all found it quite ironic that a boy from the supposed mean streets of America had to come to Turkey to get a chance at shooting a gun.\nAnother amazing attraction in the Cappadocia region was the underground city.\u00a0 Apparently, there are several in the area, and the one we visited was a system of cool, labyrinthine tunnels, punctuated by rooms used as schools, churches, wineries, stables, and storage areas.\u00a0 When enemies invaded, the people of the region went underground, coming up only to tend their crops.\u00a0 It was somewhat suffocating being eight floors underground (the city goes for some forty stories below ground, but safety concerns keep the tourists from going that far below), and I couldn't help but wonder how people were able to spend weeks and months below ground like that.\u00a0 There was plenty of fresh air, thanks to an extensive system of ventilation shafts, and the temperature hovered around 55 degrees, which was entirely preferable to the ground level readings, but we all agreed that we were pretty sure we wouldn't survive long down there.\u00a0 However, I guess you can do anything if you must, especially if your survival is in question.\u00a0\u00a0 We even hear that people in America are eating rats to survive, but that's another story, and one we're pretty sure we don't mind missing out on.\nWe had an marvelous hike in the area on our last day in Cappadocia.\u00a0 Once I had seen those rock formations up close, I realized that I hadn't fully appreciated the beauty of the area before.\u00a0 We scrambled up and down hills amid groves of shady apricot trees, laden with delicious ripe fruit.\u00a0 At one point we crossed a deep gully and climbed up into a cave to discover that it was one of the many hidden churches used by early Christians in the area.\u00a0 The soft tufa facilitated carving into beautiful structures, and here in the middle of nowhere we marveled at the full and semi-domes, archways, and ornate columns in this serene structure.\u00a0 It was easy to imagine how one might come to talk to God in this tranquil setting.\nAnd then, there's the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say.\u00a0 Unfortunately, much of the week was consumed with traveling around the region by van, going from site to site, and given the brutal heat, it was miserable much of the time.\u00a0 Even though the van had air conditioning, it just couldn't compete with the intense sun.\u00a0 Also, someone contracted a stomach virus, which eventually spread to pretty much everyone in the group.\u00a0 Some of the sites we trucked it several hours to see consisted of not much more than \"holes in the ground\", as Vickey so aptly named them.\u00a0 We visited a place to buy carpets, which turned out to be a major tourist trap, and many people felt that they had been ripped off.\u00a0 When some members of the group wanted to stop and look at ceramics, which the area was famous for, we were again taken to a major tourist spot, where the prices were unapproachable.\u00a0 The highlight for me was correctly answering the presenter's question and getting suckered into demonstrating just how impossible it is to make a clay pot.\nProbably the most \"touristy\" thing we have done since leaving home in February was attending a \"Turkish Folk Show\" one night while in Cappadocia.\u00a0 Filiz knew a woman who owned this nightclub, and she had graciously offered to host the group, free of charge, for an evening of folk dancing and Turkish food and drink.\u00a0 This is the kind of activity we shy away from when traveling on our own.\u00a0 I don't know how much people were paying to attend this show, but I've always felt like you can get a better sense of local culture, food, and music, by seeking out the establishments where the locals go.\u00a0 The evening turned out to be pretty much as we expected - mediocre food and drink, and some decent folk dancing.\u00a0 The most interesting aspect of the evening for probably everybody was the oiled wrestling competition that took place first.\u00a0 Oiled wrestling is serious sport in Turkey, having been around for over 1000 years.\u00a0 The month we were there a big championship festival took place.\u00a0 The competition worked this way:\u00a0 four muscular men entered the ring, which is a large grassy area, and then proceeded to make themselves good and greasy with vast quantities of olive oil.\u00a0 After some type of posturing activities, which included much slapping of hands on thighs and checking down their opponent's pants for weapons, they then paired off into twos and tried to pin each other, face up, to the ground.\u00a0 The holds that the wrestlers used were unlike anything I had seen before - not that I'm an avid student of wrestling, but I've watched my share during the Olympics.\u00a0 In oiled wrestling, it's apparently quite legal, if not encouraged, to plunge your hands down your opponent's leather britches in an attempt to get a good hold on something.\u00a0 Since we couldn't see what the wrestler's hands actually did while they were down his opponent's pants, we can only speculate.\u00a0 It was all good fun, and certainly quite a bit of it was staged, including the part where two of the wrestlers fell to the ground right in front of me, and one of them grabbed my foot in an attempt to make me part of the battle.\nAll in all, it was a fascinating but tiring week.\u00a0 After five months of setting our own pace, we found it tough to adjust to an 8 - 7 schedule.\u00a0 We were optimistic about the next phase of the trip, which included five days staying with local families in the city of Gaziantep.\u00a0 On Sunday we got up bright and early for a seven hour drive, and eagerly awaited meeting our hosts for the week.\n"}, {"score": 521.8042, "uuid": "abef66ce-850d-55cd-8896-5a5e1a4773a3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-28-12164", "target_hostname": "wiki.answers.com",

A handy formula for creating container gardens has made the circuit for years now - the \"Thriller-Filler-Spiller\" design with a tall plant in the center, something full and colorful in between and a vine hanging over the edge. But don't worry about following the rules. Anything goes with containers these days, so try something new this year. Keep in mind, though, the basics for a healthy container garden: Good soil, good drainage, good site selection - and the right plants - will make and keep container plantings beautiful and healthy throughout the season.\nBegin with good design\nGarden design is important because a container is a garden, albeit a small one, and it needs to blend and integrate into the surrounding area. Placement of containers could be on a porch, in a woodland area, in a vegetable garden or in a flowerbed. The container itself could be a focal point, or multiple containers could be used as a flowing connection between two garden areas, living spaces or as a guide to a business entrance.\nColor themes are always popular, whether it is the tried and true red, white and blue or the cool, peaceful colors of silver, white and purple. Color combinations can set the mood for a garden container and invite people in to a peaceful, relaxing setting or grab their attention with eye-popping bold colors. Hot colors such as orange and red warm people up and stimulate their appetite. Cool colors such as blue, gray and green will keep them calm and relaxed. Container gardens are an easy way to introduce these colors into a living, working or even therapeutic area.\nLarge, dramatic containers planted with cool colors provide an elegant transition from concrete surface to the garden beyond.\nPHOTOS COURTESY OF PATTI NAGAI\nContainer basics\nChoose the container based on where it will be situated. Consider the space available, how tall the plants will be (will a trellis or other support be needed?), whether a single container or multiple containers will be used, and most importantly: How much light will the container receive during the day? Full sun is needed for growing herbs, vegetables and many of the flowering plants. Full sun is defined as greater than six hours of direct sunlight a day, which is sometimes difficult to obtain with planters under overhangs and near buildings.\nA cluster of similar containers creates a small, easy-to-maintain garden tableau.\nConsider the planter as a piece of art, or simply as a functional holder for the plants, which will then become the work of art. Use whimsical planters for children's areas. Match styles and colors to the d\u00e9cor of the home or building. Recycled containers are wonderful to use, but should be food-safe if you are growing herbs and vegetables. Metal containers are sometimes an issue due to potential lead, copper or zinc contamination. Lead is a problem for humans, but copper and zinc can create toxicity issues for the plants. Consider using a liner for metal containers.\nLarge containers that will be left outdoors all year round should be freeze resistant if your winters come with ice and snow. Many ceramic and concrete containers must be protected over the winter to keep from cracking.\nPlants will grow in most anything as long as there is enough soil or soilless mix, and there is a drainage hole. Good drainage is the key to successful container gardening. Resist the temptation to use a container without drainage holes. Use \"feet\" or a plant tray turned upside down to keep the container up off the surface whether it's soil, concrete, brick or decking material. Feet can be functional and fun, and should be promoted for use with container gardens. Pots can literally look like they have feet or claws, or the feet can simply be plastic pads or plastic triangular supports. With slight elevation, the pot will drain better, and there will be fewer problems with deck and patio staining.\nAbove, combining ornamentals with edibles saves space in a small residential setting. Below, use \"feet\" to keep the container up off the surface, whether it's soil, concrete, brick or decking material.\nWhat type of container?\nThe variety of container styles can be overwhelming, but what's also important is the container's composition.\nClay pots require a high frequency of watering, so they're great for plants that like dry conditions. Clay is very porous, and salts - and sometimes algae - may build up on the exterior and rim of the pot. These containers also are heavy and breakable.\nPlastic containers are easy to use and easy to keep clean, and they retain moisture better than clay pots. New styles look like terra cotta or glazed ceramic; and although an advantage is that they're lightweight, this means they can turn over easily. Plastic is generally not breakable, however.\nCeramic, glazed pottery retains moisture longer than unglazed pots, so make sure there is a drainage hole. Some foreign imports may be contaminated with lead, either in the clay or in the glaze.\nMetal is not recommended as a primary container for growing plants, as the metals can leach into the soil and cause toxicity problems. It's advisable to use a liner or secondary pot within the metal container. Depending on the metal, rust may develop from frequent watering. For a \"rustic\" look, however, this can be a bonus.\nProper soil is critical\nContainer gardens grow fast and furiously when provided with the right soil environment. Go organic! Use a lot of organic matter in your soil or soilless mix to increase growth and help retain moisture in the pot. Happy roots produce happy plants, beautiful blooms and more fruit! Remember the container is a limited growth environment for plants; the soil mix will make the difference in their health.\nSoilless potting mixes are generally organic, usually containing peat moss, compost and sometimes pine bark. In addition, they may have perlite or vermiculite added for drainage. Soil - real soil - adds a lot of weight to the mix, but it can certainly be included for outdoor container gardening. Adding soil to a soilless mix is great for large containers; just make sure it is clean, sterilized soil to reduce the risk of disease or insects. That additional weight in the pot may be very helpful as the summer progresses and your plants get taller and more top heavy. Extra weight also keeps containers from taking a walk late at night.\nConsider choosing edibles\nFor a different twist on container gardening, surprise your customers with colorful, edible plants. Food production in pots can be as simple as a single tomato plant in a five-gallon bucket, but adding a touch of creativity to a single tomato plant could turn it into a \"salsa garden of delight.\" Try combining 'Margherita' tomato, 'Chichimeca' jalapeno pepper and a few plants of cilantro - perhaps the All-America Selection 'Delfino' - to spice up the container's look as well as the taste.\nMaybe a colorful salad container would be appreciated. Try 'Garden Babies' butterhead lettuce, 'Sweetie Baby Romaine', 'Sea of Red' lettuce, 'Thumbelina' carrot, and 'Salad Bush' cucumber for a one-pot salad that's ready to harvest. Some vegetables are beautiful and healthy: An all-eggplant container that would also be a conversation starter could contain the All-America Selection winners 'Hansel', 'Gretel' and 'Fairy Tale'.\nMix flowers in with vegetables, mix herbs with flowers, mix tropicals with foliage plants. The potential for container combinations is endless, as long as you mix and match plants based on size and location of your container, and the light and water needs of the plants.\nCare of the container garden\nWater is absolutely essential, and outdoor containers will require frequent watering as the summer progresses and the plants get bigger. Advise your clients to check containers daily to see if they are dry, and be sure to water thoroughly till water drains through the bottom of the pot. Do not let plants sit in water; water is needed, but good drainage is also essential!\nFor best results over the summer, incorporate into the soil mix a timed-release fertilizer for flowering plants - do this before planting. In addition, fertilize every two weeks with a balanced nutrient mix (for example, 10-10-10 or 20-20-20) or a fertilizer for flowering plants (such as 9-18-9 or 5-10-10). This may seem like a lot of work, and you may need to remind your customers that these plants are in a confined, limited resource pot and will grow quickly. In addition, with the regular and frequent watering that outdoor container gardens require, many nutrients will be leached out of the soil.\nGardening can be tricky for those new to this most popular hobby, but gardening in containers is an easy way to get them started. Once successful, they'll keep coming back for more - more containers, more plants, more fertilizer and more education.\nThinking outside the pot\nA simple but effective combination of cool blooms and bold foliage makes a welcoming statement.\nCreativity comes out in individual container designs and groupings of containers when the limits are pushed. Overflowing containers can be dramatic, but may require a bit more care, a little more fertilizer and extra water.\nToo many plants? Simply remove one or more as the season progresses.\nToo few plants? Fill in with a bolder color or dramatic foliage. Be sure the plants that are added require the same care.\nJust right? That's the container that fills in, grows up and flows over using every square inch of space available.\nCreativity also arises when containers are used as a true garden space. The basics of garden planning and design still apply:\nSite selection and view\n"}, {"score": 511.76822, "uuid": "becccb0a-c36a-5280-9861-0e147ad9c2ec", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1009wb-17-19698", "target_hostname": "www.freedomclubusa.org", "target_uri": "http://www.freedomclubusa.org/health_news", "page_rank": 1.2615646e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Freedom Resource Center - <em>Health</em> News", "snippet": "<em>is</em> the safe route...cooking <em>in</em> glass <em>or</em> the old cast iron skillet <em>is</em> far safer than heating <em>in</em> <em>plastic</em> <em>or</em> cooking <em>in</em> stainless steel * Avoid microwave ovens for many reasons but don&#x27;t heat food with <em>plastic</em> wrap attached because <em>of</em> the BPA and PVC implications, especially with the heat and radiation", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 508.73483, "uuid": "9051ea3a-5033-5677-ae82-32d4dec02834", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-15-21025", "target_hostname": "www.crazyfortea.com", "target_uri": "http://www.crazyfortea.com/index.html", "page_rank": 3.0001144e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Herbal Tea - Black Tea - Green Tea - Crazy For Tea - For Great <em>Health</em> !", "snippet": "Acai Pure Juice - Find out about the benefits <em>of</em> acai berry juice and how the acai berry can improve your <em>health</em>.

The original rec.crafts.metalworking charter. A tiny bit of history: there existed a group trial.rec.metalworking, but few sites pick up the \"trial\" feed. Also, the trial method of group creation sort of died of neglect, so this group (rec.crafts.metalworking) was created to take its place and become an official wide-spread group. Charter ------- Charter -- REC.CRAFTS.METALWORKING The USENET newsgroup, rec.crafts.metalworking, is a newsgroup which discusses various aspects of working with metal, such as (but not limited to): machining, as on a lathe, milling machine, grinder, etc.; numerical control of such machines; welding, whether by gas, arc, mig, tig, thermite, or other methods; Metal joining, whether welding, brazing, soldering, riveting, screwing, folding, etc. (this section was added during the discussion) casting various metals by various methods; hardening/tempering various metals; blacksmithing/forging; spinning and hammer work; sheet metal work; jewelry-making; purchasing and/or reconditioning metalworking tools and machinery; interesting projects; books on metal technologies and history; Example areas of interest: knife/sword making; automotive repair; steam engine (model/scale, though full-sized discussions are welcome!); art work, such as bronze castings and sculptures; gunsmithing; toolmaking, such as for woodworking, further metalworking, etc.; While the bulk of the discussion will probably be directed towards small-scale \"home\" shops, industrial/production discussions are also quite welcome. 2.

A mailing list for knifemakers was created in early 1995: Such a list is now available, and may be joined by sending mail to majordomo@swcp.com containing a line \"subscribe knife-list\". Following is the announce text for the list: The purpose of this mail list is to be a forum where knife makers and bladesmiths discus technical, artistic, political, and business ideas related to the field of custom and handmade cutlery. Knife fighting techniques and martial arts are not part of the discussion, except where it relates to an actual knife design. In short, this mailing list is for knife makers, sword makers, bladesmiths, and serious collectors of custom and handmade cutlery. An older mailing list for knifemakers, collectors, and people interested in edged-weaponry martial arts and techniques is the EDGE mailing list. Requests to be added to this list should be sent to: EDGE-owner@HICOM.LUT.AC.UK Submissions to the list itself should be sent to: EDGE@hicom.lut.ac.uk Topics on this list have ranged across topics like discussions of the types of steels used in knives, and why select one over another; the qualities and selection of different types of pocket tools [such as the Gerber Multi-Plier, the Leatherman, the SOG Toolclip, etc.]; current sales on knives from mail-order or discount-house sources; why Japanese swords are made the way they are/were, and how to take care of such a sword; selecting modern reproduction swords for martial-arts purposes; and many other edged-weapon and edged-tool subjects. However, lately (April 1995) it has been heard that the list is largely dead and unresponsive. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Silversmithing (commercial): http://www.gold.net/users/dy93/.

What are some good books and/or video tapes on metalworking? Note that this is not a complete list. If you are looking for books on anodizing, there is a separate FAQ section that deals with that topic and lists several books. - How to Run a Lathe This book is available from South Bend distributors, such as Blue Ridge, and/or Lindsay. It was originally printed in 1914 and last updated in 1966, I believe. - Advanced Machine Work by Robert H. Smith (1925). This book is not as \"advanced\" as the title might indicate, but assumes that you are not a total beginner. Available from Lindsay Publications (Cat. No 4236, $27.50, hardcover). - Machine Tool Operation, Vol. 1 & 2, by Henry Burghardt, Aaron Axelrod & James Anderson. These books were for many years the standard text in trade schools and technical colleges. Volume one covers the basics: safety, measuring, bench work, drill press, lathe and forge. Volume two covers: shaper, planer, milling machine, grinding, hydraulics, band saw, metallurgy, and cutting fluids. Your best source for these is a used book store or a technical school library. They overlap much of \"Advanced Machine Work\", but neither is a complete substitute for the other. - Materials Handbook by George S. Brady (McGraw-Hill Book Co.) \"An encyclopedia for purchasing managers, engineers, executives, and foremen\". Essentially, it gives an \"executive summary\" of virtually every material that is valuable in commerce. For instance, there is a two-page entry for \"Die Steels\". It is not aimed at the scientist or engineer; it is aimed at the person who needs to quickly understand the important characteristics and economics of industrial materials without involvement in details. It does cover a lot of non-metal materials as well. - Machine-Tool Work, by William P Turner and Halsey F Owen. 1932 and 1945 (hence no ISBN number). Some libraries may still have a copy, though you're probably out of luck for a purchase. Moderately good text, very good diagrams and pictures, especially of huge special-purpose machines like railroad wheel grinders. Suffers a bit from age, and seems intended for large industrial shops, but a good read if you find it. - Machine Shop Theory and Practice, by Albert M Wagener and Harlan R Arthur. 1941 (hence no ISBN number). Some libraries may still have a copy, though you're probably out of luck for a purchase. Fairly good text, more specific techniques than the Turner/Owen book. Suffers a bit from age, but still a nice instructional book. - Lathe Operations, by Richard R. Kibbe. 1985, ISBN 0-471-89023-5. Adapted from materials originally prepared by the Engineering Industry Training Board of Great Britain. Also in the same series: Milling Machine Operations, and Grinding Machine Operations. A step-by-step text with about 2 photos and lots of simple but usually-clear drawings. Shows how to do most any common lathe operation (and a few uncommon ones) in as few words as possible. Check page 90 for what seems to be a man with two right hands. - Machine Tool Practices, by Kibbe,Neely, Meyer and White. It's the first year machine shop text used by some community colleges. - The Making of Tools, by Alexander G Weygers Prentice Hall Press, 1973, ISBN 0-671-60924-6. A modern book about doing things the old way. How the artist/craftsperson can design, make, sharpen and temper tools. May be available from Centaur Forge. - Machinery's Handbook. A standard reference book for machinists, available from most distributors of machines or tools. http://www.industrialpress.com/handbook/index.html - Clockmaking & Modelmaking; tools and techniques by W.R. Smith Mr. Smith has published other books on clockmaking, but this one covers more than just clocks, and is thus of interest to more than just clock-makers. This is a collection of articles from the British Horological Journal, Timecraft, Model Engineer, and Horological Times. The articles have been updated and expanded for inclusion in this 112-page coil-bound book. For a complete review, see HSM Jan/Feb 1992, page 14. Available from Gateway Clocks (see names/addresses section), $35 post-paid within USA (overseas buyers add $5 for postage). - Elmer's Engines, by Elmer Verberg, available from Modeltec magazine. Has many very nice, and fairly easy to build stationary steam engines. - Model Locomotive and Marine Boilers [Argus Press, 1988, ISBN 0-85242-923-1] by Martin Evans (well known in the Model Engineering field, at least in Great Britain) - Model Boilers & Boilermaking by K.N.Harris, published 1971 Possibly available from Argus. - The Shop Wisdom of Frank McLean, available from Village Press. Lots of good ideas, and common sense approaches, and the few pages about inspecting used machines is worth its weight in gold for first time buyers. - THE MACHINIST'S BEDSIDE READER Guy Lautard 2570 Rosebery Avenue West Vancouver, B.C., Canada V7V 2Z9 (Some of Guy's books are also available from other suppliers, such as MSC) Contains: Working drawings and detailed instructions for making 15 useful and practical machinists tools and lathe accessories; dozens of hints, tips and tricks to help get things done faster, easier and better in your shop; a collection of 2 dozen machine shop anecdotes; 2 highly readable machinists short stories. Projects include: a sharpening jig for drill from 1/8 to #60, a swiveling base for a 2\" Wilton vise, a graduated handwheel for the lathe leadscrew.........and many more THE MACHINIST'S SECOND BEDSIDE READER Similar in format to the first book; projects include: a small pantograph engraving machine, a tool maker's block, poor man's jig borer and a kerosene-burning blowtorch....... also a short story titled \"The Bullseye Mixture\" which details the method for carbon pack color casehardening. THE MACHINIST'S THIRD BEDSIDE READER Some of the projects/info: color casehardening, a co-ax indicator, a collet chuck system, a deluxe overhaul of a keyless drill chuck, sharpening tools, sandblasting, setting up work on a faceplate, taper turning, knurling flat surfaces, and more. \"A Treatise on Oiling Machine Tools\" Very small (25 pages), very costly ($7.95), and not much useful information according to Tom Walter. One useful warning is to not use way oils in a milling machine's centralized oiling system, as some of them contain wax which will clog the system. Other books and plans by Lautard (not a complete list): \"Hey Tim, I gotta tell ya....' a mini Bedside Reader\" \"3.75 Inch Diameter Ungeared Rotary Table\" \"Universal Sleeve Clamp\". Lautard's targeted readership seems to be the home machinist. I'm sure that much of what he has to say may be \"old hat\" to a skilled machinist with many years experience. I confess that I am a rank amateur in machine shop practice (my only professional experience was as a part-time helper in a gunsmith shop where the machine I got to know best was the polishing wheel). The flyer I quote from is available from Lautard at the address I gave with my last posting. [reviews and typing courtesy of Michael Gordon, except for the description of the third bedside reader. JK] It has also been reported that Guy sells an index of some sort, either of all projects or all articles, in the back issues of Model Engineer. See also the description of Model Engineer magazine. - Machine Tool Reconditioning, by Connelly Covers reconditioning of machine tools, including figuring out what's off on lathes and such. Also a good section on scraping (i.e. removing small areas of metal by scraping, such as making a plate very flat). Mostly deals with reconditioning ways, and does not spend much time on mechanical problems such as worn nuts or gears. Currently available from Machine Tool Publications, Suite 208, 1600 University Ave. W, St. Paul Minnesota 55104, (612) 458-1540. The current (January 1998) price per an ad in HSM is listed as $92.95 plus $5 shipping. May also still be available via Dapra Corp., 66 Granby Street, Bloomfield, CT 06002 (860) 242-8539. Last time anybody mentioned their price it was $81, but call and check. - The Surface Treatment and Finishing of Aluminum and its Alloys, Edited by S. Wernick, R. Pinner, and P.G. Sheasby. Published 1987 by ASM International, Metals Park, Ohio. 2 volumes. Mentioned in sci.materials in response to a \"how do I anodize aluminum?\" question. - Electroplating for the Amateur, by L. Warburton. Model & Allied Publications. Available via Argus. - The Electroplater's Handbook, by C.W. Ammen TAB books.

Projects using the Sherline machine system. - Machinists' Ready Reference, 7th edition (c)1989 [Prakken Publications, Inc], Compiled by Clarence Weigartner, ISBN 0-911168-74-5, 7th edition: $12.50/$10.00(schools), new 8th edition: $14.50 Pocket sized (4.5\" x 6\"). Good student guide to math, drills, tapers, threads, milling/turning speeds, gears, weights & reading shop prints. Sort of a \"poor man's Machinery's Handbook\". - How To Work Sheet Metal, by Herbert Dyer Available from Power Model Supply. Highly recommended by Guy Lautard in his Machinist's Bedside Reader. - The New Science of Strong Materials, 1968 (1st ed.), 1976 (2nd ed.), 1984 (Penguin paperback). J.E. Gordon, Princeton University Press. (review courtesy of Bob Powell): This wonderful 280 page paperback lucidly covers the realm of materials science and engineering, in lay terms rather than textbook theory, but with enough depth and detail to satisfy an engineer in a different discipline. Explains, along the way, the physical and chemical nature of wood, and the nature and evolution of all common glue types, plastics, composites from straw-clay brick to fiberglass to kevlar, through iron and steel and alloy metals. Elasticity and the theory of strength and toughness, with basic beam theory developed from first principles. Cracks, defects and crack propagation (why glass bends then shatters), hardening and tempering, and to boot, the best explanation I've seen of all the classic iron and steel making processes. For the wood-inclined, a whole chapter on timber and cellulose from the molecular level up through the evolution of the structural design of wooden ships and (wood) airplanes, with insight into wood drying and wood rot. Dedicates a chapter alone to the evolution of wood glue and the operation and properties of each type. - The Starrett Book for Student Machinists (c)1941, 1975 & 1982 [160 pages] Catalog #1700 @ $8.50. Drawing, fits, bench work, how to measure, cutting speed/fluids, drilling, lathe operations, grinding, sawing, toolmaking, geometry, mechanics, & reference tables. Good information, well worth the price. It covers screw cutting, via the lathe, better than most. Be sure to get the FREE Starrett information, \"single copy mailed to individual craftsmen.\" Decimal Equivalent Card (pocket size 3\" x 5\"); The Starrett Story (36 pages 4-5/8\" x 6-7/8\"); The Tools and Rules for Precision Measuring, Bulletin #1211 (80 pages 5-1/4\" x 7-5/8\") - Watch Making, by George Daniels. - De Re Metallica (Georgius Agricola, 1556) translated by Herbert Hoover - Pirotechnia (Vannoccio Biringuccio, 1540) translated by Smith & Gnudi These two are Dover reprints, and were state-of-the art from renaissance through perhaps 1850 or so. The first is on mining, and the second on metalworking. An interesting historical look at how things were done in earlier times, and why they thought it worked. - Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture, Copyright 1979, I.D.Faux, M.J. Pratt. Ellis Horwood Publishers, a division of John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 0-85312-114-1 Very good overall text on surfaces and design. Was recommended as a way of learning strange jargon used in CNC machining of surfaces, such as loft, nurbs, and coons. - Computer Numerical Control: Essentials in Programming and Networking by Lin. Delmar Publishers, Inc. 3 Columbia Circle, P. O. Box 15015, Albany, NY 12212-5015. (800-347-7707) (recommended by Jerry Kimberlin) This is a textbook for a 2 semester course. It assumes you know nothing and takes you through the whole thing including G, N, APT...2D, 3D, CNC networking, the math, etc. I don't remember the exact price but it is over $50 and less than $70. - The New Edge of the Anvil, by Jack Andrews Not only is it a great intro to blacksmithing, but it also has the most wonderfully brief description of metallurgy and heat treating. It is available from Skipjack Press direct at: 637 Drexel Ave. Drexel Hill , PA 19026 or e-mail andrews@hslc.org -------------------------------------------------------------------- The following suggested books pertain to jewelry-making, per Sherry Lem. The Complete Metalsmith ISBN 0-87192-240-1, $14.98 Tim McCreight Davis Publications, Inc. Worcester, MA, 1991 Excellent, easy to follow techniques for beginning to intermediate levels, this is the revised edition which is much improved over the original. Contemporary Jewelry, Philip Morton Holt, Rinehart & Winston NY, 1970, 1976 Interesting design philosophy, techniques. Design and Creation of Jewelry, Robert vonNeumann Chilton Radnor, PA, 1961, 1972 Form Emphasis for Metalsmiths, Heikki Seppa Kent State University Press Kent, OH 1978 Perhaps THE book on anticlastic raising/forming, though difficult to teach yourself from the pictures and instructions. Jewelry Concepts and Technology ISBN 0-385-04185-3, $100.00 Oppi Untracht Doubleday & Company Garden City, NY, 1982, 1985 Most comprehensive guide on jewelry making techniques, also contains gemological data, info on setting up a workshop. Also, his \"Metal Techniques for Craftsmen\" $75.00 is a somewhat abridged version. Jewelry: Contemporary Design and Technique, Chuck Evans Davis Publications Worcester, MA, 1983 Especially good sections on mixed metals (mokume gane, etc.). Jewelry Making and Design, Augustus F. Rose and Antonio Cirino Dover Publications, Inc. NY, 1949, 1967 Decidedly English flavor, very inexpensively priced.

Jewelry Manufacture and Repair, Charles Jarvis Bonanza, NY, 1978 Metal Sculpture - New Forms New Techniques, John Lynch The Viking Press NY, NY Basic art metal techniques. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Another book, suggested by Marc Kerr: \"Silversmithing\" by Finegold $35.00. This is an excellent book if you are really after smithing and not jewelry making. It has very good descriptions of the smithing process and walks you through a few projects like a bowl, box with hinge and others. -------------------------------------------------------------------- How about video tapes? - New Life Video Productions Several tapes with Rudy Kouhoupt, frequent author in HSM and other magazines. Titles such as: \"Fundamentals of Machine Lathe Operation\" \"Fundamentals of Milling Machine Operations\" \"How to Cut Spur Gears\" \"How to Cut Screw Threads\" \"Building a Sterling Hot Air Engine\" Price varies from tape to tape. Production qualities seem poor (based on viewing the first title), such as poor and inconsistent audio, including a radio playing in the background. But you can safely ignore this and concentrate on what Rudy is trying to show you. Seems reasonably priced for the material covered. The material is quite good for the beginner (\"I just got a vertical mill; how do I use it?\"), or perhaps even the advanced beginner. These are probably tapes you will watch once or twice, so it would be nice if you could rent instead of purchase them! Most of them seem to focus on making a simple but useful project while presenting the material. - Bailey Craftsman Supply \"Greensand Casting Techniques\" from David Gingery's workshop. HSM seemed to like it. Others include a second volume of the above, Basic Metal Lathe Operation (2 vol), Basic Milling Machine Operation. - Darrell Markewitz, Wareham Forge \"A 3 hour instructional VIDEO - $25.00 each (includes postage)\" \"This video contains a wealth of information, including what to look for in used tools, building a home shop, and demonstrations of a number of basic forming techniques.\" PART 1 - TOOLS: forges; lighting a fire; coal anvils; hammers; vises; safety PART 2 - TECHNIQUES: 'S' hooks; tent peg; fire poker twists; toasting fork; home forge the WAREHAM FORGE Hamlet of Wareham - RR #2 Proton Stn Ont, CDN - N0C 1L0 (519) 923-9219, wareham.forge@headwaters.com - Artistic Iron Instructional video tapes on blacksmithing. http://www.artisticiron.com - Quality Street Productions The Fourth Annual NAMES Expo (1993) - Starrett Tools and Rules for Precision Measuring - Colonial Williamsburg P.O.

Sandy Grossmann sez: \"He takes you step by step through a couple of projects. When *he* does it, it sure looks simple! He gives some great shortcuts, and his examples are instructive.\" \"I especially liked his sections on riveting and on using a rolling mill. Very useful. The entire video is oriented toward jewelry, but he also does a sterling silver box. You can get the video mailorder from River Gems and Findings (phone 1-800-545-6566) or from TSI (I think). Last time I checked it was about $40.\" - Toika Bridges (http://members.aol.com/t2945/page1.html) Video tape and other information on anodizing titanium and niobium. Archive-name: metalworking-faq/part2 This is the FAQ for rec.crafts.metalworking. It is in several pieces to keep the overall size of each part below the limits imposed by some news systems. This is part 2 of 11. Generally, units below are United States dollars, degrees Fahrenheit, and all the other silly backwards units we Americans still use. Sorry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Who makes good lathes/mills/etc? Who makes good cars? This is almost purely a personal preference, though in general the imported machines (Grizzly, Jet, Enco) seem to rate lower than US-built machines (South Bend, Bridgeport). However, the imports are usually MUCH less expensive, offsetting some of the quality issues for home shops. There is some indication that Grizzly equipment is slightly better than other \"Taiwanese\" machines such as Enco, and that Jet is slightly better than Grizzly. Prices go up with quality. One of the main complaints about Taiwanese machinery is the lack of replacement parts and service. Grizzly claims that they keep a supply of parts on hand for all their machines. The same factories appear to turn out Grizzly, Jet, Delta, and the \"no-name\" machinery. A few years ago Fine Woodworking magazine published an article on this subject. Unimats are sometimes considered \"toys\" rather than real machines, though they may do just what you want if you don't push them hard. Some Unimat owners are quite pleased, in fact (hi Reg!). The Unimat PC may be a nice small CNC lathe; any experiences? Unimat, Sherline, and Taig are \"micro lathes\" in that the swing over the bed is less than 5 inches, and the bed is about a foot long. Sherline and Taig are made in the US, and Unimat is made in Austria (and hence uses metric threads, e.g. in the spindle thread, which may be a pain to US buyers). Sherline and Taig both use 3/4 inch x 16 threads in the spindle and can thus interchange accessories*. The Taig cannot cut threads, while the Sherline and Unimat can (with accessories). Sherline and Unimat sell a milling add-on. The Taigs come in unbundled kit form where you have to buy everything; they claim an overall accuracy of .0004 inch and have excellent parts and service, and also sell a watchmaking headstock. Taig is the cheapest at about $250 to get started, about $450 for Sherline. It appears the only Unimat now being sold is the CNC \"Unimat PC\", at about $750. Unimat seems to charge quite a bit more than normal for accessories. Just keep in mind that these are not as rigid or powerful as full-sized lathes. * It has been reported that although the Taig and Sherline use a 3/4-16 spindle thread, the threads on Taig chucks and faceplates are recessed far enough that a Sherline lathe will only grab about 1.5 threads, not enough to be usable. However, one reader bored out the back of a Taig faceplate to 1 inch diameter for about 1/4 inch depth, and reports it threads on his Sherline quite well now. So, be careful if purchasing a Taig accessory for use on a Sherline lathe! Harbor Freight sells a \"precision 4x10\" mini-lathe for around $400 with autofeed, change gears for most english threads at extra cost. It is actually a 7\" lathe which takes standard 2MT tailstock tooling and 3/8\" cutting tools, and has Electronic Variable Speed (EVS) instead of changeable belts. This is larger and sturdier than the Unimat/Sherline/Taig, and sounds similar to the 8\" Grizzly except for the EVS. What can you do if you have little money? Aside from looking at used equipment, you can actually build a lathe and other machine tools. Dave Gingery wrote an excellent series of books on building your own machine tools with just hand tools. While it's a lot of work, you can learn a lot. First you make an aluminum charcoal foundry, then a lathe, and finish up with a dividing head (five or six books later). Other authors have published detailed plans for making lathes. See the publisher's catalogs from Lindsay, Cole's, Power Model, Tee, Nexus, and Argus. A very thorough discussion of vertical mills and what to look for was in Home Shop Machinist, July/August and September/October 1993, by Thomas Howard. Here is a very brief summary: 1. Spindle-to-table distance, or \"daylight.\" Remember that by the time you clamp your work in a vise on a rotary table then slap a chuck with a drill into the spindle, you might run out of room. Try to anticipate your needs. 2. Knee mills: A mill where you can raise/lower the table with a crank, as opposed to only raising/lowering the head and/or quill. Knee mills are generally more useful and accurate. 3. Spindle brake: Locks the spindle during tool-changing. Very nice to have. 4. Power downfeed on spindle. A very nice option, relieves tedium when boring, and often yields better surface finish. 5. Spindle taper: determines what type of tooling you can \"plug in\" to the spindle. R-8 is most popular, and there's lots of inexpensive tooling. Morse and Brown&Sharpe exist and are less popular. 6. Bearings: Apparently it's not as important whether they are ball roller bearings, as the grade. And the better the grade, the longer the machine lasts, more than anything else. 7. Table sizes and travel: Like lathes, you can always use one an inch larger! Don't buy one larger than you have room for. From 6x20 (inch) to 8x30 seems right for most home shops. What will you be doing with it? 8. Power feed on X/Y axes. Very nice to have, just barely falls into the \"luxury\" status. 9. Table and knee locks: Used to maintain rigid setups when one of the axes won't be changed during an operation. Check for easy access and that they lock solidly. 10. Graduated dials with adjustable zero: an absolute necessity. 11. Adjustable gibs: a necessity. 12. Range and number of speeds. An average is 100-2500 rpm, and 12 to 16 speeds. Howard goes into great depth in his article to explain why you need both a wide range of rpm and many speed, and how those speeds should be spread out in a geometric progression. 13. Motors: be sure you get a motor you can run. Check frequency (60 or 50 Hz), voltage, and 1-phase vs 3-phase. For home-shop use, anywhere from 3/4 to 1-1/2 seems right. 14. One-shot oilers are nice but in many cases they don't work right and are hard to check. 15. Look. If at all possible, examine the machine you want, before you buy. 16. Buying used: you should be experienced enough to know what to test for! Or \"borrow\" somebody who is. 17. Will it fit? Be sure it can be moved to where you want it. Don't buy then find the stairwell is smaller than you thought. Get professional movers to do the moving; \"real\" mills are literally \"killers.\" 18. Tooling: can sometimes double the cost. ........................................ The following comments, regarding the Central Machinery (Harbor Freight Salvage) \"Precision 7\"x10\" Mini Lathe\", were originally sent to John Kopf in response to a query of his, asking the opinions of this versus the Grizzley 8x18 lathe. Date: Tue, 23 Nov 1993 09:40:15 CST From:\n(Gordon Pari) I own a 7 x 10 mini-lathe offered by Harbor Freight. First, the good points. Compact size useful for relatively large turnings...easy to move/store....tight headstock bearings....nice 3-jaw Yamakawa (japanese) chuck....good cross-feed and compound feed...good accuracy overall... Mt2 tailstock compatability...fun to use...3/4\" hole in spindle.... quiet without feed engaged....relatively easy to set-up tooling... cuts threads.....has chip tray...uses cheap 3/8 tooling. Now for the down side....motor on mine with a Dremel speed control substituted for the factory setup has good high-speed power but is lacking in low-speed torque....my set-up produces surges of rpm occasionally... newer version appear to have 2-speed setup that may help... HF parts supply is limited....I could not get jaws for the chuck (I need inside gripping because they were missing..used equipment!)...feed screw is poorly mounted/designed and uses up a lot of available power.....split nut on carriage is prone to disengage...the motor is 120V DC fed by a rectifier and that may be part of my problem.. manual carriage feed wheel/mechanism is not smooth and perhaps needs bushed. Overall, I love it because I bought it used needing some repairs for $95. Enco in Chicago now offers it for $1000. They are more reputable than HF IMHO. They also cannot provide my jaws or a specifically designed 4-jaw. If I paid $800 I would want the split-nut and RPM/POWER problems completely eliminated. After my initial $95, I have spent about $65 for a live center and tools from Enco. I use it weekly and am learning a lot. A friend who is a lathe operator has used it and is impressed. I hope this helps. If you buy one and find solutions/parts, keep me posted.

Though it's not clear in the catalog, it already DOES come with the lathe (unless you order the ~$550 version that says \"same as above, but without threading capability.\") ... I've enjoyed the lathe, have been pretty happy with it, but have no other experience to be able to compare it to any other like the Grizzly you're also looking at. Date: Tue, 30 Nov 93 14:18:01 EST From: fisher@gaas.enet.dec.com I purchased one of these mini-lathes this summer. Since then I have read a few books and learned much about lathes. If I had to do it over again I would purchase the Grizzly \"8\"x18\" Lathe you mentioned. I kinda like the mini-lathe for 1) the size and 2) the variable speed motor. What I don't like is 1) Support (I had a bent shaft on my cross slide and called them back within 48 hours after receiving the lathe and I still haven't received the replacement part - I think they ordered it from Korea.), 2) It is sufficiently non-standard that Nobody makes a 4 jaw chuck for it or any other bolt on accessories such as a steady rest or a follow rest. But it seems to work and I have been having fun with it and learning. The size is great - I just finished cutting about 50 brass port holes for a model tub boat. 5. Where do I buy a machine? Check out the Yellow Pages, the ads in the magazines, and catalogs from the \"names and addresses\" section elsewhere in this FAQ. For example: Blue Ridge Machinery and Tools, Inc Alley Supply Company Enco Grizzly MSC 6. What are good magazines to subscribe to? - The Home Shop Machinist (HSM), \"dedicated to precision metalworking\" Published 6/year by Village Press (see addresses section), $27.50/year. Note that many back issues are not available, though most of the projects are available in the \"Projects\" book series. Mostly techniques, no steam, some gasoline engine projects, many tooling projects. Probably the best of the US magazines. Some projects will span several issues. - Machinist's Workshop, formerly Projects In Metal (PIM). Published 6 times per year by Village Press, $23. Mostly projects, few advertisements. Each project is complete in one issue. A \"weak sister\" to HSM, apparently started in part to handle overflow projects from HSM. Earlier back-issues have been combined into a new book series called \"Metalworking\". - Live Steam Magazine. Published 6 times per year by Village Press, $35. Mostly trains, some techniques, some stationary engines, lots of history and club information. Usually each issue has one stationary engine and two locomotive construction projects in various stages. - Model Engineer's Workshop Published bimonthly by Argus (or is it now Nexus?). Described as the British version of HSM, and similar to the tool-oriented writing in Model Engineer. U.S. subscription rate is $38. More \"packed\" than HSM, and features the uniquely English way of doing machining (e.g., spending hours to make a cutter to make the cutter for gear cutting, when many of us in the US would just order the gear cutter and be done with it).

Where might one take classes or get instruction? This depends on several factors, mostly where you live. Good places to check out include community colleges (universities sometimes will have classes in metalworking, but perhaps only for already-enrolled students or faculty/staff). Sometimes a high school will offer night or weekend classes to the public, funding permitting. Also look for vocational/technical schools, and possibly even art schools since some metal sculpturing requires a firm background in welding. In a few cases there may be specialized schools in your area, so check your yellow pages or ask around. Some examples: John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown NC (800) 562-2440, Craft Center in Ripley WV. Some schools also offer room and board and/or campground hookups. 8. Where can I get raw material for my projects? The Yellow Pages are often a good place to start. Also, the advertisements in magazines like Home Shop Machinist. Another way is to go find your nearest junk yard and/or metal recycling business and scrounge around. Make friends with a machinist at the nearest mining operation and ask for their throwaway \"scraps\". Order from a supply company (see ads in the magazines, and/or the \"names and addresses\" section elsewhere in this FAQ). Sometimes you can discover a creative re-use. For example, buy a few old aluminum automotive pistons, perhaps from your junk yard or a garage that rebuilds engines. Cut off the top and clean it up on your lathe. Now you have a nice round blank to start some project with. Similar discoveries should be posted to the newsgroup! Some of the magazines have ads for small \"garage\" shops that produce specialized castings. 9. Where can I get tools, drill bits, etc.? Many of the places that sell equipment also sell tools but there are also outlets that only sell accessories such as lathe bits, drills, taps, and so on. Scan the \"names and addresses\" section elsewhere in this FAQ. 10. What are some of the related professional/hobby associations?

Heat treating is a *huge* subject, and depends on the metal, and intended use. Most of the time, this question is asked regarding steel, so we'll give a brief description of that, based on an article in Home Shop Machinist (Sept/Oct 1991, \"Heat Treating Basics\" by Steve Acker). [Also thanks to Steve Gaudio (?) for his post of 18-Sep-1992, and clarification by Tim Eisele] Iron will, at common temperatures, organize itself into an atomic structure that is called \"body centered cubic.\" This consists of overlapping cubes with an atom at each corner, and one more in the center of the cube. But above roughly 1400 degrees F there is a change in structure to \"face centered cubic\" and the central atoms migrate to the faces of the cubes. This latter form is not magnetic. Steel is basically iron with some carbon mixed in, though modern alloys have various other metals and substances as well. When steel is heated to the critical temperature (about 1400 degrees F), the iron will change to face centered, and the carbon atoms will migrate into the central position formerly occupied by an iron atom. This form of red-hot steel is called austentite. Since it is not magnetic, a magnet may be used to determine when the critical temperature has been reached (though the magnetism may be lost before the transition, so this is only approximate). Complete migration of the carbon atoms may take a minute or two. If you let this cool slowly, the iron atoms migrate back into the cube and force the carbon back out, resulting in soft steel called pearlite. If the sample was formerly hard, this softening process is called annealing. If you cool (quench) the sample suddenly by immersing it in oil or water, the carbon atoms are trapped, and the result is a very hard, brittle steel. Too brittle for most uses. The structure is now a body centered tetragonal form called martensite. So, the next step is to heat it back up, to between 200 and 800 degrees F or so, depending on the desired end hardness. This allows some of the hardness to relieved and is called tempering. The amount of tempering that is desirable depends on the final use. Cutting tools are very hard, knife blades less so because they must flex under use rather than break. Tempering is a trade-off between hardness and flexibility. Accurately measuring the tempering temperature is important. A nice, expensive thermostatically-controlled oven is great. Or, some special compounds can be applied that melt or change color at the right temp, such as Tempilstik and Tempilaq. If the steel is clean to start with, then you may notice that it goes through certain color changes as it heats up, with understandably vague descriptions such as \"light straw\" indicating about 440 degrees F, and purple=520. These colors are not incandescence colors, but are viewed in normal room light. The colors are due to types of surface oxidation that are temperature dependent. When quenching, it is often very important to avoid stirring a part because this will cool one side much more quickly than the other, and might cause warping. For knife blades, as an example, move it strictly up and down during the quench. Case hardening is a bit trickier, and involves heating the object in some sort of agent that promotes hardening at the surface. Liquid cyanide works well but should be out of the question for the home machinist. Luckily there are substitutes available from suppliers, one being called Kasenit, for example. Note that hardness is often measured using a \"Rockwell C\" scale, with 63 being very hard and 35 being fairly soft. A type of steel called \"drill rod\" is especially useful for home/hobby use. As its name implies, it is the type of steel used for drills, and is available is round or square form (square drills?). Drill rod is also very useful around the shop because it is usually made to very accurate dimensions. Some types of drill rod are formulated for hardening via heating then quenching in oil, while others are quenched in water. The difference is that water will cool more quickly because it's a good conductor (though it may also form a steam \"jacket\" that moderates this effect), while oil will cool more slowly. Since rapid cooling may warp a part, this could make a difference in the final product. There is also an \"air hardening\" steel, though it seems to be quite a bit more expensive than other steels. It has been reported, by way of example, that you can make springs out of hacksaw blades by annealing, bending, hardening, then tempering by heating to a \"metallic blue\" and quenching in oil. I suspect lots of experimenting may be in order before you get things just right. Remember the steel must be clean (no paint etc.) to see the colors. Quenching in oil may be a fire hazard. Take proper precautions, such as removing flammable materials from the area, wear proper clothing, and have an extinguisher handy. Even quenching in water presents the risk of scalding from steam or splattered water. As one newsgroup reader pointed out, not only are there a gerbillion alloys, but zillions of treatments to choose from, and this is just for steels. Other metals, like brass, can be hardened by \"working\" the metal, by bending, hammering, peening, etc. Brass is usually annealed with a quench, which is the opposite of steel. It's best to carefully research your particular project first, especially if it's something that is valuable. A recent book, \"Simplified Tool Steel Heat Treatment and Selection Guide\" by Bill Bryson, may be of some help. $31.95 from Bill Bryson, 336 Governors Road, Milton, NH 03887. I purchased this, and was surprised to spend $32 on 100 pages of loose-leaf pages. The information is geared more towards the small commercial shop than the home shop, and thus deals with issues such as atmospheric control (using stainless-steel foil) and using accurate temperatures. In the home shop, we usually read about methods like \"hit it with a torch then drop it in a bucket of oil.\" Bryson goes beyond this, discussing accurate methods that might be out of reach for some of us, but just barely. He also has a chapter on cryogenic treatment, that can also be used in the home shop via dry ice. http://www.worldpath.net/~hisaim for more info and ordering info. Note the title has been changed to \"Heat Treatment, Selection, and Application of Tool Steels.\" Power Model Supply recently (December 1992) listed two small heat treating ovens in an HSM ad. 2000 degrees F, 4x4x4 inch $330, 6x6x6 $435. Write them for more info or see the ad. 10/27/97 somebody posted a URL for the \"heat treating industry\": http://www.heattreatingonline.com Archive-name: metalworking-faq/part3 This is the FAQ for rec.crafts.metalworking. It is in several pieces to keep the overall size of each part below the limits imposed by some news systems. This is part 3 of 11. Generally, units below are United States dollars, degrees Fahrenheit, and all the other silly backwards units we Americans still use. Sorry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. How do I wire up this strange motor? (with thanks to Bill Brown) The following describes how to deal with an AC/DC \"universal\" motor that has 4 unmarked wires coming out. Be sure you don't have some other motor, such as a 3-phase unit. Other motors are covered in an FAQ for the newsgroup rec.woodworking. The FAQ postings (six of them) for rec.woodworking are normally posted around the first of each month, and possibly also posted to the newsgroup news.answers. I can't say how long *your* news system will choose to keep these around! Look for \"Frequently Asked Questions about Electric Motors.\" Also, the \"Electrical Wiring FAQ\" may be of interest. The universal motor is called that because it can run on AC or DC. Older units might have been designed this way because very early power distribution had not settled on AC or DC, or with 50 or 60 cycles. Thus, such a motor could be used universally, in all locations provided the voltage was within reason. This still may be a concern with some on-site jobs feeding power tools from DC sources such as portable welding rigs. Another nice thing about these motors is that they are easily reversible. They are also easily speed-controlled, such as in hand drills, whereas induction motors prefer to run at or near synchronous speed. The first task is to determine which two wires go to the armature, and which go to the field winding. If you can't tell by examining where the wires go (or the nameplate), get an ohmmeter and connect it to the wires until you find two that show some continuity. Rotate the shaft slowly by hand and note if the resistance changes as you turn it. If it does, you probably have the armature, and the fluctuations are due to the brushes making and breaking contact with the commutator. The other winding (field coil) should show a steady resistance. Presuming you want the ability to reverse the motor, find a switch that can handle the rated current, in the double-pole-double-throw configuration with a center-off position. The suggested hook-up is (as usual, a bad ASCII graphic): +-------------------+ 1 | | 2 ----------FIELD-------o<--O o A 0 white \\ / R \\ / M V X A O / \\ T L black / \\ U T ----------------------o<--O o E S | | +-------------------+ NOTE: no connection at \"X\"; Include a green-wire frame ground if at all possible Avoid reversing the motor while it is moving in the \"other\" direction as this could severely stress the switch and motor (particularly the brushes). Move the switch to the center (off) position, and continue on to the other direction after the motor has stopped. Please, always be careful when dealing with electricity. If you don't feel comfortable and safe doing such a hook-up, find someone who can do it for you, or at least who can check what you're doing. 13. How do I deal with mail-order suppliers? The following suggestions were offered by Stu Friedberg -- Get the catalogs and know what you want. There are often many sizes, models, and sources of an \"X\", so you need to know which particular X when you write and especially when you call to place an order. Even the smallest industrial supply houses deal in tens of thousands of items, which means even very knowledgeable order-takers can't always give you the information you need over the phone. Reserve queries about details for stuff that you couldn't figure out for yourself. Many of the order takers are very helpful and knowledgeable. At *SOME* sources the order takers can actually go look in the stock bins, take a micrometer to measure a shaft diameter, etc. I have had people at three different companies do something like this for me. However, some companies have computerized centralized order taking at a location completely separate from their stocking locations, so don't *assume* people can tell you anything that's not written in the catalog. I've had one company tell me to just order a set of change gears and return them if I couldn't use them. This wasn't crazy, the order taker simply had no relevant information available. Get the catalogs and shop around. Very often there are *big* differences in price between identical items, and even more often one source will have a unique or slightly different item at an excellent price compared to the \"standard\" item. There are lots of reasons for this. I have seen 2 to 1 price ratios on things like shim stock (from the same manufacturer) and \"can't twist\" clamps (from different manufactures but of equal quality). Occasionally, you will find 10 to 1 price ratios on things like boxes of hose clamps. Great deals if you look around. If you can, examine a tool at a local store (where the prices may be higher) to see what the quality is like, before placing the order by mail or telephone. You can also learn a great deal by perusing the catalogs, both about tools in general, and about specific details of specific tools. There's seldom enough room in a catalog to print all the manufacturer's data, but different sources will select different stuff to print. I have many times used one company's catalog to select the precise thing I wanted, then bought it from another company because the price was better. Most suppliers ship quickly if they have a credit card authorization. If they don't ship within two working days on a routine basis, shop somewhere else in the future. One full working day is quite common. I have had only one bad incident in the 4 or 5 years I've been buying industrial stuff by telephone, and came through with no losses. A supply company (which entered bankruptcy proceedings just a little while ago, by the way) charged my credit card for the full amount of my order, didn't ship for a month, and was completely clueless as to when they would ship my order. That is intolerable, and protection against abuse like that is one good reason to use a credit card rather than sending a check. You don't need to sue to get your money back if the merchant doesn't come through. (If it's not obvious, I got my money back and started to throw out that company's catalogs as they arrived.) Some industrial suppliers don't do back orders because it slows things down. The stock pickers send what's in stock and mark out of stock items on the invoice. This may be a little different from retail mail order sources you've dealt with in the past. Contact them about what's in stock and when it's expected to be available. Be prepared to return an item. Having to return an item because it was misshipped, defective, or of unsatisfactory quality is *NOT* an indictment of the supplier. If you do enough shopping for industrial supplies, you will find that you have to do a partial return maybe 1 time in 5. Don't get mad; don't get upset. It's routine. Industrial supply and consumer retail have different expectations about quality control. When you return an item, follow instructions. Many, but not all, suppliers require you to contact them for a \"return authorization\" number, which you must write on the outside of the package. You should include a copy of the invoice in the package. This is *NOT* an opportunity for the supplier to screw you over. This is a routine matter, and most of them just ask you to note on the invoice what was wrong and if you want credit, a refund, an exchange for something else, or whatever. 14. How to sharpen knives, chisels, and other tools? This is actually a tricky subject, and beyond the scope of this FAQ. However, an excellent book on sharpening knives and similar tools is: The Razor Edge Book of Sharpening, by John Juranitch. 1985 by Warner Books, ISBN 0-446-38002-4, $12.50 This book can sometimes be found in the larger knife stores, such as frequently found in USA malls (e.g. Cutlery World). It is a bit biased in that John also sells sharpening equipment, but the techniques are fundamental and can be used with competitor's equipment such as Lansky's. Another source for the book is Knife World Books, (800) 828-7751 Ext 71. Sharpening drill bits has never seemed easy. If you have lots of money, Darex makes drill and mill sharpeners, and Glendo's Accu- Finish line addresses simpler cutting bits (and they even re-sell some Darex tools in conjunction with their grinders). Black and Decker reportedly make a decent drill sharpener (1/8\" to 1/2\") for around $250. On 3/18/96, Curt Anderson (anderson@darex.com) posted a nice summary of some sharpening methods for drills: ------------------------- I'll list a few options and the pros and cons. 1. Sharpening off-hand. PRO: No expensive equipment other than a grinder is needed. There is certain satisfaction in knowing how to hand sharpen. CON: Its unlikely that the drill is ground concentricly or that the angles of the point are equal in length and degree. Thus the drill is really just cutting on one side. Therefore, the holes may not be the size or shape you expected. 2. There are various drill sharpeners sold in hardware stores. E.g.: the Accu-sharp, the Multi-sharp and the Martek. PRO: They are relatively cheap $69 and under. Some even sharpen other tools like chisels and knives. CON: In my opinion, they really do a lousy job on drills. For one thing, the operator is expected grind equal amounts off both cutting edges (this by eyeballing). Other than the more consistent angle, the drill might as well be sharpened by hand. 3. Another option is a machine-shop-quality sharpener like the Darex. (I should say that I work for Darex, so I'm somewhat biased). For those interested there is an extensive list of Darex pros, see http://www.darex.com). PRO: Accuracy and simplicity. The Darex (and some of our competitors) produce accurate drills and on-size holes. Drill points can be changed to meet the needs of varying materials. CON: The price. Our least expensive sharpener is the M3 at $298. Although, we sell a lot of M3s and even our more expensive models through \"HomeShop Machinist\", etc., we realize that the price may not be worth the convenience of having sharp, accurate drills for the casual hobbyists. 4. Another option is to send your drills to a sharpening service. (Jim Harvey of this newsgroup will sharpen your drills with a Darex. He is on the web. We have a link to Jim's sharpening service at http://www.darex.com/links.htm) PRO: You get drills that are as good as new at the angle and relief you want for a cost much less than new. CON: You may have to wait a day or two to get your drills back. 5. Run down to the hardware store each time you need a drill. Or keep a supply on hand. PRO: No big expenditures. CON: It's a hassle. ---------------------------- (end of note by curt) Some of the magazines will print articles from time to time on sharpening, and/or building sharpening equipment. For example, there is an article in the March/April 1996 issue of Home Shop Machinist by Frank McLean on setting up and using the less-expensive drill grinding attachments. 15. The following text on safety was donated by Gary Preckshot: The forces involved in metalworking machinery are far higher than most people expect. You can either be struck by shrapnel or pulled into a machine by being caught by a moving part. There are several rules that reduce these hazards: a) Don't wear loose clothes, ties, unsecured braids, or jewelry. b) Turn off machines and *WAIT* for rundown before approaching the working area. You'll spend a lot more time in an ER than you'll ever save by jumping in right away. c) Don't snap chips using a shop towel. Use a brush or air. d) Don't mess with long chips curling off a turning. If you get build up, stop the machine and remove the chips wearing leather gloves and using pliers. e) Keep power transmission belts of any kind isolated and guarded. Flat leather belts are especially hazardous because they tend to be unguarded on crowned cone pulleys. If in doubt, add more clamps. If in doubt, chuck more deeply or use a collet. A turning that comes adrift can damage both the lathe and you. A workpiece that shifts can damage both the mill and you. Stuff gets hot when cut. Let it cool before picking it up. Metal cutting generally leaves a sharp burr. Break the edges with a file or a de-burring tool before you release the work for general handling. Don't let kids, wives, husbands, girlfriends, or boyfriends close to metalworking operations without training or close supervision. Chips are extremely sharp. Long, curled chips from lathe turnings are especially dangerous because kids, wives, husbands, girlfriends, or boyfriends see only how pretty they are. You can get a very deep cut by handling such chips with your hands. Have a system for removing and storing chips. Use it regularly. Use eye protection - ALWAYS. Beware of fascination. Metal cutting tools flash and glint as they spin. An unwary person may reach toward the pretty, shiny tool. This is no joke. It happens. Then you take a trip to the local ER. Don't watch welding without adequate dark glass filters. You can get a tan in 2 minutes and a burn in five on any exposed skin close to arc welding. It doesn't hurt for about 3 hours, but then it hurts for days. Cover up. Don't play with air. Not only can it inject chips (by blowing them) into your body, but it can inject oily air as well. Sometimes right through the skin. Air is no joke. In general, no horseplay in the shop. Banish anybody who can't understand this simple rule. This is one place where absolute dictatorship is better than democracy. Take your time. You'll save on rework time, machine repair, and medical costs. 16. How do I drill round holes? In May 1993 the following question was posted. This brought a lot of useful suggestions for a problem often seen ... Subject: I can't drill round holes I am trying to drill 1/4\" holes in 3/32\" mild steel with a H/S twist bit in a 12\" Delta bench press. The holes are not round. They tend towards the triangular. The piece I am drilling has a 1 1/4\" square cross section. The distortion is worst in the exit hole through the bottom of the member. What is going on? Is there anything I can do to correct the problem? Morgan Hall gave the following shot as to how a simple twist drill manages to create a non-circular hole: Hint -- look at the rotor and housing of a Mazda rotary engine You can model the working end of a drill bit as a single straight line of finite length. If you fix one end and try to rotate it, the opposite end of the line sweeps out an arc. (the drill flexes) After about 1/3 revolution, the stuck end breaks free and sweeps out another arc while the formerly free end sticks. With alternate ends sticking, then breaking free, the arcs will form a kind of polygon with arcs of radius equal to the drill's diameter. After the first cuts, the \"corners\" of the polygon tend to stop the sweeping cut for each drill flute. The most common I've seen is the triangular hole, but other polygons are definitely possible. I suspect that this occurrence is related to some sort of resonance in the drilling setup. The suggestions that followed may be useful to anyone trying to drill holes. Some of them may qualify as 'obvious' but they're still worth bearing in mind... * Ensure the drill is sharp. * Make sure the work is firmly clamped * Don't try and run the bit too fast for the drill size and work material. * Don't force the feed rate; as with *any* cutting process, let the cutter do the cutting. * Keep as much of the drill in the chuck as possible. The more flexibility there is in the drill, the more likely you are to have problems. * When drilling thin material, it is often useful to provide some form of backing clamped to the work. This has the added advantage of keeping the burrs to a minimum. * The drill tip may need to be ground to a different angle, depending on the material being worked. * An undersize pilot hole is often a good idea. If you are drilling using a mark made with a centre punch and the tip of the drill is larger than the mark, you are unlikely to get accurate placement. * Don't forget to use a cutting lubricant * The quality of the hole is only going to be as good as the machine you are using will allow. If the drill spindle is sloppy, there may be nothing you can do about it. As a final comment, if you really want a round, accurately sized hole, you are unlikely to get it with a twist drill. Drill undersize and use a reamer if it's important. Another alternative to very finely finished holes is to force a hard polished sphere through a slightly undersized hole. See the vendor list, under \"Spheric\". 17. What's TIG and MIG? TIG - Tungsten Inert Gas; also called GTAW -- Gas Tungsten Arc Weld, but nobody calls it that except the American Welding Society (AWS) A small torch with a tungsten electrode is used to make the arc inside an envelope of an inert gas, usually argon or some argon mixture. A filler rod is manually introduced to complete the weld. The resulting weld is very pretty and usually requires no further finish. It is used mostly for welding sheets of mild steel, stainless steel or aluminum. The better machines have a foot control and a high frequency arc starter. Any sizable stick welder can be retro-fitted to do TIG welding, but without the foot control. MIG - Metal Inert Gas MIG and wire feed are the same thing. In this process, a consumable wire electrode is fed from a spool to the torch where the weld occurs inside an envelop of pure carbon dioxide, pure argon or a mixture of both. The weld continues as long as the operator has the trigger depressed and there is something to weld. This process is very fast, easy to learn and results in fairly good looking (better with argon) and strong welds. Most production welding of mild steel is now done with MIG welding. There is no slag to chip, but there is a slight thin coating of a glassy material that probably should be wire brushed off before painting. MIG welding can be used for thin or thick materials and is commonly used on mild steel, stainless and aluminum. Some common features of MIG machines are spot welding and stitch welding of sheet metal. There is a special wire called flux core that can be used in a MIG welder without the shielding gas. This process leaves a slag coating that must be chipped off. For most people on this group there isn't much use for flux core, as it was developed to reduce cost for large- scale welding where the cost of Argon starts piling up. There are fairly cheap 120 volt MIG welders that will only weld thin sheet metal. A more practical 240 volt machine that will weld up to about .25 inch is about $1500-$2000 new, $800-$1200 used. The machine I have will do MIG welding and stick welding, but most are MIG only. A machine that will weld .25 inch in a single pass will still weld thicker materials with multiple passes. 18. MIG welding technique. (The following was submitted by James Swonger on May 4, 1993) The quality of a MIG weld is controlled by gas flow, the qualities of that gas, the \"heat\" and feed rate settings. While getting a quality weld is less dependent on \"touch\" than gas or arc welding, it does depend on the right combination of the settable machine parameters. There are three modes of material transfer in a wire feed machine. One is \"blob mode\", where the wire sticks, then melts locally, then breaks. This occurs at the lower end of the heat/wire feed range. I say heat/feed rate as a ratio, because this pretty much determines which deposition mode you will see. Blob mode welds are the lowest penetration and lowest transferre heat, because there's almost no real arc action, just mostly resistive heating of the wire and contact point. The second mode as you move up the range is a soft arc with the metal being pushed through it. You'll recognize this mode when it happens; there's no more \"wire push\", the sound changes from a random snapping to a more uniform sizzle and everything just gets smooth. This is what I consider the ideal mode. The arc is stable but most of its energy is transferred into melting the fed wire and a localized area of the workpiece. In this mode I see about 1/4\" of heat affected zone around the weld (automotive sheet metal thickness), and by proper setting I can get perfect penetration which I define to be some backside protrusion but no sag or burn-through. The handpiece (\"gun\") in this mode may have a buzzing feel to it but none of the bucking you get in blob mode. The third mode is when heat is much higher than the wire feed rate needs. This mode is akin to traditional arc welding, except with a fed wire. The arc energy now is biased more into the workpiece, with attendant heating and penetration. The wire still adds filler but there is more tendency to undercut, eat back and blow through especially on thin pieces. In this high heat/feed mode the buzzing/sizzling sound is replaced by a more purely electrical arc sound (whispering/crackling). This mode is desirable when welding pieces much thicker than the wire, especially when you haven't taken the bother of grinding proper chamfers and need to get penetration. Gas flow provides an important cooling effect. This is one reason why flux cored wire is harder to use on sheet metal; there's no place for the weld heat to go except the workpiece. Argon, A75 and CO2 have different welding characteristics. Argon will make the weld \"sit up\" higher, CO2 gives the most penetration and A75 is in the middle somewhere. Only Argon is suitable for aluminum; A75 is sort of marginal for stainless (leaves some carbon) but pretty ideal for general mild steel use. An adjustable regulator provides more latitude in balancing arc heat/feed and cooling. A high flow of gas can reduce warpage while allowing faster material transfer. I have a cheap preset flow regulator which is a compromise setting, compromise price type deal. To minimize panel warpage you must apply some technique as well. The MIG machine does not eliminate the need for skill; it just lets you apply your attention to more important things and lets you slide on some of the basics. Warping results from too much differential heating and expansion in the workpiece. By understanding the material and equipment you can keep this from being a problem. Duty cycle is one simple way of further reducing overall heat input. By welding in short, spaced beads you can join panels without overheating any large areas. First the piece should be \"tacked\" every few inches, with bead lengths of 1/2\" or so. Make several passes after that, filling in the gaps bit by bit and not working any one region for long. The workpiece's thermal spreading will cool the small HAZ (*) pretty quickly if the total heat deposited remains small. A spot cools much more rapidly than a line. The edge of a thin metal piece presents a special case, a \"boundary condition\" which behaves differently than the bulk. With half the heat dissipation ability of the bulk, the edge will tend to burn back, distort and so on. This can be addressed by reducing heat (although this may force you into running blob mode), by different choice of metal overlap configuration and by carefully running the arc. A true butt joint in thin material is difficult to make. A -perfect- butting is hard to do on formed sheet metal, and any gaps will tend to enlarge in the welding process. For this reason a lapped weld is often preferred. A panel can be flanged to let the two pieces overlap but keep the final surface flush. The flange provides a backup as well in case of erosion of the edge on the top piece. =========\\\\W++++++++++++ \\\\==== A second sort of joint is a butted-V which protects the edges as the weld hits the sidewalls without necessarily reaching the bottom of the groove. --------\\WW+++++++++ \\+ Places like Eastwood sell specialty tools for making both types of flanges on sheet metal. Of course, you need to be careful not to cause deformation from the flanging process itself. I have made my own flanging tool for the first form out of an extra pair of Channel-Loks with extra jaw material brazed in and ground to shape. The Eastwood tool is Vise-Grip based and looks like it's a bit better as far as force required to make the flange due to the compound action. I think a pair of beat up sheet metal shears might be a better basis for making a new one. (*) HAZ = Heat Affected Zone; the area where you see thermally-induced material changes in the workpiece. This is basically the extent of any visible surface discoloration when using the MIG, although if you run the gas after stopping the arc you may not even be able to see anything because oxygen is excluded. If you remove the gas and arc together you will get the normal thin oxidation layer like you see when grinding or heating to temper. The outside of the blue oxide region is the periphery of the HAZ, although the material effects there are probably negligible. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The following was submitted by mrehmus@ix.netcom.com Use of MIG for body work. A bad idea fostered on us amateurs by our ignorance. If you look at the available wire for MIG, you don't find anything much softer than S60 or higher wire. In general, the higher the yield strength of metal, the harder it is to work. (Try forming tool-steel as a test). The weld bead left by a MIG is very hard relative to the body sheet metal and is almost impossible to work. It also cracks very easily even if one trys to anneal the metal in the weld. In restoring a 1967 Mercury Cougar I finally had to teach myself hammer welding using a welding torch. The results were much better!! 1. The seam is the same thickness as the parent sheet metal. 2. The seam is as soft or softer than the parent sheet metal. 3. The seam and the surrounding sheet metal are easily worked to remove any defects caused by the welding process. Should anyone want to equal the hammer welding process but with an electric source of heat, TIG is the only way to go. The filler metal selection is much, much wider and the TIG can be run way down to 10 amps or so which would probably let you weld aluminum foil if you wished. Oh yea, in the professional welder's world, the common opinion is that a TIG weld is superior to MIG. So why do the professional body shops like the MIG? It is necessary for the welding of high-strength steel that is commonly used in the structural parts of the modern automobile. Not, I repeat, NOT for the external sheet metal. The external sheet metal (the part we can see) is still mild steel because of the expense and difficulty of making sheet metal forming dies that would last and give good results with high-strength steel. Remember that body shops replace whole panels, they rarely \"patch\" a panel. The high-quality restoration shops use TIG or (usually) a torch and hammer welding. GOOD video tapes to know about: \"Learning MIG Welding\" by SIP (one source is J.C. Whitney, their # 12VL7580P, $26.99; their phone number is (312) 431-6102) \"Hammerwelding Techniques\" by Car Guy Videotapes \"Patch Panel Installation\" by Car Guy Videotapes I have watched these tapes many times, always learning more at every session. The tape on MIG welding uses a good visual filter technique to show every type of weld puddle. After viewing the tape, my MIG welding has been much better. Archive-name: metalworking-faq/part4 This is the FAQ for rec.crafts.metalworking. It is in several pieces to keep the overall size of each part below the limits imposed by some news systems.

Sorry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. Which MIG welder should I buy? We frequently see \"What should I buy\" questions; one example is \"What MIG welder should I buy?\" There is no definite answer, and the prospective buyer should read the other entries in this FAQ regarding welding. What follows is an example of such a question and the answers received (June, 1993). We claim no responsibility for correctness or liability for your money! Keith King asked: I'm looking at the purchase of a MIG welder for auto body repair and other light welding jobs around the homestead and I don't have much background on this type of equipment. The models I'm looking at are the Lincoln SP-100 and the Miller 130. Both models are 110v portables. The Miller has a higher rating but I'm not sure if that's critical for my applications. The Lincoln has the advantage of having infinitely variable power output vs. stepped output for the Miller and the salesman said the gun on the Lincoln was a \"Tweako?\" whatever that means. Both units are similarly priced/warranted etc. Century has a bunch of lower priced, shorter warranty, cheaper looking, MIG welders. Does anyone have any experience/opinions on these welders or other MIGs to help me make a more informed purchase. Jim Narem answered/asked: I'm also interested in MIG welders for sheet metal and roll bar work. I've used the Italian made SIP 110V MIG unit. It works; it was worth $100 (purchased at some close-out sale) but not the $350 that places want retail. It's tough to get parts; even the tips have to be ordered. The wire feed mechanism sucks. I've seen some new Lincoln's on the market; both are wire feed welders with optional MIG kits as opposed to the SP-100 and SP-130 which are purpose build MIG units. Lincoln Weld-Pak 100, 88 amp, 18V @ 20% duty, 110V, $354 w/MIG kit. Lincoln Weld-Pak 125, 130 amp, 20v @ 30% duty, 220V, $556 w/MIG kit. (Prices are Connecticut Home Depot, tax bandit not included) The MIG kits are about $80 each, they have a gas flow regulator, solenoid and (I think) a different gun. Does anyone have any experience with these welders? They seem cost effective compared to the SP-100 and SP-130 but I'm nervous since Lincoln seems to be releasing some home/consumer grade equipment (like their new AC arc welder with the cheezy variable amperage control). There are also several Century MIG units commonly available at large home improvement shops (yup, WELD on that new addition). I've used their AC/DC arc welder and was impressed with its cost/performance. Has anyone used any of the Century MIGs? Ken Clarke answered: I took an evening welding class at a technical high school (10 weeks) and got to try various types of welding (stick, MIG, TIG, and oxy/acetylene. Also got some good tips on safety, and on how to by a MIG welder. The instructor spoke of the \"big three\" in the welding business (Miller, Lincoln, and Hobart). He was a confirmed \"Miller\" man, but we used Lincoln (and Airco) welders in the tech. school. I now think that it makes sense to buy whatever you decide to buy at your favorite welding supply store. The guys there have lots of good advice and if you go with one of the big three, you will not have any problem getting parts and consumables for your welder. I looked around for a while and compared the 110v portable welders by Lincoln and Miller and Hobart. My favorite welding supply house was having a \"package deal\" that included the Hobart Handler 120. Included in the package was the welder, a 2 lb. spool of .024 wire, a Jackson welders mask with the 4x5 face plate (get a number 10 shade), a *good* pair of welders gloves, a 55 cu. ft. tank of shielding gas (C25 which is 25 percent CO2 and 75 percent Argon), a dual-gauge regulator and connecting hose. This was about 1.5 years ago and I believe I paid $625 for the package. The Hobart has been great. It works fine on auto body panels and I have also done work on exhaust systems, mailbox posts, minibike mufflers, lawnmower parts, and am finishing up a trailer axle for a friend this weekend. So, I guess I'm advocating the Hobart, but if you can get a good deal on the Miller or the Lincoln, those would probably be fine, too. A few of the features on the Hobart that I liked were: 1. A \"purge\" feature, that allows you to set the flow rate on the shielding gas without spooling out wire. 2. The wire feed mechanism that lets you set the tension on the drive wheel but also lets you change wire spools without moving the setting. 3. The ergonomics of the unit, the way the wire spool goes in, the way the lid hinges down (not up like the others). 4. Five year warranty on power diodes and SCRs, three years on major components and one year on parts and labor. I would stay away from the Century welder. I don't think it has the quality of the \"big three\". I think you would have trouble getting parts, probably would have to order them. All parts for the big three can be had at local welding supply houses, in-stock. Also, the \"Tweeko\" comment is referring to the gun end of the welder. I hear that it's supposed to be a very common industry-standard type of part. Parts for the Tweeko handle/gun should be available at any welding supply house. Jim Swonger answered: \"Tweako\" is actually Tweco, a manufacturer of MIG and TIG handpieces and such. What this means is that parts are pretty readily available; they're everywhere. For sheet metal welding you'll run nowhere near the maximum heat setting on any machine. On my 160 I'm down on \"2\" for heat. The higher current machines of some of the cheaper brands need to be looked at carefully; some of them have -very- low duty cycles, leading me to believe that the critical parts are not much, if any, better than the cheaper models. The \"purge\" feature is good to have; however if you do not find a machine with it you can add it pretty simply. An auxiliary control switch for the solenoid valve is all it takes, in parallel with the relay that runs off the gun trigger. For serious sheet metal work spot and stitch modes are very nice amenities, allowing you to tack up a large piece with spaced short beads, minimizing distortion and allowing a fast, even hand motion. You can get by without it, but if it comes free or cheap... Quite a while later (26-Sep-1993), mrehmus@ix.netcom.com wrote -- I've owned a Century 90 amp MIG welder for 4 or 5 years now. Never a problem with the unit and I've put three large reels of 0.024\" wire through it. The one time I thought I had a problem the people at Century were very helpful. Century may not be one of the \"big three\" but they have been around for a very long time (mainly they make many of the professional battery chargers sold in this country, so I'm told). ------------ Other comments that have come up from various sources, especially Ken Clarke: Arc welders are often rated for a particular duty cycle, such as 30%. This means you can weld for about 3 minutes at full power, then you have to let the welder cool off for 7 minutes. The cheap units are typically low duty cycle, where the professional units have a high duty cycle. Also, units are often rated at a certain lower amperage where they can safely be operated at a higher percentage; for example, a 200 amp unit might be rated at 50 amps @ 100%, 100 amps at @ 60%, and 200 amps at 30%. Look for some sort of automatic cutoff to protect your investment in case you get carried away. DC systems are nicer than AC systems, especially if you can reverse polarity. AC systems splatter a bit more. DC doesn't as much, and makes a nicer weld as a result. Reversing polarity apparently can direct heat away from, or to, the workpiece; directing it away from a sheet metal weld can reduce warpage. Inverter models run off DC, or rectified line current. Their portability is the main selling point, for field welding where 220V isn't available. For the home or small shop, they are probably overkill. Large spools of wire, or other welding supplies, may corrode before they get used up in a hobby environment. Dry storage is important to preserve them. In late 1995 (10/1), Ernie Leimkuhler (ernieleim@aol.com) wrote: The best of all the baby migs are the Lincoln SP-125, Miller 130, and Hobart Handler 120. All 3 are gas MIGs that can also run flux-core (but why would you want to if you don't have to ?). I own a Handler 120 and have loved it for the last 3 years. I've welded stainless, aluminum and steel with it without a hitch, although the aluminum capability of all the baby migs is pretty limited. For regular steel I use a 75% argon / 25% CO2 mix, but if I need to do a bunch of stainless I swap my 75/25 bottle in for a bottle of Helium-tri-mix. This gives hotter, cleaner welds on stainless and as long as you own your tank it doesn't cost much to swap out for a specific job and then swap back. Eventually I suppose I'll buy another tank, but for now it doesn't seem worth it. Flux-core is only recomended where a sheilding gas is likely to get blown away, such as in-the-field repairs. It is considerably nastier and means a lot of cleanup. BTW instead of buying 10 lb. ($50 - $60) spools of stainless, I buy the little 1.1 lb ($6 - $7 )spools made for spooler guns. This saves a bit of money for small jobs, but if you are doing a lot of stainless, it is cheaper per pound to buy the 10 lb spools. Remeber to match you filler metal on stainless, other wise you can get some funky welds. 308L SS filler wire is used for 304 SS. 316L SS filler wire is used for 316 SS. (The \"L\" stands for elevated temperature stable). The Hobart, Lincoln , and Miller machines all run close to $500 for a package. I would stay away from the cheesier brands on principle allthough some members of this newsgroup have bought them and been quite satisfied. The problem is that the low end companies tend to have probems with warranty repairs and replacment parts, whereas the larger companies have certified repair stations all over the country. All these machines have similar max output amps and tend to max out on 1/4 inch plate steel. For thick sections just preheat to above 400 deg F. -- to which Jim Campbell (campbellj@fdtc.flo.TEC.SC.US) replied: The Chicago Electric systems also have a clever marketing scheme that uses non-standard wire diameters that may commit you to using their systems and materials only. That's probably why their machines are priced rock-bottom, especially through Harbour Freight. [See next comment by Altavoz.

Here we try to shed some light on soldering and brazing. The following was contributed by Tim Kirby around 3/3/93 when the newsgroup was discussing the \"true meaning\" of silver soldering and the distinction between hard and soft solder. : Can anyone remember the \"official\" difference between : Hard & Soft solders ? While browsing for something else entirely, I found my copy of 'Model Locomotive and Marine Boilers' [Argus Press, 1988, ISBN 0-85242-923-1] by Martin Evans (well known in the Model Engineering field, at least in the UK) from which I have gratuitously (and without prejudice) stolen the following extract for your contemplation. As an aside, this is a useful book for those interested in designing and building boilers. Chapter 3, page 55: Silver Soldering and Brazing Soldering and brazing are processes which involve the joining of metals by the addition of molten filler metal of substantially different composition, at temperatures well below their melting point. An important difference between silver-soldering and brazing or welding is that the brazing alloy or filler material must be drawn by capillary forces right through the mating joint surfaces, and not merely deposited at the edges. Soft Solders are generally accepted as including the alloys of low melting point up to about 400 deg. C. They are usually based on Tin or Lead with small additions of antimony and sometimes silver. Hard solders, or silver-solders, are those alloys suitable for soldering which have melting points from 400 deg. C. up to about 800 deg. C. (see BSI 1845/1964) [for those who don't understand that reference, BSI is the British Standards Institute, similar in function to (for example) ANSI. BSI 1845 probably details this stuff in excruciating detail ;-) ... Tim.] Brazing alloys are alloys suitable for brazing (sic) which have melting points from about 800 deg. C. up to about 1000 deg. C. It should however be understood that there is no definite line of demarcation between silver-solders and brazing alloys. The former always contain a proportion of silver, while the brazing alloys generally contain copper, zinc and sometimes tin. Brazing alloys containing copper and phosphorus are also available but these are not recommended for boiler work. 22. What are bolt grades? We frequently see questions regarding bolt grades, so here's a partial list. Please note that just because a bolt is grade 2 does not mean it will break easily. Grading only refers to the minimum strength, not the maximum. Thus, if a machine uses a soft bolt as a safety shear pin, and you happen to replace it with a grade 2 bolt that was actually manufactured to grade 8 specs (but was marked down because too many of the bolts in the lot failed, so the whole lot was marked down) you could create some serious problems. Replace safety-related items with proper stuff! Also beware of improperly-marked forgeries. If your application is critical, test some samples or get certified hardware (not that readers of rec.crafts.metalworking are likely to be building interstate bridges or spacecraft, but it's worth saying). A note on \"strength\" which is actually a complex subject. First, note that there is a maximum \"dry\" tightening torque, and that part of this torque goes to overcoming friction. Thus, a lubricated bolt should be tightened to a lesser torque, as much as 1/2 the dry torque. Note too that bolts are rated as to their minimum tensile strength (presumably before breaking) and also their \"proof\" load, which is I believe the maximum load they can be subjected to as proof of their being grade \"n\", but this load is higher than the maximum suggested operating load. Thus, like automobile mileage figures, use these numbers for comparison only. I suggest reading the below-listed references before building any life-critical contraption. And remember that tensile strength is not the same as shearing strength. And note that there have been many scandals over the years involving manufacturers or distributors who certify hardware as high grade, incorrectly. John M. Peterson kindly typed this in on July 20, 1993, and I have added a few strength figures (jk): Taken from Machinery's Handbook 23 , page 1286. Torque: see Pocket Ref, by Thomas Glover, page 250. Strength: Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 7th ed., page 8-35. This also has a table of safe loads, as well as tensile and shearing strengths. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASTM and SAE Grade Markings for Steel Bolts and Screws ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grade Marking Spec.

What is XYZ made of? Metals 1. What is Brass made of? Brass is a combination of copper and zinc, in approximately the ratio of 2/3 to 1/3, respectively. Sometimes lead (about 3%) is added to improve machinability. 2. What is Bronze made of? Bronze is usually made of copper and tin. However bronze describes any bronze colored alloy even if it doesn't have any tin. Various bronze alloys include silicon, manganese or phosphorus. Mostly bronze is used for bearings. 3. Steels Steel is a refined iron where the impurities carbon, silicon, sulphur and phosphorus are removed and then the iron is combined with carbon and/or chromium and/or nickel. Various other metals may be added to create a nearly infinite variety of steel and steel alloys. A few common steels are discussed below. a. What is CRS? Cold Rolled Steel. b. What is HRS? Hot Rolled Steel. c. What is HSS? High Speed Steel. d. What is stainless steel? Stainless steel is low in carbon but has about 20% chromium. Stainless has a beautiful finish but it is very hard to machine. Both CRS and HRS are mild steels. Mild steels have a low carbon (<.3%) content and therefore can't be hardened. CRS is formed (into bars, rods or angles ...) \"cold\" and therefore has internal stresses inside. Because of these stresses, an intricate part, like a one piece crankshaft, or a heat treated part may distort. CRS has a smooth surface, which requires no additional finishing. The steel stock found in the hardware store or home improvement center is usually CRS. HRS is formed hot so it does not have any internal stresses but it has a rough black scale surface. HRS is a little cheaper, but CRS is easier to find. HRS is used for welding, so a welding shop with steel stock would be a good source for HRS. HSS is a carbon steel (0.3%\n4% C). --------------------------- From: johnri@saturn.wwc.edu (RICHARD ALLAN JOHNSON) \"Damascus\" steel is usually created nowadays when 2 materials with differing carbon content or differing properties such as high and low carbon or high carbon and nickel are forge welded together to form one solid billet. My experience is that in general, Damascus does not stay shaving-sharp as long as straight carbon steel but when it dulls it leaves a microscopic saw edge that will cut flesh like nothing else. --------------------------- From: sfm1@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (SCOTT F. MASTROIANNI) Simply speaking, Damascus steel is an antiquated term popularly used to describe various pattern welded steels. The term was originally used to describe steel from Damascus which had intricate and subtle patterns in it due to the way the steel was made and wrought -- the pattern was a by-product rather than a set goal. These steels contain alternate layers of differing alloy steels that have been forge welded together into a single laminated billet. Frequently these billets are then twisted or physically manipulated in some other manner and/or rewelded to other similar billets. After this laminate steel has been formed into the final shape for which it had been destined, i.e. a knife, object d'art, etc. it is usually etched with some strong acid solution. The etching process will affect the different alloys in different ways; some will etch deeper, producing a noticeable topography, and some will turn darker. The effect is to produce a pattern in the steel of great contrast and beauty. A Damascus or pattern welded steel blade does not have to be any weaker than single alloy, and frequently it is as good if not better in all properties: edge holding, toughness, cutting ability, sharpenability. It is usual practice to use a high carbon and a low carbon alloy as the constituents of a Damascus blade. This unites the best of both worlds: The high carbon steel grants the blade its cutting ability while the low carbon alloy adds to the toughness and shock resistance. It is not necessary to use low carbon alloys at all. Two high carbon steels with greatly differing trace element profiles can be welded to show patterns. I have even read of 440C stainless being forge welded to tool steel -- this can't be an easy process though. In addition, if the pattern in the blade is complex, and many of the laminations cross perpendicular to the edge of the blade, micro-serrations are formed which add to the cutting ability of a well-made Damascus blade. Wayne Goddard, a Master Bladesmith of the ABA and a colleague of Jim Hrisoulas (whose book I recommend for a much better treatise on this subject than I have given here), has a continuing program of testing the properties and performance of forged blades. He has tested hundreds of blades, and found that well made pattern welded blades cut and hold their edges just as well as single alloy blades. The Damascus blades are usually much tougher than all but the strongest (52100 or 5160) single alloy blades. In addition to _The Complete Bladesmith_, I heartily recommend \"The Blade\" magazine to anyone interested in the latest developments in Pattern welded steel and knifemaking in general. --------------------------------- Robert Allen, rja@sun.com, wrote: I've had the opportunity to discuss Damascus manufacturing with Jerry Fisk and John Smith, two makers who do excellent Damascus. Let's see if I can remember the basics: \"Damascus\" as used by most makers today means a layered material made from a mixture of high and low carbon steels. Makers differ the mix according to their pet mixes. A billet of alternating layers is forge welded, then folded and re-folded to the desired number of layers. I've been told that more than 200-300 layers is counter-productive, as at that point you start to get too much carbon migration between the layers and you end up with a homogeneous medium carbon steel. The point of Damascus, I've been told, is that the high carbon component gives up a bit of carbon to the low carbon component. When the blade is hardened, the high carbon component gets fairly tough, which gives you good edge holding, and the low carbon component gets a little harder. The point of all this is that damascus is supposed to have a \"micro-serrated\" edge, which lasts a long time. The theory as I understand it is that the low carbon component wears faster than the high carbon component, giving you an \"aggressive\" edge that can't be beat. The two Damascus blades I have seem to bear this out, beyond what merely varying the the grit on a sharpening stone would do. After forging a Damascus blade, it is etched in one of several acid mixtures, which causes the pattern caused by the layering to emerge. Typically damascus is then blued to bring out the contrast between the layers. Damascus is often modified by forming to create specific patterns in the steel. Some makers have produced small American flags in the pattern. Note that such patterns are produced strictly for the sake of art, not for performance. Popular performance oriented patterns are ladder pattern (has ladder \"rungs\" the length of the blade), San Mai (various makers wrap a carbon steel layer between two damascus layers), random pattern, etc. Some makers claim the different patterns offer different structural or cutting advantages. The patterns are made by machining the billet or blade with the pattern, then re-heating and the material and hammering it flat, etc. There is also cable Damascus which is forge welded cable. Most makers I've spoken with told me their cable Damascus looked good, but wasn't as strong as the other Damascus. Cable Damascus has a unique reptile-scale type pattern. A good Damascus should OUT-perform straight carbon steel in most areas, but particularly in edge holding. Some makers say their Damascus is not as springlike, and so the blades will not spring back as close to true as a carbon steel blade will, under a vise-bending test. I've found that most famous makers are honest about their Damascus. Tim (?) Winkler told me he makes Damascus strictly because it looks nice. Wayne Valakovich (sp?) told me that his normal Damascus isn't as good as his carbon steel, but that his high-density Damascus is better. Fisk and Smith both say their Damascus is better than their carbon steel in most regards, although it still is not as springlike as their high carbon blades. I've cut down small trees with a Fisk Damascus blade, with no apparent wear on the edge. I have a Smith bowie which cuts through blue jeans with zero apparent effort. ------------------- jschmidt@netcom.com suggests that knife blanks may be available from K & G Finishing Supplies, (602) 537-8877. Also everything else you might need to finish a knife. Books that discuss Damascus steel, either historically or how-to: Custom Knifemaking 10 Projects from a Master Craftsman Tim McCreight Stackpole Books 1985 ISBN 0-8117-2175-2 7 1/4\" x 9 1/4\" 222 pg. paperbound ($14.95, $20.50 in Ca. when I got it) A History of Metallography: The development of ideas on the structure of metals before 1890 by Cyril Stanley Smith 1960 -- The University of Chicago Library of Congress Catalog Number: 60-7243 \"DAMASCUS-USA\" distributes a catalog. It says on the cover \"World leader in hand made forged-to-shape Damascus Cutlery Steel. More of our knives are in use world-wide than anyone else's.\" It looks like they mostly sell ready-made Damascus knives but there is a page where you can order Damascus Billets (Bar stock) in any size or pattern. This apparently is a one-man operation, by Dr. Robert Charlton (919) 482 4992. Another source is \"True Grit\", 760 Francis street, Suite N, Ontario, California 91761. The book \"The Complete Bladesmith\" by Jim Hrisoulas has also been recommended. 26. How do I repair/replace this old leather belt? A big problem with some lathes is that the drive belt, or one/some of the belts, are assembled with the lathe and are not meant to be replaced without disassembling the headstock. This is a task that is difficult at best. Older South Bend and others use a flat leather belt, glued or stitched. Newer lathes sometimes use a V-belt in the headstock to transfer power from one set of pulleys to a set of pulleys on the spindle. For V-belts, there is at least one linked replacement. Gates Rubber Company makes \"Nu-T-Link\" belting that can be cut to length, threaded into position, and joined with special T-pins. The pins might get in the way, depending on the application, so be careful to check out clearances before you buy. (ref: HSM Jan/Feb 1992 pg 6-7). You might look in the yellow pages in your area for bearing/belting or other mechanical suppliers. Flat leather belts sometimes just start slipping well before they break. One suggested fix was to apply \"friction tape\" to the pulleys, especially if they are polished. It needs occasional replacement, but is cheap and easy. Another fix is to apply some sort of belt dressing; one person suggested contacting New England Belting in Springfield MA. They may also be able to supply a replacement. Also try Hudson Belting in Worcester Massachussets at (508) 756-0090. A non-leather replacement is called Texalon, made by J.E. Roads & Sons, 2100 West 11th street, Wilmington DE 19899 (phone (302) 655-6513). It is sold through Hermance Machine Company, 178 Campbell Street, Williamsport PA 17701, phone (717) 326-9157, and possibly others. (ref: HSM March/April 1993, pg 8-9). Texalon is cut to length, the ends prepared, and then glued. In March/April 1992 HSM (page 41) another replacement was mentioned, \"Powertwist\" made by Fenner Mannheim, 311 West Stiegel, Mannheim PA 17545-1010. This is made from interlocking segments, and may be available from bearing suppliers such as Industrial Bearing Company. At least for Logan lathes, there is the manufacturer: Logan Actuator Co. 550 Chippewa Road Harvard, IL 60033-2372 (815) 943-9500, (815) 943-6755 (FAX) e-mail: sales@loganact.com web: http://www.loganact.com http://www.lathe.com They may even have belts correctly sized for other brands such as South Bend. I have also heard of stitching a brass cabinet hinge onto a leather belt, then assembling in place (as long as the hinge pin can be secured from dropping out!). Also, per a post 5/17/94, try Page Belting in Concord, New Hampshire. Modern flat multi-grooved belts as used on automobiles can also be nice replacements for old leather belts, assuming you can find one the right size. Measure, and try a local auto-parts store. (HSM Nov/Dec 1998 Page 27) 27. Can I use a drill press as a cheap vertical mill? Sometimes people want to use a drill press with an X/Y table attached as a cheap vertical mill. Will this work? Generally, yes, but you should not do this. The bearings in a drill press are not designed for side loads. This may cause premature failure of the bearings, and may also cause significant sideways deflection and wandering (if you must do this, don't expect finish-quality cuts). If you extend the spindle down very far towards the work, the deflection could be quite severe. Mill spindles are more stout than drill spindles. In some presses, the chuck is held in only by a taper. Side pressure could cause the chuck to fall out. Some milling tools are not designed to be held by a drill chuck, or if your spindle does have a taper, the taper will be wrong (mills usually use either a Morse or \"R\" taper while drills often use a Jacobs taper; check this out before buying any tools). An X/Y table often does not come with finely-marked dials, and may in fact be quite inaccurate. For coarse cuts this may be OK. Note too that a real mill will have controlled Z-axis feed, while on a drill press this too will be quite rough to control. As for how big a cut you can make, or how accurate your setup will be, there is no consensus. You'll have to set it up and try it. Considering the bearing/deflection problems, moderately light cuts would be recommended. Speculation: use end mills, not fly cutters (or at least avoid fly cutters, or be careful). Depending on the setup, a cutter may enter the work, then due to the deflection the cutter might be driven into the work farther, jam, and break itself or the work. An end mill cuts more or less continuously and might not have the same problem. Paul Amaranth\nvolunteered his experience: --- I have only machined soft materials (copper, plexiglass and other plastics). I would not recommend using anything but very light cuts (if at all) in anything harder. As you would expect, I had a number of problems. Fine vertical depth adjustments are difficult. I set the quill stop at the desired depth and held it in place by hand. You could move the table up, but most drill presses seem to use a fairly coarse rack and pinion for the table. I used an endmill, which worked fairly well. Any backlash in your x/y table will get you into a load of trouble. This may not be too serious if you're facing off a surface, but will cause lots of problems if you want to make slots or cutouts with any precision. Backlash may also cause chatter. In summary: this works if it's absolutely the only way you can do it, you don't need a lot of precision and you're working with soft materials. I got around these limitations by buying a real mill. --- Alternatives: If you have a lathe, consider buying/making a milling attachment, if your work size and lathe will allow. Consider buying an inexpensive mill/drill machine if you can't quite afford a mill. In general, some of the same comments apply to buying a mill/drill or other combined unit as opposed to a dedicated machine for each purpose. Mill/drill machines are not as rigid for milling as a pure milling machine, but may be the only alternative before the money runs out. Combinations seem to work adequately for many woodworking applications but metalworking generally requires a lot more force. There is an article \"Milling on a Drill Press\" by Rudy Kouhoupt in the Sept/Oct 1982 HSM, and reprinted in Village Press' \"Projects One\" book. 28. What is involved in building a steam engine? NOTE: see also the FAQ entry in rec.models.railroad on live steam railroad modeling. See also http://livesteaming.digiweb.com, http://edge.edge.net/~vrbass/steamfaq.htm. (with thanks to Tim Kirby and Ian Kirby (no relation)) The creation of working steam engines, be they stationary engines, road engines, marine or rail locomotives, is quite a common hobby throughout the world. Many people who would like to get involved in such modelling are, however, frequently at a loss as to how to start. What follows is a set of simple pointers to get you on board. - Magazines and Journals There are four (English language) magazines that specifically deal with this subject. \"Model Engineer\" and \"Engineering in Miniature\" from the UK \"Modeltec\" and \"Live Steam\" from the USA (they may be available from a local worthwhile model store; alternatively, check the FAQ book list for the publishers) Reading any of these magazines will quickly give a feel for the hobby. - Clubs and Associations They are all over the world. Look through the magazines listed above for club addresses; most if not all of them have the names and addresses of clubs all over the world. If you can't find a club remotely near you, here are a couple of suggestions: Try posting a request on the net! It can be a remarkable resource. Try writing to the editor of one of the magazines. - Scales and sizes Stationary engines are most often tabletop sizes; they can be very decorative and interesting exercises in machining but are not often \"used\" once built. Marine engines are often built as decorative or \"stationary\" models, however you may also find some installed in model boats. Some of the suppliers in the magazines listed above may provide more information about marine engines. Road locomotives are usually referred to purely by scale, most often somewhere in the range of 3/4\" scale (3/4 inch to the foot) to 4\" scale (4\":1'). A farm traction engine in 3/4\" scale will probably be around 12\" or 14\" long - quite handleable by most people. A 4\" scale model is 1/3 full size - big, heavy and arguably no longer \"Model Engineering\", at least with respect to the resources available to the average mortal. Rail locomotive scales can be a little more confusing because of a tendency to refer to them by the rail gauge that they run on. Unfortunately the gauges are not completely standardized for some scales (although one might expect that they would be). The following table lists the most common \"larger scales\" and the gauge lines they run on (based on a nominal 4' 8.5\" so-called standard (USA) gauge track): 3/4\" scale (0.75\":1') = 3.5\" gauge 1\" scale (1.00\":1') = 4.75\" or 5\" gauge 1.5\" scale (1.50\":1') = 7.25\" or 7.5\" gauge There are 10.25\" and 15\" lines as well as smaller (2.5\" gauge, Gauge 1) that are modelled in live steam. Availability of land, track and facilities will often affect a builders choice of scale. Note that the modelling of narrow or broad gauge models introduces another confusion factor - a 1.5\":1' scale model of a prototype that ran on 3'6\" gauge track in real life would result in a track gauge of 5.25\". This would commonly be adjusted to fit on a 5\" or 4.75\" gauge line. - It must cost a fortune and take forever Not necessarily. There are many suppliers in this hobby who can provide as much or as little as you need, from a set of original blueprints for a prototype, through those who can provide scaled drawings of proven models, books giving detailed operation-by-operation procedures on how to create a model, sets of castings that need machining or even ready machined kits that can be assembled on a kitchen table... or they will sell you a complete, ready-to-run model. The amount of money spent will vary typically as a function of how big the model will be, how much work the builder does (as opposed to buying ready-built parts) and what resources the builder has in his/her workshop. Needless to say, the amount of time spent building such a model will be a function of the same things. As a rule of thumb, the more you do yourself, the cheaper it is and the longer it will take you. Reading the classified advertisements in the magazines listed you may be able to pick up a part-complete or secondhand model for less than the cost of the parts new (though you are at the mercy of the workmanship of the builder. Let the buyer beware). - What about boilers? The subject of boilers is complex; each country has its own rules and regulations - which could never be justly covered here. Some pointers, though: + If you build a 'published plan', there is probably a published boiler plan to go with it. This usually means it is a proven design, which is *good*. + Steam clubs will have some sort of regular boiler inspection and test requirement. Talk to the appointed boiler inspector at your club. + If you are in the slightest bit wary or unhappy about building a boiler, *get some help from someone who knows what they are doing*. Some companies will sell you \"standard\" boilers for published designs ready made; there are others who specialize in building custom boilers. You may be able to lower the cost by doing all the preparation work and getting someone else to (braze/weld/whatever) the bits together. + Remember... this is a pressure vessel full of very hot water and steam. You *really* do not want it to fail. You will probably be closest to the boiler if it does... - What's a good book on the subject? There are many, many books available on this and associated subjects; some are general texts, some specialize in particular aspects. A good place to start is (unsurprisingly) read through a couple of issues of the magazines mentioned; most of the publishers (Village Press, TEE, Argus/Nexus) publish and/or sell a number of texts; writing to the publishers should elicit a list of currently available books. Also try some of the suppliers catalogs found in the magazines; A.J. Reeves Ltd., Power Model Supply and Coles Power models all carry books on general topics and specialist areas such as boilers, valve gear etc. - Do you have any other advice? Reading the magazines is all well and good, but try to find someone to talk to who has had some experience - this can not only save lots of frustration but can also lead to lots of very useful shortcuts and even material help. It may mean finding and joining a club, which, if one is considering building a rail vehicle, at least means that there will be somewhere to run it when completed, without then having to build a track too! The first-time builder is strongly recommended to consider choosing a published *model* design (from one of the magazines or plan suppliers) where all the scaling is done, and the finished article will work if built according to the plans. Converting full size prototype drawings to a working scale model is not recommended for the \"normal\" first-timer! As you might expect, the published plans cover some models suitable for the beginner and others best attempted by an experienced builder. Again, we cannot recommend strongly enough getting advice from a club of some sort if you can find one. Ask the supplier if the design was ever serialized in any of the magazines and if the text is available, either as copies, back issues or as a published book - blow-by-blow instructions can be very reassuring, even if you know what you are doing in a machine shop. Choose wisely, so that interest is maintained. In particular with rail models, you need some rail to run it on. Unless you are fortunate enough to have plenty of land and money, you will probably want to run on a club track - find out what your local club has before you build or you may spend several years creating a beautiful working model with nowhere to run it. If there are several gauges available at your track of choice, consider carefully which track you want to be able to run on. 29. How do I anodize aluminum? (pieced together from various sources, including the newsgroup. JK) (note, there is also an explanation of anodizing, and aluminum in general, at http://www.bikepro.com/products/metals/alum.html) First, this is only meant to apply to aluminum. Other metals, such as titanium, niobium, and possibly magnesium and others, can also be anodized. Aluminum oxidizes very quickly, and rapidly forms an aluminum oxide coating that inhibits further oxidization. This coating is useless as is, in terms of protecting the metal, because it is so thin. A thicker coating can be produced by immersing the part in an electrolytic solution and passing an electrical current through it, similar to electroplating. The resulting film is nearly colorless, and can be easily dyed because it is very porous at the molecular level. Then, by placing the part in boiling water, the film's pores can be sealed; the oxide changes from one form to another as a result. To be more specific, parts should be very clean and grease-free. Commercial plants will first clean and etch the surface in a caustic solution, such as lye (sodium hydroxide), followed by a thorough wash. The parts are placed in an acid solution, such as 15-25% sulphuric acid, and connected to the positive source of a power supply (use only aluminum hardware to make the connection; no copper in the solution!). The part(s) comprise the anode, and the cathode is lead (lead sheet, or the whole tank might be lead). Appropriate current is applied, e.g. 1.5 amps per decimeter (3.4 square inches). This lasts 15-25 minutes if no dying is planned, or 45-60 minutes for dying. Dying is the next step, if desired. Since the pores are extremely small, many common dyes will not work. Some wool dyes are known to work, or you can purchase commercial anodizing dyes from an industrial supplier. Typically this involves immersion in the dye solution, which may have to be heated to be effective. (Steve Rayner reports that telescope builders like a black anodizing dye called Nigrosin Biological Stain, which is water soluble and mixed 1 teaspoon full to a quart of water; his bottle is labeled Aldrich 19,828-5 and cost around $35.00 Canadian, for 25 grams). Sealing is then done by putting the part in boiling water, which changes the film from gamma aluminum oxide a hydrated form called boehmite. Boil for about 20 minutes. Another anodizing process involves using chromic acid. This is not suitable for alloys with more than 5% copper. The film is thinner, but very durable. The very thin film is also a benefit when very close tolerances must be maintained. However, because chromic acid is a very nasty chemical, its use on an amateur basis is discouraged, and its commercial use may be closely regulated. Anodizing is sensitive to the type of alloy. For example, alloys for die casting have a lot of silicon, which makes it pour and mold well, but it makes anodizing almost impossible. By all means, find a few references and read them carefully before attempting anodization. If at all possible, try it out on scrap pieces before attempting it on your masterpiece. Be sure to flush the part completely to remove remaining acid. An alternative is to use a commercial firm to do the anodizing. Some net folks report they can be a bit rough to deal with, as they may be more used to dealing with large jobs and may not appreciate a home machinist with a single 5-inch part. Look in the phone book under anodizing, plating, or electroplating. Some have reported using a lye solution to treat the surface, which yields a fairly uniform fuzzy surface, that may be acceptable as a final surface without further treatment. Don't use a strong solution or the aluminum will disappear too fast; do this in a well ventilated area, as hydrogen gas is emitted, stay away from flames/sparks, and remember that lye will eat people as well as aluminum! The resulting surface can be dyed, or painted with a chromate primer. (One tablespoon of lye per pint of water has been suggested). Another alternative is a product called Aluminum Black from Birchwood Casey, which is often advertised in model railroading magazines, and may also be available via gun stores (it is in the Brownells catalog). Brownells also lists a nickel plating solution for aluminum, though it appears non-trivial to use. Dyes: On 4/22/97, vantonova@aol.com suggested using the cyan ink from HP color ink-jet printer cartridges as a blue anodizing dye (the yellow and magenta didn't work out well).

How to Anodize Aluminum, Popular Science February 1963, pages 144-146. ADDENDUM: On May 16, 1996, Patrick M. Riggs (pmr0811@tamu.edu) posted this nice description of how *he* anodizes aluminum, and copper as well. JK A long time ago, I came to this newsgroup asking for answers on how to anodize aluminum, and nobody really had advice. Since then, of course, I've seen lots of suggestions. In any case, at that point I promised to post if I had any results, and never posted except to mention my success. Well, while there are probably better methods out there, this is what worked for me, and has continued to work for me. I hope this is helpful. BTW, it has been a while, and Sandoz chemical is now called Clarion corp. Their proprietary anodal ms-1 is basically a weak nickel acetate solution. As to where to get sulphuric acid, I wouldn't know, since I work at a university where such things are readily available. I hope this helps, and thanks to those who gave me advice along the way. Oh yeah, and be careful . . . sulphuric acid is dangerous (I have \"bad lab practice\" reminders in more than one pair of shorts -- not that I recommend wearing shorts in the lab . . .) and eats an awful lot of otherwise sturdy materials. Also, beware of the high currents. I, of course, take no responsibility for anything (and that seems to be my problem in general). Hard anodizing: Sulfuric acid at 13% by volume, at a temperature of 3 degrees C. Note that the temperature is not overly important, so long as it is close. The current density should be ~15 amps/square foot. The aluminum piece should stay in the bath for at least 2 hours, with four hours being optimum. As an alternative to hard anodization, leave all conditions the same except for the temperature, which should be 70-75 degrees C. The difference in the two procedures is the thickness and quality of the anodic layer. Hard anodization leave the material more absorptive. The cathode, or negative lead, should be lead, with the anode to cathode proportion being about 1:1. For dyeing the object, there are two options: Rit dye: Rit is a standard wool dye, which can be purchased at any grocery store. This method is both inexpensive and offers a wide variety of colors. The drawbacks are that Rit, an organic dye, is not light fast, and will fade in direct sunlight. With Rit, simply prepare a bath of about 50ml/litre at about 70 degrees celsius. One hour minimum is required, with the preferable duration matching the anodization time. Black MLW: Black MLW can be purchased from Sandoz Chemical (my contact was Ron Rupple (214) 423-1674, the sales rep for texas. The company is based at (704) 331-7000.) The price is between $15/lb and $60/lb (don't have an exact quote, but this is the range of prices for all of their black dyes). Small test quantities can be obtained. Black MLW is favorable because it is a) light fast in the visible (being inorganic), and b) a rather flat black. It's drawbacks are expense (a minimum order is 5 lbs, which is an awful lot of dye), and requires special working procedures (the dust is hazardous to the lungs). Black MLW is, however, simpler, and more convenient, to use. The temperature should be between 51 and 60 degrees C. The duration being 5-10 minutes depending on quality of blackness desired. The concentration (keep this in mind before ordering 5+ pounds) is 10 grams/litre. Sealing: The sealing process hydrates the porous anodic layer, closing it, protecting it, and sealing in the dye. For most applications, sealing is desirable. Supposedly, this process can be done with boiling water, but I've only managed the following. 1) Simply leave the piece in the dye bath, and boil the dye bath for one hour. This will require removal of the excess dye afterwards and is not generally recommended. 2) 2% anodal MS-1 (again from sandoz chemical (though, nickel acetate should work as a substitute). The temperature of the bath should be between 70 and 87 degrees C, with a duration of 5-20 minutes (depending on porosity and thickness of coating . . . longer never hurts). Note that after each step, the object should be rinsed with deionized water to avoid contamination. I did this all with distilled water, though deionized water should still work. Important information about the piece. The purity of the aluminum is important. The higher the silicon content, the less likely the process is too work. Also, the product should be newly machined (for a shinier, more professional finish) or sandblasted (for a flatter, though less even, finish). All oil, dirt, glass beads, etc, must be removed prior to the anodization process. This can be done by thorough cleaning with acetone and methonal (soap is dangerous, since phosphates in the solution tend to negate the anodization process). For better cleaning, immerse the part in 1 tsp/200 litres NaOH (be careful). For small parts this is undesirable, since the NaOH actually removes aluminum. After this bath, a smutty brown finish is obtained. To remove, rinse the part, and soak in a 10% nitric acid solution until a satin finish is obtained. Copper anodization: While aluminum anodization is typically clear (depending on the alloy and the process used (there are various other processes using different acids, the most common being chromic and oxalic), copper, at least via this process, anodizes black. The desired voltage is 6 volts across the circuit. The bath should be 120 grams/ litre of NaOH. The temperature MUST be between 82 and 99 degrees C or the process will not even begin. The duration of the anodization process is 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending again on the quality of black desired . . . more time, flatter black. The cathode is Steel in a 1:1 ratio. Again the piece must be dirt/ grease free. This process will also work for brass, though it is shinier. Also, different colors may appear under the black, depending on the brass. For both of these metals, remember that they oxidize quickly in air (which is not the same as the anodized layer . . . though in aluminum, this layer is also protective). Therefore, they should be anodized as soon as possible after machining and preparing. ADDENDUM: On August 12, 1995, Jerry Kimberlin (kimberln@crl.com) posted the following on blackening aluminum. In this case it is not an anodizing finish, but this seemed to best place to stick the information! JK There have been several postings about blackening aluminum recently. I wrote an article for *Live Steam* magazine back about 1977 on the subject and have modified it a little since then. I do use it myself and thought that it would be of interest to the newsgroup. So: BLACKENING ALUMINUM by JEROME KIMBERLIN There are several ways to color aluminum black and among them are black anodizing and paint. You could rub dirt into the aluminum surface, I suppose, but of all the methods, I think chemical coloring is the superior method. It is certainly cheaper, faster, and home use allows the model engineer greater flexibility in the timing of his decoration of models in progress. Surface preparation of parts to be colored black is all important as any irregularities are not covered by this finish. Paint does build up and fill in scratches and other voids. Castings, however, should look like castings if the prototype used castings, so surface finish is always adjustable to the builders idea. The point here is to emphasize that this blackening technique will not cover up mistakes. You will need three chemicals. These are: Nitric Acid, Copper Nitrate, and Potassium Permanganate. You will also need some good quality water - either distilled or deionized. I will give the dimensions of the mixture in both metric and English units so that both types of measures are accommodated: Take: water 3 quarts 750ml Add Acid 1/2 oz 5ml Add Copper 3 oz 25gm Add Permanganate 1 oz 10gm Add Water to make 1 gal 1 liter Obviously you will have to make up more or less solution to fill the container you will use to color aluminum parts and the parts to be colored should be completely covered by the solution. You should use a glass or plastic container. A metal container will poison the solution prematurely. At 75 degrees F (24 C) temperature, the blackening process will take about 15 minutes using a fresh solution. If it takes longer it means the solution is deficient in one of the components. Usually, copper nitrate and nitric acid need be added. Aluminum is a strange metal to most of us. While we cannot see it, the surface of a newly machined or cleaned piece of aluminum combines with oxygen in the air to form a self protecting coating of aluminum oxide. This happens within minutes. If this surface continues to grow (get thicker) the blackening solution described here will not work satisfactorily. Thus, the piece to be colored should be cleaned just before immersing into the coloring solution. In my experience, glass bead blasting is a superior way to clean the aluminum surface and the choice of bead size determines surface finish. Once the bead blasting has been accomplished, the beads can be washed off with hot water and the aluminum piece immersed in the blackening solution. I recommend that the time between blasting (cleaning) and immersion in the blackening solution be less than two hours. I once waited five hours and was disappointed in the results. Once the blackening process has been completed, wash off the workpiece with tap water, drain and spray with WD-40 or other water displacing oil. There are a number of ways to clean aluminum satisfactorily. It is possible to simply sand the surface clean, or scrub it clean with an abrasive. One can also chem clean aluminum by degreasing the workpiece then dipping it into lye (Draino, for instance) for a few minutes or seconds as required, then rinsing. The shape of the workpiece and the model engineer's facilities often dictate what method of surface preparation will be used. Model engineers wishing to use this solution to blacken aluminum castings or other parts should be aware that the chemical components may be hazardous. While the solution itself is not particularly dangerous it can make your hands purple, so use rubber or plastic gloves. Potassium Permanganate is classified as an oxidizer even though dilute solutions of it are used throughout the world to sterilize vegetables used in salads, etc. Concentrated nitric acid is just plain bad. The technique for using it is to pour out a little in a glass container and then use an eye dropper to transfer the liquid to a measuring container when the volume wanted is small, such as that described here. Nitric acid also turns your hands yellow, hurts, and removes fingerprints. A good way to avoid eye damage is to wear a face shield such as the one you should be wearing when working in front of your grinder. ADDENDUM: On July 4 1997, Dave Sage (dsave@inforamp.net) posted a lengthy description of how he anodizes at home -- I have received a few requests to explain the process of anodizing at home. I have had very good success so I'll pass the method I use along for others. I'll leave the source of supply of chemicals and materials up to you because I did a lot of searching and then begged most of them and even I will be in trouble getting more when I run out of them. The fine print: Of course I assume no responsibility for anyone's safety in following this procedure. The first thing to do is go the local hardware supplier and get a cheap range hood ($35) they have a nice light too - nice to see what your doing. I mounted mine on a bench mounted stand and put a piece of flexible dryer vent hose on it to point it out the basement window. The fumes are pretty nasty - probably sulfuric acid vapor - and even a little of it will cause coughing and lung irritation for some time. There isn't much given off and with the vent there is no problem and no sign of any smells outside the hood area. I also use a respirator if I need to get my head in close for a view of the process or I hold my breath. I intend(ed) to improve on the equipment used but since it worked so well with the quick prototype setup I have, I left well enough alone for now. I purchased a Rubbermaid plastic contained about 18\" long about 10\" wide and about 8\" deep. I then went to my scrap metal dealer and got some sheet lead about 1/16 thick and cut it into long strips. One strip goes over the edge at the long end of the container, down inside, across the bottom and back up and over the edge on the other end. This bit over the edge helps to hold the lead in the container and it's handy for clipping the power connection to (large battery clips). There is a second strip making a (flat) ring around the inside of the container below the proposed liquid line. The ring and the strip are soldered together at both ends for electrical continuity. I used a big 150 watt iron used for stained glass work for that operation and any regular solder. Don't use regular fasteners. Everything must be aluminum or lead (so they tell me). I will add that I have no idea if all of this lead is necessary. A single plate at one end may be all that is necessary. I just thought it a good idea that current can flow from all directions to the part which will be hanging in the bath to avoid \"shadows\". I have also heard that aluminum is also acceptable as a cathode. Aluminum may be easier to work with, the lead is very heavy and floppy and you have to be careful when you turn the contained over or the lead tends to sag. Anyway that's what I have and I'm sticking with it. I just happen to know someone in the plating business, so obtaining sulfuric acid was no problem. I also think you can get it from Auto supply houses - they may have it around for putting into car batteries. NEVER ADD WATER TO ACID ADD ACID TO WATER ALWAYS USE THE PROPER SAFETY EQUIPMENT, ETC. ETC. ALWAYS STORE ACID IN AN APPROVED CONTAINER. Wear old clothes - no matter how careful you think you've been you will find a few holes in you pants after you do the next laundry. Make a solution of acid that has a specific gravity of 1100. You can use a regular car battery hydrometer to measure this. It's not too critical. This would be approx. the concentration in a discharged battery. I don't recommend using old car battery acid as it probably has other chemical in it that may mess up the anodizing. Make enough of this to fill the Rubbermaid container to a safe level. So far I'm just using a regular 12 volt car battery charger as a power supply. Although the one I'm using is one of these automatic jobbies that shuts off when the battery is charged, I don't recommend this type because it tends to be fooled by the anodizing setup and shuts off, or quickly clicks on and off and is generally a pain in the butt. Just use a regular type charger - maybe one that has a 3amp and 10amp range. For good measure I put a very large capacitor of about 20,000 micro farads across the output - this obtained from a local electronics surplus house. Just make sure the cap is rated for at least 25 volts. I'm not sure this is necessary and I had good success without it too but I do know that battery chargers are not a filtered supply and I just thought getting rid of the ripple might make things better. The negative lead of the supply and capacitor goes directly to a clip connected to the lead liner in the container. In series with the positive lead I put a 25 watt rheostat of about 2 ohms to control the current. Some people say a piece of resistance wire can be used here. I had the rheostat - so I used it. The system works without it but I found that if the current to the parts in the container gets over more than a couple of amps I was having trouble with the electrical connection going bad and the connecting leads were anodizing and the part wasn't. Since the battery charger isn't variable the resistor was necessary. It does get very hot though so be careful. An anodized surface is non conductive and if the connection goes bad between the part and the wire used to suspend it then the wire anodizes and insulates itself from the part. This is the single biggest problem I have with my set up. As I mentioned the parts to be anodized must be suspended in the acid solution so as not to touch the lead at the sides of the container. I just used a simple wood stick across the length of the container with a few screws spaced along its length to wind the wire to and to give a point to clip the positive power lead. The more polished the piece is BEFORE you anodize it the nicer it looks after. I usually shine the pieces up until I can see my face in them. Anodizing will not cover any sins. THE WIRE USED TO SUSPEND THE PARTS MUST BE ALUMINUM. I understand copper or steel will contaminate the solution and the part to be anodized. For this I purchased a roll of regular aluminum wire feed welding machine wire available at any welding supply or home depot. It seems to work, I couldn't find anything else although it may be the source of some of my connection problems. It is of a very hard alloy of aluminum and would rather break than form to the part. But I use it anyway. Use a good long length of the wire and wrap it very tightly through any available holes in the part. Be aware that at the point the wire touches you won't get any anodizing - hence no color if you dye it, so don't wrap the wire around the part proper. Double up the wire and twist it tight with pliers. Like I said before this electrical connection is my biggest problem. If anyone has any way to improve this situation let me know. You should wear rubber gloves from now on as you should not touch the part else you get a greasy spot that won't anodize well. First you must clean, clean, clean the parts to be anodized. I use laundry soap because it cuts grease and is a bit abrasive. I then put the piece in a plastic container and with a brush, use a bit of caustic cleaner (again obtained from my plating shop friend). I think a very mild lye or caustic soda solution would work here. The parts tend to bubble a bit with white foam, but it DOES NOT etch the surface and I don't leave it on more than a few seconds. This step may not be necessary if you scrub the part well with soap and water. The purpose is to be sure there is no oil on the part. Rinse the parts thoroughly. I then like to leave them submerged in water because they dry in the air and sometimes look a bit white - something that LOOKS like it may affect the anodizing. The parts are then suspended from the wood stick and screw by the wire in the acid so as to be completely covered but not touching the sides of the container. Connect the positive of the supply - from the rheostat and capacitor - to the screw and wire holding the part(s). I'll assume one part is being anodized here because the description is easier. Do some calculation of total surface area in square FEET of the part - DON'T FORGET ALL SURFACES - inside and out, edges etc. Turn on the power and measure the current. I usually find it to be around 3 amps or so. If it goes way high change the rheostat setting or select a lower output from the battery charger. Like I said before the electrical connections from the wire to the part are the biggest problem and I find that if the current gets much over 3 amps the connection fails and the wire - not the part- anodizes - actually it corrodes away to nothing and the part falls off. The part should soon begin to have small bubbles all over. If not, and the wire does, you have a bad connection. I usually have the least problem with leaving the current to each part at about 2-3 amps. It takes quite a bit longer to get the job done but with less headaches. Jiggle the part occasionally so you don't have gas bubbles lingering and shielding the parts from the acid solution. The rule of thumb I have been using is to apply 900 amp/minutes per square foot of area. Sounds like a lot but for a 1.5 inch diameter by 4 inch long piece of bar (I hope I get this right) 3.14 x 1.5 x 4 = 18.8 square inches for the sides plus 3.14 x .75^2 = 1.8 square inches for the ends. equals = 20.6 square inches total area There are 144 square inches in a square foot so... 20.6/144 = .143 square feet of surface The part is drawing 3 amps so 900/3 = 300 amp minutes per square foot required. 300 x .143 = 42.9 minutes. (sounds about right) This is only a rough guide. In reality I start with this and then watch the part. If the part was nice and shiny when it started you can watch the part as it anodizes and I have found that the part turns ever so slightly a milky lemony yellow color. Definitely not as bright and shiny as it started. This would be the aluminum oxide layer buildup. If I hadn't told you this you might not notice, its very slight. But I have found that if my time estimates are approaching and the part looks this way it always seems to work out well and takes the dye nicely. Not scientific but seems to work. After the anodizing bath I immediately put the parts in a bucket of water or they can stay in the acid with the power off - but don't let them dry. I just like to use the same fume hood while I do the dyeing so I have to remove the acid container and empty it out etc. Keep em wet. Sorry, I won't recommend a source for the dyes but I got mine as samples from a dye supplier. Again I found this guy through my plating friend, although I found a lead on my own by calling chemical companies and asking for their reps. You can try your local anodizer but for some reason they guard their suppliers - maybe because they know the procedure is simple and they don't want you to take business away by doing it yourself. Sandoz chemicals makes a black dye, maybe they can put you on to your local rep and you can go from there. I don't want everybody bugging my supplier for samples - you'll mess up my credit for more :-) An interesting story - before I had the bright idea for aluminum wire (described below) I called a local anodizer to see if I could beg or buy some aluminum wire from him. He took two days to call me back and then quoted me a price of $30 for about ten feet of wire. I said aluminum not gold !! I kept looking. In any case find a supplier of dyes and ask for samples. The dyes are powder and I got a small amount of black, red, green, blue, gold, bronze, and yellow. Some of them are tremendously expensive and you only need about three tablespoons to make a gallon of dye, so you don't need to buy a pound for several hundred dollars that would last a thousand years of home use. Black is about $50 per pound - red is a couple of hundred (I was told). The dye solution is re-usable and apparently you just add a bit more powder when say your black turns a bit blue. I haven't yet. Mix the dye according to specs. The solution is supposed to have a particular PH and I got this with some litmus paper strips and found that it just meant adding a couple of tablespoons of household vinegar to the gallon of dye. It MIGHT be necessary to be accurate here but I DOUBT IT. I use an old two gallon stainless cooking pot and a one element hot plate for the dying step. DO EVEN THINK OF DOING THIS IN THE WIFE'S KITCHEN. The dye is very nasty stuff and is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of anything it touches. Stainless is the name of the game here. My dye instructions say the dye should be at 130 degrees (I think). The important thing is not to heat it anywhere near boiling or the pores in the oxide layer of the part will seal up and the dye will not take. The part almost immediately takes the black dye I have although I believe about 20 minutes is recommended in the solution with the part being stirred to keep fresh dye moving around. After dyeing the parts, the parts should be put into clean boiling water and boiled for about another 1/2 hour. Keep the water boiling. This seals the part. I have heard on this list that there is something that should be in the water to aid the sealing process. Maybe someone could repeat this. I don't use anything and I have good results. My black parts come out looking like they have been professionally black lacquered. In fact much better that I've seen from a lot of commercial places. I haven't quite determined how much parts should be machined undersized in order to maintain fit. I do know that I had a piece of tubing that was machined to fit inside another and I had a nice sliding fit before anodizing and they wouldn't fit afterward. I had a hell of a time hand sanding he one piece down to fit (600 paper). The surface was VERY HARD, but I did manage it and the part is still relatively shiny. I probably only took off about 1/4 thou, I don't know. That's about it - give it a try. It's a pretty forgiving process. I'm sure I'll hear about all the stuff I'm doing wrong from some of the commercial anodizers out there. It was more of an experiment for me - one that I'll keep cause it works so well. Just be careful eh !! (Canadian) Dave Sage [a few more questions and answers regarding Dave's article]: > If it comes out poorly, is > there a way to reverse the process? As long as i've not sealed > it, does it come off with some other chemical? Even after the part has been dyed the whole mess can be removed with a caustic (soda) solution (or lye I suppose), with a corresponding dulling and etching of the finish. [he also wrote, responding to a similar question]: Anodizing is VERY EASILY stripped off using a mild Caustic solution - aka household lye. Start weak and watch for the dye colour to disappear. Watch carefully, the caustic also eats aluminum quite nicely. Flush well with water and wash with dish soap. The part may be a milky or stained colour after but the re-anodizing process will (in my experience) return it to an even finish again. You could polish the part first as well with 0000 steel wool and/or 600 wet/dry paper. [and one more question/answer] > When you are anodizing Al you have to attach the peice to the > power supply. Does this leave a blemish on the article. You must use aluminum wire or some sort of aluminum clip. Never use steel, copper or anything else. It will disintigrate quickly. Assuming you use aluminum wire, the blemish is very small and usually un-noticeable. Have a look at some commercially anodized piece you may have around. The marks are there somewhere and may only be the size of a pin prick. There is always more than one because the wire is usually wrapped in and around the piece. The size of the blemish is only as large as the contact point between the wire and the piece. Since the wire is round and it usually touches the piece on an edge or something, the point of contact is actually SMALLER than you think. In a lot of cases there is usually a hole in the piece and if you put the wire through the hole the point of contact will be on the edge of the hole. If a screw is normally in the hole it will hide the mark. > I have read about Alligator clips, Wrapping the peice in wire, > drilling and tapping a hole to attach to. What is the best > method for not leaving any marks or blemishes. In almost everything I have built so far I usually have a threaded hole somewhere. I find that the best and simplest connection method is to FORCE thread the aluminum wire into the threaded hole. In this way the blemish is large but is then inside the hole and not visible when assembled. You must understand that the aluminum wire I have is probably # 14 guage and is VERY soft aluminum. So soft that it can be stretched and broken so it threads easily into 6061 T6 tapped holes without damaging them. Sometimes doubling the wire over first is necessary to make it large enough to thread in. Failing that, the wire can be wrapped and twisted but the connection MUST be VERY tight and if you jiggle the part while it is hanging on the wire and you feel it move the connection is not tight. > assuming I want to anodize a square block of alloy with no where > convenient to clip to This type of shape is difficult. Just do your best to wrap the wire around it - perhaps in several directions and twist the wire tight. The blemishes will only be at points of contact. As a point of interest - in applications where VERY large numbers of small parts need to anodized and blemishes are not a big concern the parts are piled into an aluminum cage and a weight is put on the top of the pile. The parts are then all connected to each other tightly by multiple points of contact where they touch. They all anodize just fine except where they touch. After dyeing the parts are examined. If there are any with unacceptably large blemishes they are simply stripped of their anodizing with caustic solution and re-anodized with the next batch. Archive-name: metalworking-faq/part6 This is the FAQ for rec.crafts.metalworking. It is in several pieces to keep the overall size of each part below the limits imposed by some news systems. This is part 6 of 11. Generally, units below are United States dollars, degrees Fahrenheit, and all the other silly backwards units we Americans still use. Sorry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. Rust! How do I deal with rust? Some machinists live in areas where rust prevention is important, such as those in humid areas. There are various steps to reduce the problem, and sometimes several steps need to be taken simultaneously. Here are some ideas from previous posts on the topic: Doug White\nwrote, on 2 Jun 94: I have a lot of expensive tools/toys that I have a LOT of trouble keeping from rusting. Over the years, I have tried many different tricks and products, and I've summarized my results below. The paper is called VPI Paper (Vapor Phase Inhibitor), and it's available from Brownell's (address in FAQ), as are raw crystals. You want to make sure that the 'dusty' side of the paper faces the tool, and don't be surprised if some plastics (vinyl tool pouches) end up with a funny white surface. It doesn't seem to hurt the plastic, but it's disconcerting until you get used to it. The tools will stay rust free much longer if they are sealed in a tight box, or a zip lock bag. In theory, you should replace the paper annually if it's exposed to the air on a semi-regular basis. There is also another similar product called Zrust. This comes in a number of forms, typically plastic 'cartridges' and flat plastic squares. They are also available from Brownells, but if you think you are going to be using a lot of this stuff, you're better off locating a dealer and buying direct. The cartridges can handle an entire tool box or cabinet, and the little squares are good for smaller containers. Once again, the tools should be stored in some sort of container. The more airtight it is, the less frequently you will need to replace the rust-inhibitor. A company called Hydrosorbent sells silica gel desiccant in several convenient sizes. The nice thing about these is that they have an indicator to tell when they're saturated, and you can 'recharge' them in the oven. I use the small aluminum packs for some of my tools, and all of my target pistols. There is a new company that makes the same sort of thing in a plastic case that you can recharge in the microwave. If anyone knows where to get these, I'd love to find out. I also use a dehumidifier in my basement. I live near Boston, and in the summer when my basement is still cool, the relative humidity goes through the roof. I have a 25' x 30' basement, and a 25 pint capacity dehumidifier can keep the RH down to around 50% without running continuously. It's best if you have a drain, so you don't have to remember to empty the bucket all the time. Mine costs me about $20/month in electricity for 3-4 months each year. If you go looking for a dehumidifier, get one that has a freeze-up cutout, and a hose connection on the machine, not the tank. This saves a lot of space, and gets the water source up higher for easy draining. As it is, I have mine up on top of a small set of shelves so that it will drain into the laundry sink. Check Consumer Reports for the most efficient model you can get, it will pay for itself in electricity in short order. Brownells also used to sell 'Gunsmith's Soap', which was supposed to neutralize the pH of your skin before handling things. They discontinued this before I could get a chance to try it, but I have found that washing your hands to remove salts from perspiration can help. If anyone knows a source for 'Gunsmiths Soap', I'd love to try some. The one last trick I use when I'm handling something I don't want to rust (like when I'm disassembling a target pistol) is to wear cotton \"inspection gloves\" that have been lightly sprayed with a thin rust preventative oil. This simultaneously prevents me from etching things with my corrosive perspiration, and lightly coats everything I touch with oil. If you are concerned about what the oil does to your skin, you can wear latex gloves underneath the cotton. It doesn't work well for really delicate work, and you have to be careful not to let anything slip through your fingers. There are several spray treatments that work well for storage. My current favorite was developed by Boeing, and is called BoeShield T-9. It's available from many marine supply houses. After the carrier evaporates, it leaves a thin surface film that does an excellent job of protecting steel from corrosion. ================================== Doug White\nfollowed up on the above, on Fri, 3 Jun 1994, with these addresses: Hydosorbent Co. Box 437 Ashley Falls, MA 01222 (413) 229-2967 Sells Silica Gel descant packages in the following sizes: 750 gram aluminum canister, 6\"H x 4\"D, protects 57 cubic ft., $24 360 gram carton, 2\" x 4\" x 5\", protects 27 cubic ft., $10.75 40 gram aluminum box, 4\" x 2\" x 1/2\", protects 3 cubic ft., $5.95 26 gram packets, 2 12\" x 4\", protects 2 cubic ft., $12.00/10 All but the packets are re-chargeable in an oven. Post-paid, but $2.00 shipping charge. They take MC/VISA Northern Instruments Corp. Lake Industrial Park 6680 N. Hwy. 49 Lino Lakes, MN 55014 (612) 784-1250 These folks sell a variety of VPI products. The two most useful ones are their Zerust Vapor Capsules and Plastabs. The capsules are plastic and have and adhesive strip to stick them into tool chests, machine tool cabinets etc. The Plastabs are small squares cut from a 1/16\" yellow sheet. The capsules come in several sizes, and are rated by radius of protection, and lifetime: VC-1-1, 1' protection radius for 1 year VC-2-1, 2' protection radius for 1 year VC-2-2, 2' protection radius for 2 years VC-6-2, 6' protection radius for 2 years The only ones I have a price on is the VC-2-1, which were $5 each. The protection life varies with the degree to which the container is sealed. The capsules have a label to mark when they were installed so you know when to replace them. Considering the cost, you may be better off with the silica gel canisters. They will need recharging more often, but have an indicator. I couldn't find any detailed literature on the Plastabs, but I bought a sack with over 500 1/2\" squares for $60. They are much easier to use than VPI paper for small tools and parts. I just toss one or two into a zip lock bag of small tool case. These are sold in the 3/4\" size by Brownells as 'Rust-Blox' (see below), where they claim they are good for 300 cubic inches. Brownells wants $27.20 for 100, which is a good bit more expensive than buying them in bulk from the Zerust people. You'll need to call them to find a local distributor. The shelf life is probably limited, even well sealed in a plastic bag, so if you don't need a lot, Brownells may still be cheaper. Brownells Inc. 200 S. Street Montezuma, IA 50171-9989 (516) 623-5401 This is a gunsmith supply house, and sells a lot of good tools and other gadgets that even non-gunsmiths can use. They have an extensive range of rust preventing supplies. They sell the Hydrosorbent canisters for slightly less than Hydrosorbent does, and they carry the VPI tablets in small (but more expensive) quantities than N. Instruments. They also sell VPI paper and Cosmoline (THE original GI rust preventative grease). The paper comes in 12\" sq sheets, and can protect 1 cubic ft. for 2 years MINIMUM. Typically, it lasts much longer. They carry half a dozen varieties of aerosol rust preventatives, greases etc. Stock # 415-100-040 40 gram silica gel cartridge $5.50 415-100-360 360 gram silica gel carton $9.95 415-100-750 750 gram silica gel canister $22.50 084-058-050 50 Rust-Blox Vapor Tabs $15.70 084-058-100 100 Rust-Blox Vapor Tabs $27.20 084-031-010 VPI Paper, 10 sheets, 12\" x 12\" $4.20 084-031-010 VPI Paper, 50 sheets, 12\" x 12\" $14.88 I think that exhausts everything I know about rust prevention. I've been fighting the battle ever since I moved from New Mexico 24 years ago, and I hope this can save someone some trouble. Doug White MIT Lincoln Laboratory ===================================================== If the parts are small enough for that treatment then you can use \"Blue Bags\". They are made by Bianchi ostensibly to store handguns in, but I find that any rustable metal parts are protected by them. They have zip lock style tops and come in several sizes. I believe they also sell some in rifle sizes but without the zip lock closure. ===================================================== Gun Tests magazine has had 3 different articles on rust prevention (July 1990, April 1991, June 1994). Some of their favorite products were Outers Metal Seal, Hoppe's Gun Grease, Pachmayr's PRP Rust Preventative Compound, Brownells Polar Active Rust Preventative No. 2, Brownells LTS-1, Shooters Choice Rust Prevent, RIG Universal, Pro-CT-Oil, Boeshield T-9, CRC Marine Heavy Duty Corrosion Inhibitor No. 06026, Specialty Marine Coatings ProMet, Cortec VCI-368, and Northwest Anti-Corrosion A-120. ===================================================== For rust removal, the most common suggestion was Naval Jelly by Duro, available at many hardware stores. It contains dilute phosphoric acid as its main ingredient. Be prepared to apply a proper preventive after removal, as the metal will be left in a vulnerable condition. The following is a FAQ on electrolytic rust removal written by Ted Kinsey. Please also read the followup by Bill Gustafson. (I have no idea what happened to his point #3, it came in that way). Mon Feb 05 13:14:29 1996 From: kinsey@uno.cc.geneseo.edu (kinsey) Subject: Electrolytic Rust Removal The Electrolytic Rust Removal Ted Kinsey I have had a couple of requests for this recently and there are a lot of new subscribers, so here it is again. I hope I have covered all the points so we don't start the thread again. Q. What is the method? A. A technique for returning surface rust to iron. It uses the effect of an small low voltage electric current and a suitable electrolyte (solution). Q. What advantages does the method have over the old standbys, like vinegar, Coke, muriatic acid, Naval Jelly, wire brushing, sand blasting etc. ? A. These methods all remove material to remove the rust, including un-rusted surfaces. With many, the metal is left with a pickled look or a characteristic color and texture. The electrolytic method removes nothing: by returning surface rust to metallic iron, rust scale is loosened and can be easily removed. Un-rusted metal is not affected in any way. Q. What about screws, pivots, etc that are rusted tight? A. The method will frequently solve these problems, without the need for force, which can break things. Q. Is it safe? A. The solutions used are not hazardous; the voltages and currents are low, so there is no electrical hazard. No noxious fumes are produced. The method is self limiting: it is impossible to overclean an object. Q. Where did this method come from? A. Electrolysis is a standard technique in the artifact restoration business. I wrote this up for the Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association a few years back. Most of the tool collectors around here use it. Q. What do I need? A. A plastic tub; a stainless steel or iron electrode, water and washing soda (NOT baking soda!!) and a battery charger. About a tablespoon of soda to a gallon of water. If you have trouble locating the washing soda, household lye will work just fine. It's a tad more nasty -- always wear eye protection and be sure to add the lye to the water (NOT water to lye!!!) The solution is weak, and is not harmful, though you might want to wear gloves. Q. How long does the solution last? A. Forever, though the loosened rust will make it pretty disgusting after a while. Evaporation and electrolysis will deplete the water from the solution. Add water ONLY to bring the level back. Q. What about the iron electrode? A. The iron electrode works best if it surrounds the object to be cleaned, since the cleaning is line-of-sight to a certain extent. The iron electrode will be eaten away with time. Stainless steel has the advantage (some alloys, but not all) that it is not eaten away. Q. How do I connect the battery charger? A. THE POLARITY IS CRUCIAL!! The iron or stainless electrode is connected to the positive (red) terminal. The object being cleaned, to the negative (black). Submerge the object, making sure you have good contact, which can be difficult with heavily rusted objects. Q. How do I know if it is working? A. Turn on the power. If your charger has a meter, be sure come current is flowing. Again, good electrical contact may be hard to make-it is essential. Fine bubbles will rise from the object. Q. How long do I leave it? A. The time depends on the size of the object and of the iron electrode, and on the amount of rust. You will have to test the object by trying to wipe off the rust. If it is not completely clean, try again. Typical cleaning time for moderately rusted objects is a few hours. With heavily rusted objects can be left over night. Q. How do I get the rust off after I remove the object? A. Rub the object under running water. A paper towel will help. For heavily rusted objects, a plastic pot scrubber can be used, carefully. Depending on the amount of original rust, you may have to re-treat. Q. My object is too big to fit. Can I clean part of it? A. Yes. You can clean one end and then the other. Lap marks should be minimal if the cleaning was thorough. Q. After I take it out, then what? A. The clean object will acquire surface rust very quickly, so wipe it dry and dry further in a warm oven or with a hair dryer. You may want to apply a light oil or a coat of wax to prevent further rusting. Q. Will the method remove pitting? A. No. It only operates on the rust in immediate contact with unrusted metal. What's gone is gone. Q. What will it look like when I am done? A. The surface of rusted metal is left black. Rusted pits are still pits. Shiny unrusted metal is untouched. Q. What about nickel plating, paint, japanning and the like? A. Sound plating will not be affected. Plating under which rust has penetrated will usually be lifted. The solution may soften some paints. Test with a drop of solution in an inconspicuous place. Remove wood handles if possible before treating. Q. How can I handle objects that are awkward to clean? A. There are lots of variants: suspending an electrode inside to clean a cavity in an object; using a sponge soaked in the electrolyte with a backing electrode to clean spots on large objects or things that shouldn't be submerged (like with lots of wood). Q. How can I dispose of the solution? A. The bath will last until it gets so disgusting that you decide it is time for a fresh one. There is nothing especially nasty about it -- it's mildly basic - so disposal is not a concern, except you may not want all the crud in your drains. Q. Can I use metal containers? A. This is highly risky. Galvanized metal can introduce zinc into the solution. If you have used lye, it will attack aluminum. You may have problems with electrical shorts, etc. Stick to plastic. Q. How can I clean odd shaped objects? A. Be ingenious. Plastic PVC pipe and eave troughs, wooden boxes with poly vapor barrier. Ted Kinsey Private replies: kinsey@uno.cc.geneseo.edu ------------------------------------------------------------ Mon Feb 05 20:31:01 1996 From: Bill Gustafson\nSubject: RE: Electrolytic Rust Removal A few weeks back I said that I would check out with a friend of mine his process for cleaning saws. Ted just happened to post his note ahead of my note but I have to take mild exception with a few things and add some facts of mine that are specific to the cleaning of the saws. 1. Baking soda will work just fine. It is safer than lye. 2. Cleaning is not line of sight if the object is suspended in the solution, all of the rust is transformed. As for my info on the saws: 1. Be very careful if you are trying to clean a saw with etching on it. If the rust is behind the etch the etch will fall off (or be removed). 2. A box 6 X 12 X 42 can be constructed of lexan or similar substance. Try a small company rather than buying the pieces at the hardware store, much cheaper. The glue for this stuff can be applied by running a bead up the inside and the plastic is melted and bonded. 3. With a box this size up to three saws at a time can be done. 3. The tested current is 2 amps, usually fo charger, not a 12 volt charger which is usually too large. 4. One lead, the positive lead, is connected to a stainless steel bolt. The other lead, the negative lead, is clipped onto the saw blade itself. If you have a small saw and want to hang it, connect the lead to a wire which will drop the blade into the tank. My friends setup has three clips on his negative lead which allows him to do up to three saws at a time. 5. After about 2-3 days the iron will have been transformed to a black sludge. 6. The saw is removed and scrubbed with a brass (BBQ) brush until clean. 7. A very mild heat is now used to dry the saw completely. You must seal the saw now or rust will develop almost as you watch it. 8. The saw is now waxed with butchers wax, polished and then Renaissance wax is applied as a final coat. Granted, this is for a saw that will not be used but that is Hank Allen's method of cleaning saws for his collection. He has cleaned well over 100 saws using this method and is very pleased with it. ------------------------------------- Name: Bill Gustafson E-mail: Bill Gustafson\ncontributed a few more: - Cold Saws A circular saw that runs at low speed, using a blade with \"flat\" teeth, i.e. no beveling to one side or the other like on a wood-cutting blade. Runs with a soluble oil being pumped over the blade, soaking the work that way. Very useful and fast. Good for cutting most anything and doing so *much* faster than a bandsaw/chopsaw arrangement. Unlike an abrasive saw, it will not clog or balk at nonferrous alloys such as aluminum. I use one for cutting alloy #4130 in a production set-up to make hex keys and it is quite accurate and time-efficient. - Wet Abrasive Cutoff Saw These use a small-ish \"blade\" (actually what is referred to as a \"rubber wheel\"), maybe 6in. in diameter with a *very* narrow kerf: mine uses a blade only .050in. or so thick. Rotational speed is around 5,000rpm and with coolant shot onto either side of the wheel, an instant fog is produced, so an enclosure is recommended. The advantages: it will cut *anything*, hard or soft makes no difference; the finish is superb: you can see your reflection in a piece of hardened shaft; the burrs left are minimal, making it ideal for cutting small or delicate parts (I'm told it's the method most used for cutting hypodermic tubing, etc.). Not cheap: figure $5,000 for a good one (and there are some bad ones out there: I've got one!) 33. What kind of oil should I use on my lathe/mill? This is certainly a frequently asked question! The first answer is to use whatever the manufacturer's manual suggests, presuming you have a manual for your machine. Feed-screw threads, half nuts, back gears and similar are usually lubricated with a heavy oil such as Vactra 2 or 3, or grease if protected from chips and swarf. Some suggest a mixture of oil and STP oil treatment. (South Bend recommends the same oil as used on the ways). Beds and \"ways\" are often treated with special oils, called \"way oils\". ISO 68 (medium weight). Examples: Exxon Febis K 68, Shell Tona T-68, Sun way lube 1180, Mobil Vactra No 2, Texaco Way lube 68, Gulf Gulfway 68, Chevron Vistac 68X. Spindle bearings call for \"spindle oil\" such as Exxon Nutto H32, Shell Tellus V32, BP HLP32, Castrol Hyspin AWS32, and Mobil DTE 32 (in this case the 32 is the ISO VG32 spec, about the same as SAE 10-weight, and is what Myford recommends for their lathes). ISO grade 22 is also used (it's what South Bend recommends, for example). All three types are available from the better supply outfits, such as MSC. Remember that the money you spend on proper oils will be a lot less than the cost of replacing the machine! That's a lot of names, but how do you choose? Probably the first thing to do is follow the manufacturer's recommendations, if you can find them. South Bend, for example, recommends four different lubricants for their 9\" and 10\" lathes: CE1671 bed way lube, CE1603 medium machine oil, CE-1600 light machine oil, and CE1625 teflon grease. These are available from South Bend, and the discussion and tables below should allow you to choose an equivalent oil available from an industrial supply house. Failing a manufacturer's recommendation, a key issue is typically the viscosity. There are a number of ways of describing viscosity, most of them confusing. We will now make a quick attempt to remove some of this confusion. Machinery's Handbook has a nice section that goes into the different kinds of oil performance for lubrication and how viscosity changes with temperature. But it's not really detailed enough to make a practical choice. Most people are familiar with the SAE viscosity scale, because most people have bought oil for their cars. What isn't immediately apparent is that there are two SAE scales, both in common use: one for crankcase oils, and one for gear oils! There is an ISO scale (VG numbers) and there is the Saybolt scale. Let's start with the Saybolt scale, which is measured with something called the \"Saybolt Universal Viscometer\": In said viscometer, the oil flows through a tube 0.1765 cm in diameter, 1.225 cm long, under an average head of 7.36 cm, from a vessel 2.975 cm diameter. The time in seconds required for 60 cc of oil to flow through the tube is the viscosity in seconds Saybolt. The specification is typically given at a particular temperature, such as 100 degF or 210 degF. (Something tells me that the numbers in the description above were originally English units, not metric.) With that description of Saybolt Universal Seconds (SUS) in mind, let's look at the SAE scales. First, for the crankcase scale: SAE SUS @ 100F SUS @ 210 F 5 92 38.5 10 165 44 20 340 54 30 550 64 40 850 77 50 1200 93 In addition, \"Mark's Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers\", Eighth Edition, lists the following for Crankcase Oils: SAE SUS @ 210 F 20 45 min - 58 max 30 58 min - 70 max 40 70 min - 85 max 50 85 min - 110 max But it goes on to show the following for gear and transmission oils: SAE SUS at 210 F 75 40 min 90 49 min 85 63 min 90 74 min - 120 max 140 120 min - 200 max 350 200 min So you can see that the viscosity at 210 F for SAE 80W gear oil is about the same as SAE 20W crankcase oil. Finally, there's the ISO VG scale. From perusing a number of Mobil oil data sheets, it appears that the ISO VG value of an oil is exactly its viscosity in centiStokes at 40 degC. Unfortunately, the relationship between cSt at 40 deg C and SUS at 100 degF is not a linear one. But you can find a fairly complete table of tradeoffs at http://www.bconnex.net/~noco/nocovisc.htm. Here's an abbreviated version that relates cSt and SUS @ 100 degF: cSt SUS at 100 degrees F 10 58.91 15 77.39 20 97.77 25 119.3 30 141.3 35 163.7 40 186.3 45 209.1 50 232.1 55 255.2 60 278.3 65 301.4 70 324.4 75 347.6 80 370.8 85 393.9 90 417.1 95 440.3 100 463.5 (Taken from ASTM Table 1, D2161-63T) Also, SUS at any temperature is SUS at 100F multiplied by 1 + (t-100)0.000064 ie 58.91 SUS at 100F is 58.91x(1.007)= 59.32 at 212 F To pull this all together, let's look at some specific examples. Above, we mentioned the South Bend recommended oils. Not only does SBL give part numbers, but they give viscosities in SUS at 100 degF: Usage SBL p/n SUS @ 100 F ISO VG SAE (crankcase) light spindle CE1600 100 21 5 medium machine CE1602 150-240 30-55 10-20 way lube CE1603 250-500 57-100 20-30 Thus, a good substitute for SBL CE1600 would be Mobil Velocite No. 10, which is an ISO VG 22 spindle oil. Mobil Vactra No. 2, ISO VG 68, is probably a good substitute for SBL CE1603 - it matches the viscosity and is formulated as a way lube (has appropriate coolant separability and corrosion resistance). Now, multigrade motor lubricants are not recommended as machine oils. This is for two reasons: 1. Motor oils have additive packages that are designed to avoid corrosion and condensation problems that are unique to the heat cycle and high-temp operation of an engine, problems that are not found in machine tools. 2. Modern motor oils have detergents that keep the contaminants in suspension (so they can be removed by the oil filter) - most machine tools do not have a filter system, so the contaminants will be circulated around to the bearing surfaces rather than falling out of suspension to the bottom of the gear case. That being said, there are several people on the list who are very happy using Mobil 1 motor oil as spindle and countershaft lubricants. The 5W-30 oil is approximately the right viscosity for spindle bearings, and the 15W-50 is heavy enough for countershafts and gearboxes. (Remember that Mobil 1 is a detergent oil, and it has been recommended that it should be changed a couple of times a year to flush suspended particles). The final choice is up to you, of course. Machine oils have their own special additive packages geared towards the requirements of machining. Now that you've made a decision about what oil to use, how do you oil it? Most lubrication charts assume production use, and give oiling intervals accordingly. I prefer to spend five minutes oiling the machine every time I use it, just to make sure everything is wet and topped off. A suggestion I've read is to oil lathe ways before using, to clean off dust/grunge that may have accumulated since you last used it. After work is finished, wipe off but leave a film for rust prevention. Elsewhere we mentioned the book \"A Brief treatise on Oiling Machine Tools\" (Guy Lautard) but nobody's posted a review yet. I has also been suggested that the FAQ from rec.motorcycles can shed more light on the subject. 34. What are the various tapers (Morse, JT, R8, etc.)? Unfortunately, there are many different tapers, and not enough space to tabulate them here. For details, consult a good reference such as Machinery's Handbook, or Machinists' Ready Reference. There is also a nice table of tapers at http://www.loganact.com/tips/tapers.htm First, why use tapers? Two basic reasons. At shallow angles, a tapered rod will tend to stick in a matching socket. This is frequently used to hold tools such as drills or centers in a lathe tailstock, allowing rapid change. At steep or shallow angles, a taper allows mating parts to line up very accurately. Note that the shallow tapers such as Morse may tend to get stuck if too much force is used, and this can turn into an interesting problem when you try to separate them! Tapers are poor holders for large side-loads, in which case you need a drawbolt or drawbar. Here, a threaded bar is used to pull (draw) the tool into the socket and hold it in place. This is commonly used in milling machines and for collets. Shallow tapers such as Morse are \"grabby\" and need some force to break free. Beyond a certain angle, a taper is self-releasing if the coefficient of friction is less than the tangent of the taper angle. Tapers can be sensitive to chips and dirt, so keep them clean. A gouged taper socket can usually be cleaned up nicely with a taper reamer, if you can borrow one. Morse: Very common in lathe spindles and tailstocks. Different standard sizes exist, such as MT1, MT2, and so on. The actual taper varies from one size to the next. MT0 small=.2520 inch, large=.3561 inch, taper=.62460 in/ft MT1 small=.3690 inch, large=.4750 inch, taper=.59858 in/ft MT2 small=.5720 inch, large=.7000 inch, taper=.59941 in/ft MT3 small=.7780 inch, large=.9380 inch, taper=.60235 in/ft MT4 small=1.020 inch, large=1.231 inch, taper=.62326 in/ft 4 1/2 small=1.266 inch, large=1.500 inch, taper=.62400 in/ft MT5 small=1.475 inch, large=1.748 inch, taper=.63151 in/ft MT6 small=2.116 inch, large=2.494 inch, taper=.62565 in/ft MT7 small=2.750 inch, large=3.270 inch, taper=.62400 in/ft These values are for the \"business\" part of the taper, and exclude whatever the taper is attached to, such as a drill or a center, and also excludes the tang, if any. Note that there is no overlap, making it practically impossible to mate mis-matched tapers (this may also explain the different taper rates). Some MT accessories such as drills will have a flat tang on the end, intended to mate with a matching slot in the socket, to give a setup better strength against rotation; in this case the taper is primarily being used for alignment, and to hold the drill from falling out when not being used. Most small home-sized lathes use between MT0 (e.g. the Sherline) and MT4. Larger taper sockets may include a sideways slot, intended for a flat tapered knock-out bar to facilitate tool removal. Machinery's Handbook claims that Morse tapers are the only type of taper used on drills that have a taper shank. Morse Stub: a variation of Morse, but less than half as long. Same numbers as Morse, and correspond to the large end; that is, you can make a Morse Stub #3 by slicing off the end of a standard Morse #3 (excluding the problem of making the tang, if any). Brown & Sharpe tapers are similar to Morse tapers, but are found on some end mills and reamers, and on milling machines and grinding machines, also dividing heads. Sometimes they have a tang, sometimes they are drilled and tapped for a draw-bolt. Some examples: BS1 small=.20000 inch, large=.23922 inch, taper=.50200 in/ft BS2 small=.25000 inch, large=.29968 inch, taper=.50200 in/ft BS3 small=.31250 inch, large=.37525 inch, taper=.50200 in/ft BS4 small=.3500 inch, large=.4023 inch, taper=.50240 in/ft BS5-BS18 see references. Taper varies with number. Jarno: Used on various machines, such as profiling machines and die-sinking machines, and on some lathes. An attempt to create a very simple taper: all of them are .6 inch of taper per foot, the diameter at the large end is as many eighths, the diameter at the small end is as many tenths, and the length as many half-inches as the number of the taper (i.e. machinists making tapers didn't have to use big formulae or tables). Some examples: 2 small=.2, large=.25 3 small=.3, large=.375 4-20 see references, or compute from formulae above. Jacobs Taper: commonly used to mount a drill chuck to a machine, whether a drill press or a lathe tailstock. Since most chucks use a female Jacobs, such as JT6, and most tailstocks are female Morse, an adapter bar is usually used here, with the appropriate tapers on each end. The taper varies quite a bit with taper number. 0 small=.22844, large=.2500, taper=.59145 inch per foot 1 small=.33341, large=.3840, taper=.92508 inch per foot 2 small=.48764, large=.5590, taper=.97861 inch per foot 2S small=.48764, large=.5488, taper=.97861 inch per foot 3 small=.74610, large=.8110, taper=.63898 inch per foot 4 small=1.0372, large=1.1240, taper=.62886 inch per foot 5 small=1.3161, large=1.4130, taper=.62010 inch per foot 6 small=.6241, large=.6760, taper=.62292 inch per foot 33 small=.5605, large=.6240, taper=.76194 inch per foot Numbers 0-5 appear to have been original, in that number 6 and number 33 are smaller than 5, and have a length of exactly 1 inch, and thus seem like later additions to the series. Note some Jacobs chucks also have a threaded tang; see Machinery's Handbook for details. R8: Frequently used on milling machine spindles. Lots of tooling is available for R8. Requires the use of a drawbar as the angle is relatively \"blunt\" and usage is often vertical with large side loads. The taper is apparently 16 degrees 51 minutes, and the relevant diameters are .949 and 1.25 inches. The drawbar thread is 7/16-20 Others: American National Standard Tapers: really several families. The \"self-holding\" series appears largely identical to Morse except for details of the tang dimensions: ANS continues the taper all the way down the sides of the tang, while Morse ends the taper at the start of the tang, with a straight-sided tang that starts out a bit smaller than where the taper left off. Some very small tapers are based on Brown & Sharp (they have fractional numbers), and some large ones use a taper of .75 inch per foot (numbers 200-1200). They also have a separate family of steep tapers, numbered 5-30 in steps of 5, apparently meant for milling machine spindles and such. British Standard Tapers: mentioned in Machinery's Handbook but not really explained. Sorry. 35. What is Electric Discharge Machining (EDM)? EDM is a method for producing holes and slots, or other shapes, by using an electric discharge (spark) to remove unwanted material. It is also called spark erosion. Sometimes it is used to produce a part, such as producing a slot in a very hard metal, and sometimes it is used to \"rescue\" a part such as removing a broken tap. The basic idea is to move an electrode very close to the work piece, and repeatedly produce a spark between the two. This is best done while immersed in a dielectric liquid rather than in air, and it helps if the proper distance can be automatically maintained. Note that the electrode gets eaten as well as the workpiece, and some compensation must be made for this. Very good finish can be achieved, though at reduced speed. EDM is not a fast method; some jobs can take days to produce holes, so its use is limited to jobs that cannot easily be done in other ways (e.g. oblong slots or complex shapes, sometimes in very hard material). Note too the work must be conductive so it does not work on materials such as glass or ceramic, or most plastics. A good overview is in the Metals Handbook published by the American Society for Metals (ASM), volume 3, \"Machining\" (page 227 of the 8th edition, 1967). A wire EDM machine uses a wire (usually brass) as the electrode, which passes between guides like a bandsaw blade. The wire may be used only once. As it runs from a spool through the job, it is eroded and reduced in diameter by as much as 1/3. The old immersion system has now been largely replaced by flushing nozzles which surround the upper and lower wire guides. These blast the dielectric through the cut. This system works well, and has the tremendous advantage of being quick to shut off to remove parts, rethread broken wire, etc. As to the functionality of the wire EDM system, just imagine what you can do with a wire that leaves a .010\" kerf through 6\" thick stainless steel without heating it up. With the CNC control a taper can be imparted to the workpiece, because even the low-end machines have independently controlled upper and lower guide movement. High-end machines are mostly a way of getting more power (and therefore faster operation); more capacity; and convenience features, like automatic wire threading and a sinker-EDM head to create internal starting holes in hard material. EDM is well-suited for automated control. In fact, it seems almost the only way to go, which usually puts sophisticated EDM out of the reach of most home shop machinists. Luckily, the fundamentals are simple enough you can get by without computer control at the expense of constantly adjusting the gap manually, as is the case in the Popular Science article. An easily-built system is described in Popular Science, March 1968, pages 149-153. However, it is electrically dangerous from a shock standpoint, and suggests using kerosene as the dielectric which is a strong fire hazard. This machine was reworked a bit in the January 1991 issue of Home Shop Machinist (HSM), with a few notes in March 1991 (page 11), July 1991 (pages 4-6), May 1992 (pages 10-11), May 1994 (page 44), and May 1995 (page 19). EDM was described in February 1993 in Electronics Now (pages 79-81) along with a list of EDM resources, with a followup in the May 1993 issue (pages 78-80) that references the Popular Science and HSM articles. This machine requires \"manual\" feed of the electrode. Please note that non-flammable dielectrics should be used, and are available from supply companies such as MSC (I have also heard of using de-ionized water as the dielectric). A more complex system was described in the July 16 and August 6 1976 issues of Model Engineer magazine (with a letter in the November 5 1976 issue, and a followup in the October 2 1981 issue). In this case a small stepping motor is used to automatically feed the electrode. This is a great improvement, but complicates building the system unless one of your other hobbies is electronics. From August 1993 to April 1994, Strictly IC magazine published a serial on building another stepper-driven machine. Being newer, it may be easier to build because the parts listed are probably still available. But, again, electronics should be another hobby (or perhaps you have a friend who needs some machining done?). The series also suffers a bit from the author re-designing the system as the series was published, but who ever builds something as published, anyway? (There was also a letter on the project, in February 1995) In May 1995, HSM started a six-part (one year) series on another complex EDM system, inspired by the Model Engineer series but updated to use contemporary parts. Village Press will re-publish this series as \"Build an EDM\" which should be available in late 1997. See also http://www.pe.net/~brettj/edm/ and http://www.edm.com.

Solvent safety Doug White (gwhite@ll.mit.edu) posted this on 11/16/94 regarding safety of some common solvents: HEALTH HAZARDS OF COMMON CHEMICAL CLEANING SOLVENTS People in several different newsgroups I subscribe to use chemical solvents for various projects. A while back in rec.bicycles, there was a discussion of the health hazards of using these solvents. A friend of mine is in the laboratory safety business, and ran off copies of the 'Material Safety Data Sheets' (MSDS) for many of the common solvents. It's a bit tricky to cover everything, because some are known by several different names, and MSDS's from different sources don't list things in a consistent manner. I've attempted to consolidate this information into something that covers the critical differences between the solvents, and that is easy to understand for people like me who aren't safety experts or chemists. I've listed these (roughly) in decreasing order of 'nastiness'. It's difficult to do a precise ranking, because some solvents are greater risks depending on whether you touch it, breath it, drink it, or set it on fire. If there is anything you like to use that you don't see here, just call the manufacturer and ask for the MSDS on the product. They are required by law to send you one. There are several key things I would watch out for: 1) How flammable is it? Solvents are rated either highly flammable, flammable, combustible, or non-flammable, depending on the flashpoint. I believe anything with a flashpoint below 100F is considered at least flammable. 2) Check the Time Weighted Average exposure limit. This is usually listed in parts per million, or milligrams per cubic meter (mg/M*3). This will give a rough feel for how toxic the stuff is. 3) Look for specific problems. Can it be toxic if absorb through the skin? Is it just an eye irritant, or will contact cause damage? Because all of these solvents dissolve grease and oil, at a minimum, they will leach the oils out of your skin. With prolonged exposure, this can cause irritation and dermatitis. Your senses are a good warning system. If a mere whiff of something makes your eyes water and your head spin, it's probably not too good for you. Whatever you like to use, do so with adequate ventilation, gloves, eye protection, and away from any source of combustion. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Nitrobenzine: (AKA Essence of Mirbane, Mirbane oil) I've included this because it used to be used in some gun cleaning solvents. It was removed because of health risks. Nasty stuff. Very toxic by inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion Irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin Danger of cumulative effects, causes nervous system disorders Combustible, Flashpoint = 190F, 87C Readily absorbed through skin, do not breath vapor. Time Weighted Average exposure limit 1 part per million (5 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kerosene: (AKA Coal Oil, Range Oil) Easy to obtain. This was my father's favorite all-round solvent. Works well on bicycles chains. Toxic by inhalation or ingestion Irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin Attacks central nervous system Combustible, Flashpoint = 100F, 38C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 14 parts per million (100 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Lacquer Thinner: This is a mixture of a variety of chemicals, and will vary with manufacturer. Some of the components are pretty nasty, but information on the mixture is not very complete. The brand I have a data sheet on contains: Isopropanol, n Butyl Acetate, Methanol, Acetone, VM&P Naptha, Toluene, and Hexane. This is a particularly effective solvent, and works very well removing hardened grease and grime from old machine tools. Toxic by inhalation, minimal toxicity by ingestion Irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin Attacks central nervous system Flammable, Flashpoint = -10F, -23C The Worst component (Hexane) has a Time Weighted Average exposure limit of 50 parts per million, but it's percentage in the mixture is unknown ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Naptha: (AKA Lighter Fluid, Petroleum Ether) This is one of my favorite cleaning solvents, because it doesn't attack most plastics or paint. It's great for removing adhesive from tape and labels. Although it is listed as a skin irritant, it isn't toxic if you spill some on your hands. Toxic by inhalation or ingestion Irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin Attacks central nervous system Highly Flammable, Flashpoint = -57F, -49C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 100 parts per million (400 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Paint Thinner: (AKA Mineral Spirits, Petroleum Naptha) A common solvent, readily available at most hardware stores. It is considered non- irritating to eyes. Toxic by inhalation or ingestion Irritating to respiratory system, slightly irritating to skin Attacks central nervous system Combustible, Flashpoint = 111F, 44C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 100 parts per million (400 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Turpentine: (AKA Spirit or Oil of Turpentine) I never use this anymore, but it was THE standard paint brush cleaner before latex paints came out. Toxic by inhalation or ingestion Irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin Can penetrate skin to produce systemic effects. Can cause eye damage Prolonged exposure can cause allergenic sensitization. Combustible to Flammable, Flashpoint = 90-115F, 32-46C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 100 parts per million (560 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Acetone: (AKA Methyl Ketone, Propanone, Pyroacetic Ether) The one unique application I know of for acetone is that it dissolves cyanoacrylate glues (SuperGlue). It will attack many plastics. Toxic by inhalation or ingestion Irritating to respiratory system and skin Risk of serious damage to eyes Attacks liver and kidneys Flammable, Flashpoint = 1F, -17C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 200-1000 parts per million (470-2400 mg/M*3) (Varies substantially from country to country) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Denatured Alcohol: (Denatured Ethanol) This is ethyl alcohol with just enough 'denaturant' to make you violently ill if you try to make a cocktail out of it. Denaturants vary, but the most common one is a few percent methyl alcohol (methanol). I couldn't find a MSDS on the 'denatured' version, so the info below is from the ethanol MSDS. The only major difference should be in toxicity by ingestion, which is the whole point of the denaturant. Ethanol is a fairly mild solvent, and may require more patience and elbow grease than others. On the other hand, it's pretty safe. Water dissolves in it, so you can use it to dry off delicate items that have gotten wet, or have been washed in water first. Ethanol will cleanly remove even the most fossilized protective paper from acrylic plastic (Plexiglass), if you let it soak overnight in a plastic bag. Somewhat toxic by ingestion (mostly because of denaturant) Excessive exposure to vapors can cause eye and respiratory irritation Flammable, Flashpoint = 50-55F, 10-13C Time Weighted Average exposure limit 1000 parts per million (1900 mg/M*3) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Orange Oil: (AKA OptiClear & lots of other tradenames) This is listed as a 'food oil distillate'. It's a volatile liquid extracted from orange peels, and smells like oranges. The manufacture of 'OptiClear' recommends it as a replacement for 'toluene, xylene, or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as TCE' (Trichloroethylene). It is biodegradable. This is the only type of solvent that is listed as GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe). Not considered toxic Can cause skin irritation Combustible, Flashpoint = 140F, 60C No exposure limit Before everyone floods me with email asking where you can get this stuff, 'OptiClear' is an optical grade solvent used at the lab where I work. It's probably a bit more refined (and expensive) than what most people need. The price info I have is very old, but lists a case of four 1 gallon jugs for $86. It's manufactured by: National Diagnostics, Inc. 1013-1017 Kennedy Blvd. Manville, NJ 08835 (201) 722-8600 I have seen ads for other brands of orange based solvents, but haven't ever bought any. My local hardware stores don't seem to carry it. If someone has a good source, I'd love to hear about it. 37. What does \"gage\" (or \"gauge\") mean? Webster's seems to prefer \"gauge\", but Machinery's Ready Reference uses \"gage\" for sheet, and \"gauge\" for wire. Strictly speaking, \"gauge\" is a measuring device, and \"gage\" a measurement system, but common usage has corrupted the distinction. An arbitrary assignment of numbers to size, used on sheet, wire, and many other things (tubing, shotgun bore, needles, and so on). Unfortunately there are so many different standards that using gage to specify a material is almost useless, and perhaps even dangerous. If in doubt, use decimals. For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as approximately .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original standard was based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel has almost entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds per cubic inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no formula for converting gage to thickness or weight. Wire might be specified in American or Browne & Sharpe, Birmingham or Stubs, Washburn & Moen, Trenton Iron Co., Stubs' Steel, Imperial Wire gage, music wire gauge, or others. In the US, I've commonly seen electrical wire in AWG (American Wire Gauge); even-numbered values are much more common than odd ones. As an example, 12-gauge wire is .081\" (AWG), .109\" (Birmingham or Stubs), .105\" (Washburn & Moen), .028\" (music wire gauge). In most cases a larger gauge means smaller wire, except music wire goes the other way around! If you need specific values for specific gages, many are listed in various references such as Machinery's Handbook. On September 20, 1994, Rowland Carson posted a nice list of most of the gauge systems in use worldwide: Alhoff & Muller Music Wire Gauge music wire American Screw & Wire Co Music Wire Gauge music wire, spring wire American Zinc Gauge zinc sheet ASA B32.1 uncoated thin flat metals USA Birmingham Gauge BG iron hoop & strip, steel sheet Birmingham Wire Gauge BWG iron & steel telephone wire Birmingham Wire Gauge for Silver & Gold silver & gold Brown & Sharpe Wire Gauge B & S non-ferrous sheet & strip Brunton Music Wire Gauge music wire Card Wire Gauge CWG fibre yarns Continental Zinc Gauge sheet & strip English Music Wire Gauge music wire English Zinc Wire Gauge zinc sheet Felten & Guilleame Music Wire Gauge music wire German Sheet Gauge sheet metal Instrument Wire Gauge instrument wire ISO Metric Preferred Series (R388) all applications Junge de Paris copper wires Lancashire Pinion Wire Gauge LPG cast steel drill rods Mathieson & Hegeler Gauge M & H zinc sheet Millimetre Wire Gauge steel wire National Wire Gauge NWG steel wire Poehlimann Music Wire Gauge music wire Printers Wire Gauge printers wire Roebling Wire Gauge steel wire Sewing & Darning Needle Series sewing & darning needles Standard Wire Gauge SWG wire & strip, tube thickness Stitching Wire Gauge Stubs Iron WIre Gauge iron wire Stubs Steel Wire Gauge steel drill rod Tinplate finished tinplate Twist Drill & Steel Wire Gauge drill rod US Galvanised Sheet Gauge GSG galvanised sheet US Manufacturers' Standard Gauge MSG iron & steel sheets & plates US Standard Gauge USG stainless steel US Steel Wire Gauge USSWG steel wire Washburn & Moen Gauge WG steel wire Warrington Wire Gauge steel wire Yorkshire Wire Gauge steel wire 38. Leveling a lathe Most people agree that a lathe should be properly leveled to get the best accuracy. This seems to be true of large lathes more than small ones even if they are extremely heavy. One method is to use a precision level, though Charlie Greenman (greenmana@delphi.com) pointed out the following method (late January 1995) which was also written up in August 1995's Projects In Metal by Steve Wellcome: ----- I'll talk about this one more time, as it's worth it and you can go truly crazy doing lathe alignment with a level unless it's a new or totally unworn lathe bed AND the top of the inverted V's (which do not contact anything) are perfect. The saddle (on a V-bed lathe) does not touch the top of the V's (or it had better not). And it is the top of those V's that you are using to to align the bed. It is also the top of the V's on which things large and small fall. So if you have a new lathe bed then fine, spend $100 or so, spend a month making one, or borrow an alignment level and have at it. Or you can depend on simple geometry -- the fact that anything held in a chuck in the headstock HAS to revolve about the axis of the headstock spindle, and use that technique to align the lathe bed... A good setup level indicates .0005\"/foot and they are expensive. You can set up your lathe this way. This works I've done it. You have to put some means of adjusting the feet of the lathe bed that you can adjust. The last chapter of Tubal Cain's Workholding in the Lathe has a beautiful description of this. Get the lathe fairly level and somewhat tightened down. Get a good round rod that is very round and the same diameter end to end. A nontrashed car strut will work. Put the rod in the 3-jaw chuck. Get something like the Starrett last word and put it on it's magbase and the magbase on the compound. Rotate the rod in the 3-jaw and adjust the compound using the cross-slide such that the swing on the dial exactly straddles the 0. Say there is 6thou total runout at the chuck. You'd want 3thou on each side of the 0. Run the carriage down toward the tailstock and again rotate the bar. The actual runout you get is not important. What is important is that the reading on both sides of the 0 is the same. If there's 20 thou total runout, you'd want 10 thou on each side of the 0. If it is say -8 and plus 12 that means that the right front leg (tailstock end, nearest you) is high. Lower it a bit. Go back to the headstock and again set the dti so that it straddles the 0, move to the tailstock end of the bar and check it again. When you get it such that the magnitude straddles the 0 at the chuck end of the rod (the carriage as close to the headstock as you can get it) and it straddles the 0 at the tailstock end, you've aligned the lathe bed. Now, here's the pisser. You can see, quite literally, how much (if any) wear there is in the bed by checking the rod along the way. You will probably find that there is some wear up near the headstock. And you can see how much wear there is by seeing the difference in the straddle on the dti. If you have a .0001 dti, all the better. What is important on the rod is that it is round and smooth and the same diameter. It does not matter if it is straight as you know damned well that it's going to be swinging around the headstock axis no matter how bent! The only problem with a really bent rod is the runout might go beyond the range of your dti. You might want to read this a couple of times and think about it before doing it. :-) This is not originial with me (I'm not smart enough). It is, I believe, original with Arthur Gaucher, a retired tool and die maker who has forgotten more about this stuff than I shall ever know. ... I had a pretty whacked Logan lathe bed and this technique told me how whacked it was and where. You can jack up the right front leg (the near side of the tailstock end) to compensate for one hell of a lot of bed wear but unhappily the tailstock will no longer be anywhere near aligned with the headstock! So it won't really fix anything, but it will tell you the truth about your lathe bed. And itt will allow you to 'average' the error such that you minimize the problem of a *little* bed wear without throwing the tailstock out by much. 39. Wind Chimes From time to time people ask how to make wind chimes, especially how to calculate the lengths of the tubes/rods. There is no precise answer to this question! Let's discuss it. There was an article in Projects In Metal, December 1991, \"Eight-tube Wind Chimes\" by Thomas F. Howard. This is probably also reprinted in one of the \"Metalworking\" books by Village Press that condense issues of the magazine. I'll refer to this article in a few places simply as \"Howard\". First, there are lots of aspects of making one, other than how long to cut the chimes. How many chimes? What kind of chord do you want (major, minor, pentatonic, etc.). How should you arrange them? How big should the clapper be? First we'll discuss the chimes themselves, and address material and length. Different materials react in different ways. The tone will depend on the material (steel, aluminum, brass, the exact alloy, heat treatment and so on), whether you are using a solid cylinder or a tube, and if a tube, the wall thickness. It may also depend on the hanging method, and the tone quality will depend on how you strike a tube (with a hard object or a soft one, for example). Howard suggests hardwoods. Note that with a whistle, such as an organ pipe, the pitch is determined primarily by the length of the air column. It is the air that vibrates. The pipe material helps determine the \"timbre\" or \"voice\" of the pipe, but the air column determines the pitch. In a wind chime, the pipe itself is being struck and the air column has little to do with things (especially if the pipe is a solid cylinder!). Generally you will need to cut by trial and error, using a piano or some other reference if you want to get close. You can also do it by ear if you're either good or tolerant. But we can help you get close. If a chime is cut in half, the new tone will be *four* times the frequency, or two octaves up in pitch. To progress from one standard musical note to the next, each note is different in frequency by the twelfth root of 2, or about 1.059463. For chimes, we need the square root of this number, which is about 1.0293. In other words, if our \"reference\" chime is 1 foot long, the next lower note in the equal-tempered scale would be 1.0293 feet or 1 foot and .3516 inches or close to 1 foot, 23/64 inches. Many people can detect notes out of tune (relative to another) by a few percent of one note. So, cutting the chimes to proper length is important. One formula was presented in a book, \"Music, Physics and Engineering\" by Olsen, for a tube, free at both ends: f=1.133 pi K v / (l^2) K=sqrt(a^2 + ai^2) / 2 {radius of gyration of a hollow circular cylinder} Here pi=3.14159..., f is frequency (in Hz), l is length (in cm) and v is the velocity of sound in the material of the tube wall (eg Aluminium is 5.1E5 cm/s). Note that K is different for different cross-sections (I think it is K=a/2 for a solid circular bar). a and ai are the outer and inner radius of the tube (in cm). See also \"Basic Acoustics\" by Donald E. Hall, Harper & Row, NY, 1987. This book points out that for two bars being identical except in their lengths, their frequencies are related as: f2 / f1 = (L1 / L2)^2 There are several different musical scales to choose from. In the Western world, scales revolve around 12 equally spaced tones (equal tempered) but most music uses only 8 of the twelve. Which 8? This determines whether the scale is \"major\" or \"minor\" (or one of several less common scales). Another scale for wind chimes is the pentatonic scale (5 tones) used by eastern music. The advantage here is that no combination of pentatonic notes is considered dissonant (displeasing). Construction details: The chimes and clapper should be spaced so the clapper will hit either one chime, or two chimes, and no more. The order of the chimes is important for two reasons: It helps keep the weights distributed so the whole thing does not tilt, and it ensures that any pair of chimes will sound nice when struck together. OK, so much for the theory. Let's take a look at suggested lengths, courtesy of Howard: 16 7/8, 17 3/8, 18 7/16, 19 1/2, 20 3/4, 21 3/8, 22 3/4, 224 1/8. Eight chimes. Viewed from the top, he shows a hanging order starting at the 12:00 position of chime 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, and 8. For 1/2\" OD tubing with a 2-inch clapper, the chimes are placed on a 4.5-inch diameter. These lengths are close to theory for a major chord, but rounded to the nearest 16th. 16 5/8, 17 5/8, 19 1/4, 20 7/16, 21 5/8, 23 3/4. This is a six-chimer, hung with the same spacing as the one above but leaving two gaps: (blank), 1, 4, 2, (blank), 5, 3, and 6. Another consideration is how/where to hang each chime. It has been reported that hanging them .2242xlength from the end works well because this is a node point of the fundamental frequency (in other words, it wiggles less there!). If you hang them using nylon fishing line be certain to deburr the hole and smooth it, and don't place anything valuable under it (like a glass table)!. Also note the actual distance varies for each chime. On the topic of materials, soft metals such as copper will generate \"soft\" tones, like hitting a bottle with a rubber mallet. Hard metals like steels or certain aluminum alloys giver a sharper tone, like hitting a bottle with a ball peen hammer (not including breakage). Sharper tones seem to be common on very small chimes (a few inches to maybe 6 inches) which also seem to use solid rods. Softer tones are common on large ones (a foot or more). Also, larger OD is supposed to yield softer tones and longer-lasting tones. Cutting the chimes requires some thought, especially if you make a few hundred. Some suggest a chop saw with an abrasive blade, to get a better finish than you'd achieve with a toothed blade. Remember that aluminum dust is flammable and burns very hot, so don't let it accumulate. Use a blade that is compatible with what you're cutting. Some people like to use electrical conduit for the chimes. Other suggest seamless \"chro-mo\" 4130 bicycle frame tubing, while copper water pipe also seems useful. Possibly plugging one end or both will alter the sound but I'm not sure how at this point. Update, 10/9/97. An article was posted by Samuel V. Lockwood (lococnc@pacifier.com) with information he has derived for wind chimes: I promised I would post this a few months ago if /when I found my notes. These are tube lengths for a set of chimes, being in the key of C harmonic minor. This has a very serious, deep and melancholy sound. It has eight tubes so the main support will require sixteen holes to hang them from. The tubes are of aluminum .750 OD with .050 wall. They were mounted using 30 lb fishing line thru a hole thru both walls, appx .500 from the end. The striker was made of plexiglass and must have large enough dia to easily strike the tubes when it is moved by the \"wind catcher\" but should not touch in still air. 1 ROOT 11.466 (c) 2 2ND 10.895 (d) 3 3RDMIN 10.558 (d#) 4 4TH 9.817 (f) (inches) 5 5TH 9.28 (g) 6 5THAUG 9.114 (g#) 7 7TH 8.287 (b) 8 1ST OCT 8.012 (c) I also have notes on another set 6 tube that is C 6/9 tuned, but these notes are sketchy so I will double check before I post. This will be sometime after my next visit to my In/Laws house, likely around Thanksgiving day. This tuning has a very bright happy sound, reminds one of a sunny summer day. Being a machinist by trade and a musician by hobby I would appreciate hearing from any one who is actually tuning their chimes to notes and scales and their success and failures in this pursuit.

Patinas \"Patina\" -- \"A surface appearance of something grown beautiful esp. with age or use.\" Usually used in reference to copper, but also applicable to bronze, steel, and other materials. This is a very broad topic that depends greatly on the material being treated, purity of the treatment, environment, and eye of the beholder. There must be hundreds or thousands of ways to do this, and some of them may be old wives' tales. I have no way to verify these! For the most part these are quotes from postings. For the most part it seems to rely on ammonia or other nitrogen compounds. Note that ammonia can cause brass to stress fracture (e.g. don't clean firearm cartridges with it!). Cleaning the work is often stressed, and you can't usually get the patina quickly. It takes time to simulate age! \"It is common practice to treat copper roofs with ammonium sulphate to form the green color quickly; it is not exactly an oxide, and simple weathering sometimes does not do the trick.\" (From: John Whitmore, whit@carson.u.washington.edu). \"Unless you want to waste a lot of time experimenting and then still possibly not get a coating that will stay green, use a commercial patina made for that purpose. We use it in stained glass work. I'm sure it is available from anywhere that sells sculpture or architectural supplies.\" (From: John De Armond, jgd@dixie.com). \"Currently I patinate the brass with \"Verde-It\" (a chloride acid) and a blacking acid (selenium-based). Can anyone recommend other surface treatments? I also shine with anti-oxidants \"Nevr-Dull\" and \"Peek\". How long will these last? Can I do better? (I got tired of lacquering wires...)\" (From: Matt Brand, brand@b.ils.nwu.edu) [Electroplating a patina] \"...the method consists of treating the copper anodically in a solution of: magnesium sulphate 10 percent magnesium hydroxide 2 percent potassium bromate 2 percent Solution is held at about 95 degrees C, current density of about 0.04 A/(dm squared) for fifteen minutes. Initially deposit is CuS04.Cu(OH)2, but increases in basicity on exposure until the composition of the patina is reached. This is from H. Silman, et. al., Protective and Decorative Coatings for Metals, Finishing Publications...\" (From: Rob Pauley, rob.pauley@gtri.gatech.edu). \"Here are a couple of green patinas to try: 1 Tbsp ammonium chloride (Sal ammoniac) 1 Tbsp salt 1 oz ammonia 1 qt. bottled or distilled water Mix all in a plastic container that will be only for the patina mix and not used for other things. Warm or hot water will help the solids dissolve better. Spray the patina on the clean oil free copper and let set for 2 or 3 hours to dry then repeat 3 or so more times until you get what you want. You can also soak sawdust with the patina and pack it around the copper piece and seal it in a plastic bag for a day or 3. I have never used this patina but I have seen it and it can be very nice and smooth. I have used the following patina a lot. In a glass container mix up some nitric acid with water (1 part acid (reagent 75% pure) to 2 parts water). Always add the acid to the water slowly. Add to that mix some scraps of copper to dissolve in the acid until the acid no longer dissolves the copper. Do this outside where no body will get into it because it makes a deadly nitrous gas (not nitrous oxide). The solution will be a very dark blue. You have just made cupric nitrate. You can use a brush to apply the patina. Using a torch to accelerate the drying can work well but be careful not to over heat because it will turn black and crusty. The fumes are not good to breathe. This patina can also be used like the first patina. All patinas can, after they have set a few days, be waxed with paste wax (car wax). I have a copper bowl with the second patina on it that was waxed 3 years ago and it still looks good.\" (From: marck3@aol.com) \"You can get cupric nitrate at chemical supply houses. It works vary fast. I got a nice effect by dissolving about 2 tablespoons of the cupric nitrate crystals in a plastic spray bottle (with about 1 quart water). This was one of those sprayers that \"Fantastic\" cleaner comes in. Pre-heating the copper alters the mottling and texture too. Experiment on copper scraps with different strengths of solution and amount of patina solution applied.\" (From: Daniel Wold, danw@panix.com) \"To colour Copper or Brass Green: Cupric nitrate Cu(NO3)2 40 grams Ammonium chloride NH4CL 40 grams Calcium chloride CaCl2, 2H2O 40 grams Add distilled water to make 1 litre.

Just brush (or preferably spray) it on & allow to air dry. Repeat as necessary to achieve the desired results.

It is still common practice for the roofing crew to all pee in a communal bucket and pour it over the roof at the end of each day to force a patina.\" (From: Gary Hubert, gary.hubert@canrem.com) \"Well, one thing that works well for me is dormant spray, the lime/sulfur kind. You can get it at your gardening supply store. Produces some really colorful patinas depending on strength of solution and how long you dip the metal.\" (From: coppers@teleport.com) \"Personally I use a solution of lime/sulfur dormant spray (very weak) and let it sit for up to three months in solution. Or if your area has hard water (lots of minerals) just drop it in the toilet tank and let it sit until it looks good (this is a technique used by antiquities forgers). A good solid patina takes time.\" (From: Carl Mork, carl.mork@nwcs.org) \"NOTE: no patina is truly \"tough\". None of them can resist scratching. All you can expect is that light surface contact won't 'knock' bits off. You should plan to treat any patina with lacquer or plain wood wax. Three methods come to mind: Get a plastic or glass sealable container. Put your copper in it and cover it with a layer of salt. Put an open container of ammonia in there. Seal the whole thing up, come back several hours later. This gives a blue-green surface. Make up a solution of 2 cups water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon ammonium chloride. Put it in a spray bottle. Heat copper to over the boiling point of water. Lightly spray the surface. The water should immediately \"sizzle\" off. The color will take 5-15 minutes to develop. May be repeated. This gives a more green than blue color. Get a container, fill with sawdust. Saturate the sawdust with ammonia. Add lots of salt, mix well. Bury your copper in it. Come back in an hour. This gives a very nice speckly blue&green surface. You can control the speckle by how well it's all mixed together and how fine the sawdust is.\" (From: Mike Schechter Mike_Schechter@isr.syr.edu) \"From - 'Creative Gold and Silversmithing' by Sharr Choate Colouring Copper Green \"A patina is produced on the metal by brushing the surface with a solution consisting of 1 gram each of copper nitrate, ammonia chloride, calcium chloride, and 1 ounce of water.

There are several books on the subject; \"The Art of Patinas\" and \"The Coloring, Bronzing and Patinization of Metals\" [see reference section, below] are two that come to mind. These processes involve oxidizing or chemically reacting the surface of the metal to make it change color - usually, this also protects the metal from further reaction to the elements.

They have, at least, the book on Coloring, Bronzing and Patination.\" (From: douglas.wiggins@nwcs.org) \"Clean and degrease the metal and dunk it in liquid flours of sulfur.

Apply to object to be treated, with a camel's-hair pencil. Repeat the operation until the desired shade of green is reached.\nFirst off you may be wondering where to get these chemicals: Sodium chloride - This is table salt (NaCl) Ammonia water - This is what you buy when you buy liquid ammonia cleaner (get the stuff without any other cleaning agents added). Ammonium chloride - This is a little tougher. This is sometimes used in things like solder flux. However, it is also found in many of those kids chemistry sets. Try a good hobby shop - they often carry replacement chemicals for those sets (these are usually a little pricey for what you get, but you don't need much). Strong wine vinegar - Well, you can by wine vinegar from the grocery store (this is maybe 7% acetic acid). However, since acetic acid is the chemical we're looking for, and it's also used in photo fixing, you can find acetic acid in 28% and glacial(100%) at a good photo shop. 28% is by far good enough. Henley's says to use a camels hair brush, I've used one of those small, triangular makeup sponges with success. Keep in mind that the patina (verdigris) will appear as the solution dries on the copper surface. Several applications will probably necessary to get the depth of color you want. Heating the copper helps also, but isn't necessary. Note! Don't soak the copper in the solution, it won't turn green and the acetic acid will eventually start to eat away the copper! Also, the copper should be CLEAN when you do this.

Rand has kindly allowed me to include the information here, with the following notice: Copyright 1994 Rand Esser. May be reproduced without permission by not for profit groups for educational use only. The introduction included: Rand Esser, a Raleigh, North Carolina metalworker who specializes in lamps and furniture, demonstrated the application of various patinas on steel and brass. Rand uses chemicals to achieve different oxidized surfaces on metal, often layering patinas on top of each other to achieve unique and distinctive effects. The patinas are then sealed with hot wax. The article follows: PATINAS ON STEEL ---------------- By Rand Esser The patinas demonstrated at the March 12 meeting were copper sulfate solution, Black Topaz, and Rusty Red. I mix my own copper sulfate solution by mixing copper sulfate crystals with water, a little at a time, until the water will no longer dissolve the copper sulfate. Copper sulfate is available at Southern States stores. Black Topaz and Rusty Red are sold by Sur-Fin Chemical Corporation. Sur-Fin will send you a finish kit including seven six ounce bottles of their finishes for $50 (they also sell patinas for other metals). Larger sizes from one to fifty-gallons are available. These finishes result in a variety of effects depending on strength of the solution, reaction time, relative humidity, temperature, surface texture, and type of top coating. The Rusty Red and copper sulfate solution create similar effects. The Rusty red seems to be a bit more red and the copper sulfate is a bit more orange. I prefer the copper sulfate solution. It is more beautiful and less expensive than the Rusty Red. TIPS FOR PATINAS ON STEEL ------------------------- The surface to be finished must be completely clean. Remove all scale by sandblasting or wire brushing. Different surface textures will create different results. Sand blasted surfaces tend to be more dull and require a shorter reaction time. Wire brushed surfaces will be shinier, but require a longer reaction time. I sandblast first to remove the scale and then wire brush to create a shiny surface. Remove all grease, oil, and, dirt with mineral spirits. Surface must be white glove clean for best results. Different concentrations of the finish solutions give different results. Sur-Fin recommends diluting the Black Topaz 1:10 with water. I have used the Black Topaz at 1:5 with a very brown /black result. Different reaction times give different results. I usually leave the solutions on for just a few minutes. The Black Topaz ranges from a jet black with a short reaction time to bluish, greenish, black with longer reaction times to brown/black with very long reaction times. The Rusty Red and copper sulfate solutions range from a light copper plating effect to light rust to a dark crusty rust depending upon reaction time. Some interesting effects can be created by using two or more finishes on the same piece. The Rusty Red and copper sulfate solution will work on top of the Black Topaz finish. The Black Topaz does not seem to work on top of the others. I often begin with the Black Topaz and drizzle, drip, or brush a pattern on specific areas of the surface, leaving other areas bare. I then allow the Black Topaz solution to react until it is dry. Then I come back and coat the entire piece with the Black Topaz solution and quickly rinse the piece in water to stop the reaction. The areas treated first will have a different tone than the areas treated later. I then come back over the piece with the Rusty Red and/or copper sulfate solution and brush, drip, drop or drizzle it in specific areas to create coppery or rusty highlights. The entire piece is then thoroughly rinsed with water to stop the reaction. TOP COATING ----------- Once you have stopped the reaction by rinsing with water, allow the piece to air dry or speed up the process by heating it with a torch. At this point the piece is not very pretty. You will not know what the piece will ultimately look like until you apply a top coat. I usually heat the piece with a torch until it is barely hot and then apply wax with a lint free cloth. I have heard that linseed oil also works well. At this point the patina will reveal itself in its final state. By applying more wax and rubbing I can usually remove some of the more rusty spots revealing coppery areas. Additional coatings of wax will create a shinier finish with more depth. SAFETY ------ These chemicals are poisonous. They will irritate your skin and eyes. Wear rubber gloves, goggles, protective clothing, and a respirator. Read the labels on these products and dispose of properly. Keep them away from your kids. PERSISTENCE ----------- It takes time and experimentation to get good results with these chemicals. Your finishes are likely to look different from mine due to the many variables involved. I am continually experimenting with different finishes on metals, steel in particular. I would like to compile a data base of information on this subject to share with other metalworkers. If you have information that you would like to share please let me know.

The cleaning process must remove mineral oils, organic oils and greases as well as traces of chemicals on the surface. It must remove oxidation which might interfere with the metal coloration or plating adhesion and it should possible activate or roughen the metal surface to better receive the treatment. Cleaning may be accomplished using mechanical (abrasive), chemical (heating, solvents, pickling with acids) and electrolytic (electrocleaning, electrostripping) means. Examples of easily achieved clean surfaces include sandblasted ones and ones scrubbed well twice with rinsings using Fantastic. A pumice rub followed by scrubbing with dishwashing liquid and ammonia on a toothbrush does pretty well. Repeated scrubs with Fantastic work. Best of all is electrocleaning. A simple procedure is: 1.0 Anneal and pickle in suitable acid. 1.1 Rinse 3-5 times in running water. 1.2 Dip into simmering ammonia and detergent solution and scrub well. 1.3 Rinse well 5 - 10 times. NB: electrocleaning can be used after step 1.3. While steps 1.0-1.3 produce a quite clean surface by themselves if one is electrocleaning it is not a bad idea to pre-clean using steps 1.0-1.3 so as to make the electrocleaning solution last longer and lower it's work load in cleaning the metal surface. A much better and surer procedure is: 2.0 Remove oxides with pumice 2.1 Rinse well. 2.2 Electroclean for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes, object as cathode, then reverse the polarity for a few seconds. 2.3 Rinse 3- 5 times in running water. 2.4 Dip in 1:10 sulfuric acid to neutralize the electrocleaning solution and activate surface. (15 seconds or so). 2.5 Rinse 3 - 5 times in running water. After cleaning, the metal should be placed in running or circulating water (preferably distilled) to avoid oxidation until it is plated or coloured. One can of course plate or colour immediately after cleaning. In all cleaning methods the piece must either be wired to suspend it in the solution or held with tweezers. It must afterwards be very well rinsed to remove all traces of cleaning chemicals. Do not touch the surface once it is free of grease. Sand blasting may be substituted for steps 1.0 and 2.0 above, a sand blasted surface is clean but can be damaged easily as well as being matte in appearance. Sample Electrocleaning solution: Sodium carbonate 50 grams Current density: 1-3A/dm2 Trisodium phosphate 25 grams Polarity: 1 - 3 minutes Cathodic (of work) Sodium Hydroxide 25 grams 5 - 10 seconds Anodic Water 2000 ml Operating Temperature 60-70C PATINA ON STEEL: A method of patinating steel, copyright Lewton-Brain 1990 Warning: This procedure should be undertaken with appropriate precautions; goggles, gloves, protective clothing, adequate ventilation. As part of a large scale patination project in which I patinated a steel roof surface 24 by 48 feet on both sides I performed some 40 experiments to find out how to patinate the steel which was a requirement for structural reasons. In doing so I also experimented with paint, buying over $350.00 worth of spray paint, eventually finding one single color which for all intents and purposes is green patina. When placed in recesses and the high areas are rubbed off it is indistinguishable from a cupric nitrate patina. It is a car paint: GM 42, 1980 Chevrolet Medium Green. While this is ideal for smaller surfaces my paint experiments did not produce the surface effects I required on the large scale work. I reasoned that if I could plate the steel with copper and then convert the copper to patina in a fume not only would the job be easier but it would also be safer than dealing with solvents or corrosive patination techniques (such as a cupric nitrate patination) over large surface areas. I was dealing with 4 x 8 foot sheet steel to be equally patinated on both sides simultaneously. Other types of objects might be easier to deal with. 'Tents' of polyethylene plastic sheeting stapled to a framework of 'economy' studs were built. The construction of such a tent requires that it be sealed (draped onto the floor from the frame and then weighted down). The object inside is positioned on supports of some kind so that it is suspended off the floor in the air inside the tent. Then pans of household ammonia are placed underneath the object. The fumes attack copper or copper based alloy surfaces. Under normal conditions one can activate a copper containing surface with a dilute salt solution to speed up the procedure and obtain a blue patination but this proved too corrosive for dealing with steel. The final procedure chosen was as follows: 1) The steel was cleaned well. Sandblasting would be ideal but was impractical for the project. Solvents were also out for safety reasons on such large surfaces without good ventilation. We ended up using Fantastic cleaner. Two scrubbings with Fantastic on large sponges and good rinsings in between and after were adequate most of the time. The surfaces were then left damp with the rinse water. Only the edges were handled to avoid contamination of the cleaned surfaces. 2) A contact plating solution for copper plating was prepared (see below) and this was applied to the steel using paint rollers (goggles/gloves!). Brushes work also but the paint roller is a bit more gentle. Plating occurs instantly. Several passes may be made over the same area, without pressing hard, which can remove the delicate plating. The surface was then rinsed very well. If areas of the plating lifted grease residues were the cause and a further local Fantastic sponging and good rinsing sufficed to allow plating to take place. After final rinsing the steel (held by the edges) was taken to the tent. One moves fast to retain the surface moisture. 3) The steel was then placed in the tent and pans of ammonia enclosed under it. The tent was sealed. The centers of the thin sheet sagged causing pooling, therefore we built a wooden support with a single nail pointing upwards to support the sheet. More stable objects would not need support, though pooling may be factor to consider depending upon the surface relief. The time required to convert the copper plating was optimal at about 1-1 and a half hours. 4) The steel was removed and gently rinsed as scrubbing or hard spraying can remove the delicate patina surface. It will be a mixture of blues, greens and hints of brownish red where pooling has occurred and the surface dried. In my case I chose to re-introduce pink spatter marks to the surface by spattering droplets of the contact plating solution onto the patina surface where they instantly went pinkish-brown. The steel was then dried with fans and immediately sealed using clear automobile enamel paint. I then went back with stencils and gold spray paint to further modify the surface. The steps in the procedure are then: Clean, rinse,plate, rinse, fume, rinse, dry and seal. The conversion process The copper on the surface is attacked by ammonia liquid, not as much by the fume which has a different chemical composition than the liquid. The water dampened surface slowly takes in ammonia fumes where they are converted to ammonia liquid in solution so that they can attack the copper. The purpose of the pans of ammonia below the object is to provide a constant vapor pressure which replenishes the ammonia on the surface at a constant rate as it is used up in converting the copper to patina. This system therefore ensures better overall constant dilution control than beginning with ammonia on the surface. Control Factors: Resists: Resists may be used to prevent plating or to prevent the plating from being converted to patina by the fumes. Resists to plating may be a greasy material (litho-crayon, oil) or thinned rubber cement. Other resists require too much cleaning time and may need solvents for removal. Resists to patination may be a protective spray through stencils (Pam) or thinned rubber cement. Pattern control through resists is easy. Time: Time is a factor in all fumings. Experiment with various times on sample pieces to have a palette of process marks (colors, tones, effects) to choose from. Pooling: Where pooling occurs variations in color will result. Pooling can be encouraged and controlled by local application of greases before or during patination and by the position and shape of the object. Various liquid thicknesses cause surface variations. Sealers: Sealers will each have a characteristic effect on the surface. I recommend making a palette of various sealing options over a patinated surface. Examples of sealers include waxes, oils, lacquers, transparent acrylics, enamels, varnishes and so on. They often have a tendency to darken the colors on the surface. I prefer clear auto enamel or Spray-Lac number 1473 professional Finish Clear Dead Flat lacquer. It is available from Star Chemical based in Hinsdale Illinois, Deerfield Beach, Florida and Dallas Texas. It is an industrial quality spray and requires good ventilation. It is very unobtrusive on a surface. With any spray the surface chosen can be glossy, like paint (in which case why not use paint?) or shortly after spraying can be matted down with a cloth pad for better surface control. Other Chemicals: I mentioned dilute salt solutions earlier. Many chemicals will modify surfaces. (Remember never to mix bleach and ammonia). Experimentation and sample making will offer the user control choices. Suggestions for initial investigations include salt, vinegar, baking soda and local heating. There are a number of patination books available including one I sell on patinas for small studios. Contact Plating Solution Recipe All safety warnings apply. Always add Acid to Water!! Goggles/Gloves! 250 grams copper sulfate (CuSO4) Technical grade chemicals for this solution is fine. 42 cc sulfuric acid Distilled water to the 1000 ml level. Put about 800cc water into plastic or glass container after marking the 1000cc level on it. Add the copper sulfate and stir to dissolve. Slowly pour a thin stream of acid into the swirling water. Heat is evolved-be aware of this. Rinse the acid container with distilled water and top up the mixture with it to the 1000 ml level. This solution can also be used as an electroforming solution for growing copper. Remember, acids are dangerous. A dust mask is suggested around chemicals. Work cleanly. Copper salts are toxic and irritant and should be handled with care. Dispose of properly. BOOKS: Ron Young's books are very good for larger scale work. His Contemporary Patination makes up for the poor safety attitude in the Methods for Modern Sculptors book. The former is a working, useful studio guide to patination unlike the monumental Colouring, Bronzing and Patination of Metals put out in 1983 by Hughes and Rowe.

There are several solutions that have come up in the past. a. One way is Electric Discharge Machining, discussed elsewhere. If you have an EDM system, you're in luck. Alternatively try to find a machine shop in your area that has one and will do this sort of work. The basic idea is to spark erode away most of the tap (if small) or at least one part of it, so the rest can be removed by just picking out the remaining pieces. b. There are commercial tap removers that have fingers which slip between the flutes, so you can grip the tap and remove it. This may not work well on small taps, and you have to buy the remover. It may be possible to build one but it might not work as well. c. If the workpiece is non-ferrous (and has no other ferrous pieces attached or embedded), you can mix up a saturated solution of aluminum Sulfate at 120 degrees F, and soak the workpiece in it. This should dissolve the tap in a few hours (or a few days at room temperature). A plastic tray such as Tupperware is best. d. Another person suggested nitric acid, if the workpiece is aluminum. Test it on chips to be sure it won't eat the workpiece. If the hole is blind, you may need to force some circulation by pouring out the \"spent\" acid and re-immersing from time to time. Note this is dangerous, nitric acid is nasty stuff; this might be best done outdoors to avoid damage to tools from fumes. Also, due to variations in alloys, the method might not work at all. d. If size permits, grind out part of the tap with a Dremel tool or equivalent, with a suitable grinding bit. e. In some cases, you can try to simply drill out the tap. This will depend on how hard the tap is (mainly the core), and how good a drill you have. It may be difficult to get a good start if the break is irregular or slanted. You may end up breaking the drill. f. Throw away the work piece and start over. g. Of course the easiest solution is to not break the tap in the first place. Use proper technique, lubrication, etcetera. Keeping them sharp has been suggested; Darex makes a tap sharpener, though it may be expensive for the home shop machinist. 42. Machining plastic OK, this is a metalworking newsgroup, but the question does come up from time to time, and Jim Harvey did a good job of summarizing past messages and experience. Please contact Jim, jim@hre.com, if you have questions/comments. Also, it was recently (2/19/97) pointed out that Cadillac Plastics has a machining guide for plastics covering speeds feeds etc., phone (800) 521-4004. These instructions are appropriate for the following materials; Nylon 101 and other type 6/6 Nylons Monocast (r) and other type 6 nylons Nylatron (r) GS,GSM,NSB,and NSM Nylons Acetal Delrin Delrin AF (Tm dupont) Q200.5 (Crosslinked Polystyrene) Drilling: --------- More heat is generated in drilling than in any other machining operation, causing difficulties not usually associated with fabricating metals. Extra care must be taken to prevent problems such as gumming, melted surfaces, crazing, and cracks around the drill hole. A low helix angle (14 - 17 degrees) with polished flutes is the recommended tool for drilling industrial thermoplastics. This type of drill with a large flute area permits a free flow of chips and minimizes the chance of overheating and gumming. High speed twist drills with standard spiral flutes (30 deg helix) may also be used successfully. Chip ejection is an important consideration in drilling. If the chips are not removed from the flutes as quickly as possible, friction will develop and result in poor finish, dimensional changes and discoloration. Drill Design: Drills should be designed with the proper point angle and lip clearance (90 - 118 deg / 9 15 deg respectively) for heavy wall or thick sections. Angles of 115 - 130 should be used for thin sections or thin wall pieces. An asymmetrical cutting edge is desirable in both thin and heavy section work. Drill speed: The following chart lists the recommended speeds for drilling in plastics Drill size RPM #60 - 33 5000 #32 - 17 3000 #16 - 1 2500 1/16 5000 1/8 3000 3/16 2500 1/4 1700 5/16 1700 3/8 1300 7/16 1000 1/2 1000 A thru D 2500 E thru M 1700 N thru Z 1300 Feeds should be .004\" - .015\" per rev. for Nylon 101,NSB,GS,GSM,MC901, and Acetal although rake angles and helix angles will differ slightly Lip relief should be 9 - 16deg for the nylons (the higher numbers for larger diameter drills)and 10 - 25 degrees for Acetal Q200.5 Acrylic should feed .004\"-.010\" with a 15deg lip relief angle. Drilling Large Diameter holes in the lathe ------------------------------------------ A slow spiral (low helix angle) drill or a general purpose drill ground to a point angle of 118 deg, with a lip clearance angle of 9 - 15 deg. is recommended. In either case, the lip rake should be ground off (dubbed) and the web thinned. Spade drills have been used successfully in drilling large diameter holes in these materials. They seem to work best in increments of 1\" to enlarge the hole from pilot to finished size. In order to prevent excess stress in the thermoplastic material, a trueing cut is recommended on the OD of the material on the chucking end. Using standard chuck jaws that have been radiused to the contour of the OD, or a step collet for maximum contact on the holding surface. Chuck the rod as lightly as possible on the trued end, applying only enough pressure to the piece to prevent slippage. It is imperative that a sufficient supply of cutting fluid is directed to the drill tip as it is advanced into the part. Start with a pilot hole (maximum diameter 1/2\") at a speed of 600 - 1000 rpm using a positive feed of approximately .005\" per rev. If at all possible, do NOT feed by hand due to the tendency of the drill to grab causing stress cracks. If you must feed by hand, grind (dub) the cutting edge (rake angle) of the drill slightly to reduce this tendency. If the pilot hole must be drilled by hand, reduce the chisel edge of the drill by thinning the web. A secondary drilling at a speed of 400 -500 rpm is required to expand the hole to 1\" diameter. Finally, bore the ID to the desired diameter using a single point boring tool. Using the following information: Light cuts of 1/16\" to 1/8\" Light feeds of .003\" - .007\" per revolution Depending on the rigidity of the machine, cuts as heavy as 3/8\" and feeds of .015\" per revolution can be achieved. 0 - 5deg NEGATIVE rake is preferred to balance cutting pressures. Important! Sharp Tools with large clearances are IMPERATIVE! HSS tools can be used for very short runs ONLY if the edges are kept extremely sharp. For long runs, or production work, Diamond tipped or Tungsten carbide tools honed with a fine 400 - 600 grit diamond wheel are preferred. Carbide tools should ALWAYS be used in turning the following materials: Nylatron GS, GSM, NSB, NSM, and MC 901 at speeds greater than 600 fpm. Vertical Milling ---------------- Vertical milling , using face mills, end mills, shell mills, and fly cutters is the most common method of milling thermoplastics. Extremely high spindle speeds and table speeds are possible with the use of adequate holding fixtures, but because of the flexibility inherent to the material itself, extreme care is needed with regard to the methods of holding and/or clamping, in order to reduce the possibility of deformation. When milling parts with a thin cross section, the entire part should be encased in the fixture, leaving only the actual surface to be machined exposed. (Just enough opening for the cutter to enter). This prevents the part from deflecting away from the cutter. A staggered tooth roughing end mill works best for this method on a vertical mill. Cutters should be kept extremely sharp at all times to eliminate the tendency of the material to produce burrs on the milled edge. Cutters should be used ONLY for thermoplastic and never have been used on steel or other ferrous or non ferrous material. When using a shell mill, it is wise to tilt the head slightly to have just the periphery of the cutter contact the work. This will avoid cutter drag marks on the workpiece. The use of a square cornered cutter is to be preferred as well (over those with a chamfered corner) as fewer burrs will be developed over the course of the cut. If horizontal milling is required, staggered tooth side milling cutters will produce a more accurate clean slot or groove, with minimum difficulty. Slab milling cutters amy also be used, however, they require greater care to produce similar quality finishes. Chatter marks may develop and chips may accumulate in front of the cutter and get pulled into the cutting surface. Degradation of the surface can result in this case. Therefore when using slab milling cutters a slower spindle speed is advised. Burrs at the end of a run-out can be eliminated when a piece of slightly harder material (brass or aluminum for example) is placed at the end of the work where the run-out will occur. The cutter then can travel past the work piece and into the harder material. If burrs do occur they can be removed with a razor knife as a second operation. Coolant is not normally necessary in milling, although we use a synthetic flood coolant when dimensional tolerance is required. Mist systems may also be used successfully, as well as mist/air systems. The use of air also helps to blow chips away from the cut area minimizing the possibility of chips binding between the cutter and the work. I hope this will be of some help to those who are working with these and other plastics. We do a lot of work with these materials and have found the above to work quite well for our purposes. 43. Engine Turning, Jeweling, etc. (the following was contributed by Ron Bean, rbean@execpc.com) There are two questions here: how to do it, and what to call it. The latter can generate a lot of discussion that may not be relevant to the original question, but may be interesting anyway. The pattern on the Spirit of St. Louis was made with an abrasive on the end of a rod or dowel, using a drill press and some kind of step-and-repeat fixture. The size of the dowel and the amount of overlap are determined experimentally, and it may take some practice to get it right (try it on a piece of scrap first). This pattern was popular in the 1920s and '30s for instrument panels and firewalls on luxury sports cars, and occasionally body panels or other parts. It may also be seen on some bank vault doors and old safes. Many people call this process \"engine turning\", including most antique car enthusiasts. But if you ask a machinist about \"engine turning\" they may tell you about a completely different process (or not, depending on their background -- this can cause some controversy). Purists know the abrasive dowel pattern as \"jeweling\". Engine turning is done with a machine called a \"rose engine\" or \"decoration lathe\", which cuts grooves in geometric patterns similar to the old \"Spirograph\" toy. It was used to decorate the cases of pocket watches and other small items, and also to engrave printing plates for stock and bond certificates. It was developed in the 18th century and died out around WWI. There is also a \"straight line\" engine turning machine which makes similar patterns, but resembles a shaper rather than a lathe. Many people now think that \"engine turning\" just means a decorative pattern on metal, but purists try to discourage this usage. (A web search for \"engine turning\" found a lot of old pocket watches for sale, but very few photographs). Other related terms: Spotting: Similar to jeweling but done with a hollow tube. Snailing: \"A series of radial curved lines around a circle, produced with the edge of the rim of a flywheel shaped polisher.\" Guilloche: Engine turning with enameling over it, as on the Faberge eggs. For some comments on Faberge's methods, see http://unitedartworks.com under \"Techniques of Jewelry\". Ornamental turning: Any kind of decorative work done on a specially equipped lathe. These days it seems to be mostly associated with woodworking, but in the 19th century it was popular with the British aristocracy, who used ivory.

", "explanation": null, "document": "Home \\ Articles \\ Advanced articles \\ The Synergy of Magical Miniature Landscapes\nThe Synergy of Magical Miniature Landscapes\nDetails\nWritten by Robert J. Baran\n\"Bonsai\" is a term for the Japanese art of designing dwarfed trees in shallow containers. \"Penjing\" is the older Chinese form that often has wilder-looking trees and landscapes in pots.\u00a0 These two are the most common forms of what we call magical miniature landscapes, a group of arts that are philosophically-related.\u00a0 When examined closely, this particular group of creations can also be seen as related to some other human endeavors.\nThere are at least four areas of human experience ultimately employed in the creation and experiencing of the various magical miniature landscapes: Horticulture, Aesthetics, Miniatures, and Arts & Crafts.\u00a0 The accompanying schematic plots the suggested relations between these arts (and a few other creations) and these four areas.\u00a0 An approximate date is given for the earliest known representative of most of these creations.\u00a0 We acknowledge that not every last type of these landscapes is shown here.\nNow, of course, it is not necessary to be aware of this synergy \u2013 or even the history \u2013 of bonsai and related art forms in order to successfully create and experience these compositions.\u00a0 Indeed, the vast majority of artists and viewers who have, who do, and who ever will design or see a bonsai and its cousins do not know these things.\u00a0 This author does believe, however, that awareness of the larger scope of these magical miniature landscapes can be used as mental source material for a wider range of compositions and for a deeper appreciation of what we all are making and/or viewing.\nThe synergy of magical miniature landscapes:\nGlossary:\nbonkei -- Japanese miniature landscape made with real or artificial plants and rocks in a shallow \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 container.\nbonsai \u2013 dwarfed, shallow-potted, perennial woody plant <1.2 m (48\u201d) tall; aka artistic pot plant or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 table culture plant or living ming tree; originally only referred to the Japanese version, but now\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 used to describe generally any artistically-designed dwarfed potted tree.\nbonsan \u2013 Japanese miniature landscape made with sand, rock and sometimes vegetation.\nbonseki \u2013 delicate Japanese miniature landscape flat or three-dimensional made with small stones and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 white sand on a black lacquer tray; sometimes very small figurines are added for scale or theme.\nboshanlu -- ancient Chinese incense burner, generally 10-33 cm (4-13\u201d) tall, usually made of metal(s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and sometimes resting on a small dish, with perforated dome lid that is in the form of the sacred \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mountains.\nbunjae \u2013 Korean dwarfed potted trees.\ncontainers -- generally shallow, complementary-shaped holders for miniature landscapes usually with at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 least one bottom drainage hole;

[can rely] on a high level of machinery used over an extensive area of land...\u00a0 Horticulture often involves the manipulation of plant material, e.g., by propagation, by changing the above-ground environment, or by changing the root environment.\u00a0 There is a fundamental difference between production horticulture, whether producing plants themselves or plant products, and service horticulture, i.e., the development and upkeep of gardens and landscape for their amenity, cultural and recreational values.\u00a0 Increasingly, horticulture can be seen to be involved with social well-being and welfare through the impact of plants for human physical and mental health...\u201d\n\u201cThere is a feature common to all the aspects of horticulture: the grower or gardener benefits from knowing about the factors that may increase or decrease the plant's growth and development.\u201d\n(Adams, Charles R. and Michael P. Early\u00a0 Principles of horticulture; Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann; 2004, pp. 1,2)\nAesthetics:\n\u201c...to reduce the amount of vegetative growth that cannot be supported by the loss of root mass following transplanting.\u00a0 This is also the principle behind the cultural practices of\u00a0 the bonsai in containers and pollarding in some European cities to offset low soil volume in confined urban settings.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some times when aesthetics is the primary reason for pruning.\u00a0 Pruning can be done to remove branches to expose ornamental features of the bark or the shape of the tree trunk.\u00a0 Pruning limbs to expose or enhance vistas is sometimes done and also can be done to train a young tree into a desired form.\u00a0 Techniques such as pollarding, espalier, topiary, hedge work, and bonsai are frequently done for aesthetic reasons.\u201d\n(Kuser, John E.\u00a0 Handbook of urban and community forestry in the northeast; New York: Springer, 2000; pp. 197, 207)\nMiniatures:\n\u201c...Miniatures are small things that do not seek accuracy in representation, that are not precise or exact.\u00a0 Furthermore, miniatures result from human experimentation with the physical world; they are cultural creations.\u00a0 In this sense there are no naturally occurring miniatures; each one is a person's utilization of eye and hand to manipulate the world...\n[Dwarfed trees in the wild are non-human natural; those same trees collected and put in pots become bonsai or bonsai-in-training, a human creation - RJB.]\n\u201cBonsai... is a replacement of the complexity of the life-size tree with the simplicity of convention.\u00a0 Bonsai compresses information and detail about the texture of the bark, the subtleties of colour, and the structure of fine branches...\u201d\n\u201cScholars' rocks... provide a physical stimulus, a tangible but imaginary vehicle for travel through an imagined landscape.\u00a0 The rock sitting on a scholar's desk both provides a concrete reality and suggests places that belong to the other worlds of established mythologies.\u00a0 Scholars' rocks work because they possess the capacity to suggest imaginary retreats; while some detail stimulates memory, the specific details, of cloud and water for example, are left to the viewer's imagination...\n\u201cIn representing trees, rocks and landscapes, the artists creating bonsai, scholars' rocks and penjing manipulate scale to transform the real world into separate, intimate alternatives.\u00a0 They create images of reality that flip back and forth between the natural and cultural worlds... [and in this way]\u00a0 transform viewers' ways of seeing and thinking.\u201d\n\u201cMiniature manipulation of reality works from two processes: abstraction and compression.\u00a0\u00a0 [This] reduction of size [also] reduces details.\u00a0 The resulting, intentional, understatement provides much of the power of a miniature because [the process] demands selection...\u00a0 The brevity that comes with abstract representation forces the viewer beyond the information that is provided.\u00a0 The abstraction of a miniature demands that a spectator draws inferences ...to think of what is not there, of what has been left out.\u00a0 Where are the other trees?\u00a0 Where are the little birds that should surround the bonsai?\u00a0 Where is the rest of the mountain that is invoked by the scholars' rock?\n\u201cThrough abstraction, a miniature is an object made active; it forces the viewers to do something that otherwise they would not do...\u00a0 Critically, the range of inferences that any one viewer can draw are almost limitless; constraints depend only on each viewers' beliefs, understandings, interests, backgrounds and desires...\n\u201cCompression further contributes to the distancing of miniaturization from factual modelling...\u00a0 Miniaturization concentrates and distills what is normal in peoples' routine day-to-day activities and thoughts and then produces a deeper expression of a part of that reality.\n\u201c...By reducing the world-at-large's reality, a miniature provides a way of making sense of that world...\u00a0 By providing the better understanding and physical control over a thing, miniaturism suggests security and thus brings pleasure.\u00a0 By creating a world in which the human scale matters most and dictates all spatial relationships, miniaturism reassures and liberates the viewer.\u00a0 In so doing and in making the viewer powerful and all-knowing, a miniature object makes the viewer free to indulge in flights of fantasy.\u201d\n\u201c..[T]hree-dimensional representations allow complete comprehension.\u00a0 They give the spectator the highest degree of authority to change their position of viewing and thus of understanding; every side can be seen, nothing is left to the imagination, nothing is hidden or left out.\n\u201cOn the other hand, and this is the paradox, in moving around the sculpture or turning over the figurine in one's hand, the spectator (or the handler) never holds the entire view at any one time...\u00a0 In this sense, three-dimensional objects escape complete comprehension.\u00a0 They can never, simultaneously, be viewed in their entirety.\u201d\n(Bailey, Douglass Whitfield\u00a0 Prehistoric figurines; Oxford: Routledge, 2005; pp. 29, 30, 32-33)\nArts & Crafts:\n\u201cBonsai (and suiseki) thus isn't simply nature as it is; it is nature in a super concentrated form, a form that is squeezed, compacted, and multiplied in intensity.\u00a0 In the case of bonsai, and ikebana and other crafts, we can think of Japanese art as nature reinterpreted and intensified, a distillation of its essential quality.\n\u201cThus, the painstaking pruning and wiring of bonsai are not meant to reproduce nature as it is but to produce something beyond what is usually found in nature: simply to copy nature pales in comparison.\u00a0 It is when the life force and creativity of the artist \u2013 the human being as a functioning part of nature \u2013 merge with the essence and rhythm of nature that something wondrous results.\u00a0 The result is art \u2013 not Japanese art \u2013 but art...\u201d\n\u201cThe idea of asymmetry is one example.\u00a0 Just as flowers do not grow in neat rows in the wilderness, symmetry is avoided in a Japanese garden or in ikebana.\u00a0 Nature is 'arranged' in the traditional Japanese arts, but the arrangement accords with the intrinsic movement of ki in nature.\u00a0 Thus, in general an ikebana artist will bend a flower, but not so much that it will be forced into a shape that it would not exhibit in nature...\u201d\n\u201cIn bonsai, suiseki, and the arrangement of a traditional garden, Japanese art aims to capture the essential nature of tree, stone, landscape, to create a work of art that exemplifies the very core of these things, and ultimately, the substance of nature itself.\u00a0 This aim begins with the recognition of the fundamental character of the thing the artist is working with and progresses to a 'sculpting' of the material to intensify the expression of its intrinsic character.\u00a0 A Japanese gardener works 'with the grain,' and as he prunes and shapes, he reveals an aspect of beauty that is born in nature but that nature has hidden in its abundance.\n\u201cJapanese art aims to discern and then liberate what has always been present.\u00a0 And who are we to assume that such liberation is needed?\u00a0 Humanity is a part of nature.\u00a0 We, like the flowers in ikebana and the trees and shrubs in the niwa [garden], are part of the infinite variety that is the universe.\u00a0 We are transitory and timeless, existing in the eternal present, just like the aspects of nature we create with.\u00a0 In perceiving and freeing aspects of nature that have always existed, we ultimately see into our own nature.\n\u201cIn Japan native arts both humble and dignify their participants.\u00a0 Humankind is forced to recognize its mortality and the fact of impermanence.\u00a0 But in seeing our smallness in the universe, we discover our link to something infinitely large, eternal, and awesome.\u201d\n(Davey, H. E.\u00a0 Living the Japanese Arts & Ways: 45 Paths to Meditation & Beauty; Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press, LLC; 2003, pp. 62-63, 83-84)\nAnd it is a form of the wood-working craft we do when we create, carve, and shape deadwood branches (jin), strips of deadwood on trunks (shari), or \u201csimply\u201d bend trunks or branches with wire, weights, twisting, or heating.\nAs hinted in the chart, the stands and containers used to display and hold our compositions also involve levels of creativity.\nThese are just a few representative thoughts about these four aspects which come together in our interests.\u00a0 What are other quotes or thoughts relevant to the further understanding of magical miniature landscapes?\u00a0\u00a0 And if this x,y chart were made three-dimensional, would the z-axis include such characteristics as duration, age, or amount of experience?\nThe principal sources of information for the above terms are http://www.phoenixbonsai.com/Terms.html; Phan Van Lit with Lew Buller\u00a0 Mountains in the Sea (Portland, OR: Timber Press; 2001); and Kora Dalager, \u201cShitakusa versus Kusamono,\u201d http://www.snowcrest.net/windowboxnursery/articles/kora.htm, among others.\nWritten by: Robert J.

We still have plenty of blackberry, blueberry and strawberry jam. This year, we're expanding into root veggies, some lettuces, beans, peas, and more. We added apple trees and cranberries last year, as well as grapes, and this year, we should get our first apples, cranberries and grapes.

I have a 25' x 10' veggie garden area (that's enough garden work for me) that I'm preparing to convert to four raised beds that are each about 11' x 4', generally following this excellent design with somewhat cheaper materials: http://www.sunset.com/garden/perfect-raised-bed-00400000039550/.\nMarch 23, 2012 at 8:11 am |\nBill\nTried growing peppers and tomatoes last year, but the killer heat last summer fried the plant blossoms as soon as they would start opening up, and nothing germinated. Will try again this year, hoping that our summer isn't quite as bad as last year.\nAlso tried container gardening during the winter, with the natural (shorter day) sunlight augmented with grow lights. Unfortunately, it seems I picked too small of containers. While the bell pepper plants grew well, the peppers themselves won't fill out to full size (they're staying small diameter, like a large jalapeno would be). Also, even though they were being cared for all winter, many of the plants didn't really start growing large until after the winter equinox, when the daylight hours started increasing again.\nI do have some onions growing in 5 gallon buckets, that seem to finally be getting large (rule of thumb for onions, one leaf above ground for each ring of onion......so wait until they've got a bunch of leaves to pick them), and some new pepper plants I started are now growing like gangbusters. I also planted some garlic outside. It's supposed to go dormant in the winter, then continue growing in the spring, but our winter never got cold enough to make it do so, and now those plants are getting huge!\nGarlic is also extremely simple to plant and grow, so you might consider it as a first crop, if you think you don't have much of a green thumb.\nMarch 23, 2012 at 8:00 am |\nmy tea mom\nOMG, you grew small peppers?! Envy! These are my favourites \u2013 I stuff them with herbed cream cheese for snacks, and stuff and braise them for dinner (in tomato sauce, over rice). Happy growing!\nMarch 23, 2012 at 12:03 pm |\ndancingfrog\nFor those who are interested in bucket or container gardening, we went to several supermarkets & got the 2 gal.plastic buckets from the bakery dept. for \"free'\" w/the lids if you want them. These buckets will end up in the dumpster anyway, so you might as well get as many as you need. Most are already cleaned out, but, you can fill your bathtub w/hot dish detergent & soak for a few minutes, then wash them & rinse them under the shower, if you have one. When dry poke holes in the bottom of the buckets w/an ice pick, nail & hammer, or drill small holes in the bottom for drainage. Be careful you don't hurt yourself. If you're so inclinded, there is spray paint for plastic, you can paint your \"free\" plastic buckets any color(s) you like. You can use newspapers in the bottom of the buckets, or several flattened out coffee filters, small gravel, broken ceramic pottery, some contractors sand or sand from whereever, & then potting soil. I also used some vermiculite w/the soil for a looser mix. Plant tomato seeds, pepper seeds, herb seeds, or buy plants already started from your favorite garden dept. of your fav store. Or maybe you have a \"freecycle\" web-site in your town & can find plants for almost free or free. Be sure your plants get good sunshine/water/fertilize as needed. Tomato plants will need some sort of support as they grow taller, tomato cages aren't too expensive, & can be used yr after yr. It doesn't take much talent, & you'll be rewarded w/something good to eat. These buckets work for fruit as well as veggies. Good luck.\nMarch 23, 2012 at 2:05 am |\nkarenj\nKitty litter buckets with holes punched in the bottom, if you don't buy laundry detergent in big pails, which also do....\nMarch 29, 2012 at 11:42 pm |\nCindy\nWhen you think of the desert in phoenix you think brown...not in my back yard. I use soil right in the bag \u2013 I take a 2 cubic foot bag od dirt, cut a rectangle in the top, poke dranage holes in it and plant right in the bag, it smothers the weeds underneath. And my favorite is kiddie pools, take a knife and poke drain holes, right now my 2 pools are loaded with beets, lettuce, parsley, cabbages and carrotts. I even grew corn in it last year.

Sometimes it was small, sometimes bigger depending upon where I lived. i just made do with what I had. There is nothing like watching things grow, getting good exercise bending, kneeling, digging and stooping. I save tons of money and I know the food is safe and fresh. There is nothing like basil, tomatoes and cucumbers fresh out of the garden.

As a typical kid, I was interested until I reached the age of 13, appreciated it at 20 but with no motivation to do it. As a homeowner now at 37, I had a eureka moment a few weeks back that I should grow my own vegetables now, not just because I should, but because I have a 5 month old son who hopefully share the same enthusiasm about gardening at 7 that I did. If I get started now, I can fine-tune the skills by the time he is of age. Now I just have to find the best spot on my 1/4 acre lot to start.

No experience growing food, but my mother had lots of house plants. I puttered with vegetable gardening for years but no earnest effort. The 2 months before my daughter was born I made 270sq. ft. of raised beds, determined to have her grow up knowing that food doesn't come from a store. 3 years on, she is outside with me in the garden whenever I am out. Sure, it slows me down when she 'helps\" but her enthusiasm is so undeniable. She goes crazy when things fruit (especially the watermelons) she talks to them and asks if they are doing ok, and if they need anything. Its awesome. Its so rewarding and an amazing adventure for you and yours. Best of luck!\nMarch 23, 2012 at 2:06 pm |\nalr\nI've grown basil and Italian parsley with much success.

This is my first spring going to plant here and I have been laboring HARD to break up the clods of soil that is full of clay. There seems to be an earthworm in every 3 square inches of dirt here. I've started seed indoors to transplant outside but I can't believe how labor intensive the ground preparation is without fancy tools and machinery. I try to imagine I'm really hungry and my survival depends on making my soil fine enough for young tender plants.\nMarch 24, 2012 at 3:09 pm | Reply\nRichardHead@checi\nYour gonna do just fine. Finding the earthworms is a plus,which means they are below the freeze line and active. The soil is just now drying out from winter and yes it is a little tough.

Looked into the bottom of the trashcan and said to myself \"Hmmm, wonder if they'll grow?\" So I put them in a pot with old potting soil and sure enough they sprouted and I got orange trees.

I put rosemary, chives, sage and edible lavender in pots last spring. On the winter solstice I brought them inside and they started growing like mad. Since then I planted white onions and cilantro in pots and am about to put in peppers, thyme and oregano. I still need some tomato seeds and plan to put them in one of those upside-down planters among my flowering hanging baskets. Even though it only was in for about a month, I have been using the cilantro every four days or so. I cut the top inch off everything (it is in an 18\" clay pot) and have enough for the meal. Four days later the leaves have grown back up and are ready for another harvest. The only concern is that I wanted to let it go to seed so I could have some coriander and more seeds for the next crop and if I keep cutting it I don't know if it will generate seeds.\nI guess I will find out...\nMarch 23, 2012 at 2:57 pm | Reply\ngardengirl\nI loved this article and it's positive tone.

For one thing, it may be GMO, but if it isn't, and even if it's organic, it's almost certainly a hybrid. And hybrid seeds absolutely don't breed true. In fact they can grow perfectly awful plants.

Will try again this year, hoping that our summer isn't quite as bad as last year.\nAlso tried container gardening during the winter, with the natural (shorter day) sunlight augmented with grow lights. Unfortunately, it seems I picked too small of containers. While the bell pepper plants grew well, the peppers themselves won't fill out to full size (they're staying small diameter, like a large jalapeno would be). Also, even though they were being cared for all winter, many of the plants didn't really start growing large until after the winter equinox, when the daylight hours started increasing again.\nI do have some onions growing in 5 gallon buckets, that seem to finally be getting large (rule of thumb for onions, one leaf above ground for each ring of onion......so wait until they've got a bunch of leaves to pick them), and some new pepper plants I started are now growing like gangbusters. I also planted some garlic outside. It's supposed to go dormant in the winter, then continue growing in the spring, but our winter never got cold enough to make it do so, and now those plants are getting huge!\nGarlic is also extremely simple to plant and grow, so you might consider it as a first crop, if you think you don't have much of a green thumb.\nMarch 23, 2012 at 8:00 am | Reply\nmy tea mom\nOMG, you grew small peppers?!

These buckets will end up in the dumpster anyway, so you might as well get as many as you need. Most are already cleaned out, but, you can fill your bathtub w/hot dish detergent & soak for a few minutes, then wash them & rinse them under the shower, if you have one. When dry poke holes in the bottom of the buckets w/an ice pick, nail & hammer, or drill small holes in the bottom for drainage. Be careful you don't hurt yourself. If you're so inclinded, there is spray paint for plastic, you can paint your \"free\" plastic buckets any color(s) you like. You can use newspapers in the bottom of the buckets, or several flattened out coffee filters, small gravel, broken ceramic pottery, some contractors sand or sand from whereever, & then potting soil. I also used some vermiculite w/the soil for a looser mix. Plant tomato seeds, pepper seeds, herb seeds, or buy plants already started from your favorite garden dept. of your fav store. Or maybe you have a \"freecycle\" web-site in your town & can find plants for almost free or free. Be sure your plants get good sunshine/water/fertilize as needed. Tomato plants will need some sort of support as they grow taller, tomato cages aren't too expensive, & can be used yr after yr. It doesn't take much talent, & you'll be rewarded w/something good to eat. These buckets work for fruit as well as veggies. Good luck.\nMarch 23, 2012 at 2:05 am | Reply\nCindy\nWhen you think of the desert in phoenix you think brown...not in my back yard.

For my flower gardens I use organic spray- daily for about a week or so, then occasionally. However, with the veg, the animals are very, very, determined, and I don't like to spray our food. My husband built a big box using 2X4 studs. (NOT pressure treated as it's full of chemicals)The box is 12 feet square and 6 feet high and sits on top of our 2 foot high raised bed. It was then covered with chicken wire. You could use deer fencing- it's cheaper. It's about 8 feet high. we had a shorter cage, but the deer jumped over it. I painted the wood in festive colors, and it looks cool. It means spending some cash, but we found some of the wood at the dump!!

In the last two decades or so, a new environment, the middoors, has become familiar to most of us in the form of the enclosed, climate-controlled streets and plazas of many a shopping mall. The \"landscaped,\" sunlit central atrium in some new hotel and office buildings offers another kind of model.\nOn the Moon, the middoors will be that part of the settlement within its minibiosphere that is commonspace: parks, some agricultural areas, malls, even the maze of pressurized streets and passageways. Within the middoors temperatures might be allowed to fluctuate on daily and seasonal patterns according to the \"climate\" chosen by the settlement founders.\nThe middoors unites all pressurized spaces so that one can go anywhere in the settlement without a space suit, but possibly with seasonal outerwear.\nThe Middoors is to be distinguished not only from the fully exposed out-vac , but from the protected lee-vac reserved for warehousing and other activities including some kinds of sports activities.\nMini-G(ravity)\n-\u00a0a gravity level significantly larger than the \"micro-gravity\" of within structures in free space \u00a0but smaller than that needed as an aid to bodily functions.\nIf human physiological adaptation to Lunar 1/6th gravity or sixthweight turns out to be acceptable, that would mean we could also adapt to worlds with very similar gravities: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan.\nOne-sixth gravity is mathematically infinitely greater than zero gravity, and common prognostication based on experience of long duration stays in orbit that we can't adapt to lunar gravity is intellectually not deserving of respect. Physiological levels could deteriorate on the Moon as well, but then level off on a plateau significantly higher than we find for astronauts who stay a year or more in orbit. The only way to be sure is to take the plunge. Putting personnel on the Moon for stays of a year or more will tell. The betting odds are with the immense adaptability of life.\nBut adaptation to the much lower gravity of Ceres at barely 3% G or 1/6th Lunar gravity, might be less successful. And from there, among the asteroids, its all downhill.\nMonotreme drain systems\nMoon, the Moon, the moon\n- two comments:\n(1) Sometimes the dictionary can be dead wrong. For all the reasons \"Moon\" should be capitalized when referring to Luna, see \"Capital \"M\" for Moon\" MMM Classics # 4, page 2. The Editor will die rather than yield on this point.\n(2) One now hears and reads \"Earth\" without the \"The\" before it. Usage is changing. It is probably only a matter of time before are commonly referring to Moon, rather than The Moon. Usage has always defined what is correct. It is only recently that self-appointed guardians of the language have attempted to petrify it in a state to their pedantic taste.\nMoonbagel\n- see Hybrid Rigid Inflatables\nMoondust Lawnmower\n- A device proposed by Dr. Lawrence Taylor, U-TN that capitalizes on the magnetic character of nanophase iron that is fairly uniformly distributed in the regolith powder fines that comprise 80% of moondust by weight. This is one of several new concepts that plays upon the mischevious characteristics of moondust to control it.\nMoondust Vacuum Cleaner\n- A device proposed by Dr. Lawrence Taylor, U-TN that capitalizes on the magnetic character of nanophase iron that is fairly uniformly distributed in the regolith powder fines that comprise 80% of moondust by weight. Also described as a magnetic \"elephant trunk\" that sucks up lunar dust. This is one of several new concepts that plays upon the mischevious characteristics of moondust to control it.\nMoon Flags - This entry is under construction\nMoonlegs\n- We all saw how the astronauts loped around on the Moon. But they were there only for a short time, a few days at most. Will future Moon-stationed personnel, in larger pressurized habitats where they could try real \"walking\" without spacesuits (no room to try that in the cramped Lunar Modules!) learn to walk more naturally? Or will even those personnel stationed for years on the Moon, still fail to find their \"moonlegs.\"\nMaybe we will have to see how native born Lunans grow up and handle \"walking\" and \"running\" and sports activities. \u00a0The Apollo lope might turn out to be something peculiar to newcomers.\nGetting around on Mars will be an adjustment also, but a lesser one.\nMoon roofs\n- At first it may seem a stretch of an analogy, but a mound of regolith over a habitat structure sheds micrometeorite rain and protects from other cosmic weather much like the roof of a terrestrial home.\nBut unlike common homes on Earth, this \"moon roof\" will often be the only exposed evidence of the shelter below, and options to decorate and personalize this covering may be a welcome opportunity to some pioneers.\nSee \"Moonroofs\" - MMM Classics #6, page 23.\nMoon surface area compared to Earth\n- Many people do not have a good grasp of how the Moon compares to Earth in size. It is much smaller, but yet of considerable size.\nAs small as it looks, the Moon has a surface area of over 14 million square miles, about as much as:\n\u2022 Africa\nand Australia combined (closest match) - it is a very common mistake to say \"as large as Africa\" which is more than 2 million square miles less extensive than the Moon.\n\u2022 \u00a0Africa\nand Europe (less Russia) combined, or\n\u2022 Canada,\nthe USA, China and Brazil combined - picture Canada and the USA covering the nearside, China and Brazil covering the farside.\nWhile Earth\nhas 13.5 times as much surface area, the full Earth, as seen from the Moon is 60 times brighter than the full Moon seen from Earth. While the Moon's surface is fairly dark, Earth's clouds and snow and ice packs reflect a lot of light.\nMoonwood\n- an as yet untried experiment to determine if fiberglass-sulfur composites would produce a useful building or craft material on the Moon. Ever since it became mandated to clean coal-burning exhaust of sulfur, sulfur has become so cheap on the market that many experiments have been performed including sulfur roofing shingles and sulfur building blocks.\nThis is a ventilated basement workshop project that has not been tried for lack of time. Stay tuned.\nM.U.S./c.l.e. Strategy for Lunar Industrial Design\n- You will have noticed that our \"muscle\" was spelled as a two part acronym, \"M.U.S. - c.l.e.\". For our strategy calls for the M.U.S ( Massive, Unitary, Simple ) parts to be made by the settlement and the c.l.e. ( Complex, Lightweight, and Electronic ) components to be made on Earth for upport and mating on the Moon ( or early space colony ). Here then is the logical formula for giving industrial muscle to the early settlement still too small to diversify into a maze of subcontracting establishments. It is a path that has been trod before. It plays on the strengths of the lunar situation and relies on the early basic industries: lunacrete, iron-steel, ceramic, and glass-glass composites (Glax\u2122).\nAB | CD | EF | GH | I\u00a0J | KL | MN | OP | QR | ST | UV | WX | YZ\nNecton Speed\n- How fast do we have to go to be meaningfully star-faring? Stars routinely drift through space on their various circum-galactic orbits at speeds relative to one another up to 30 km/sec. \u00a0That's 1/10,000th the speed of light. A space craft attempting to travel beyond the solar system at a speed of that rate or lower is in fact, only \"drifting\" between the stars. We have dubbed that \"Plankton Speed\" Plankton are multi-cellular creatures that drift in the ocean. Nekton are those that truly \"swim.\"\nWhether we are talking of unmanned probes, or hypothetical interstellar Arks or seed ships, if we are not doing one thousandth of the speed of light, 300 km per second, \"we ain't going nowhere!\"\nNegative Zero-G,\nNegative micro-gravity\n- these may seem absurd concepts but consider!\nVesta, the second or third largest asteroid after Ceres (the other is Pallas), is arguably the largest solid rock body with a cold interior, in a convenient orbit. (Pallas which might otherwise qualify, is inclined to the general solar system plane by 35\u00b0)\nDrill/excavate a shaft to its gravitational center of masss. At that point anything will experience negative micro-gravity with equal pull from Vesta's own mass in all directions outward. Would there be advantages for placing the ultimate physics lab at this location?\nNephthele\n- in Mythology, Queen of the Centaurs. We proposed giving her name to Alpha Centauri B. Alpha Centauri is a twin sun binary\u00a0system and close enough a neighbor to merit giving its two suns individual names. See Ixion .\nSee Alpha Centauri, MMM Classics #5 pp 13-15\nNiagara Interglacial\n- in a friendly amendment to the BC (BCE) / AD (CE) dating system, we propose adding an even 10,000 years so that for most of datable human events, all dates are positive numbers. This system would much better reflect the age of human culture, and by keeping the current year 1 A.D. as 10,001 retain the \"christocalibration of the current dating system for the many to whom this is important. In fact 10,001 seems more pregnant with significance than 1\nBut in this revision the era designations BC, AD, BCE (before common era), and CE (common era) are equally inapplicable. We proposed NI, Niagara Interglacial as a name for our current geological/climatological period. Welcome to the 121st Century! That does suggest a much richer human heritage, one much more deserving of protection and of carrying on and preserving, a goal that should motivate all of us, those who would stay on Earth and those that would carry Earth Life and Culture outward to seed the Solar System and beyond.\nNightspan - Dayspan\n- what about the terms \"day\" and \"night\" themselves as they apply to timekeeping on the Moon?\nWithin the pressurized light-controlled living areas, settlers will want to maintain the 24 hour standard sequence, and to use the terms \"day\" and \"night\" accordingly.\nTo avoid confusion, they will either need to qualify those given terms or find other ones when referring to the sunshine-darkness periods on the surface, fourteen plus times as long, or sluggish. After playing with a lot of possible expressions and new coinages, we published a suggestion several years ago to use the terms \"dayspan\" and \"nightspan\" for these longer periods. These terms are being borrowed by a number of other writers.\nNimby ports - N.I.M.B.Y.\n- \"Not In My Back Yard!\" - toxic wastes unwelcome most anywhere on Earth could be shipped to isolated locations on the Moon, where the sterile landscape imposes quarantine and isolation. At such sites, they could be \"mined\" for valuable elements and compounds. This could conceivably become a significant sector for the lunar economy.\nSee Port N.I.M.B.Y. - MMM Classics # 4, pp 15-17\nNocturne\n- see Diurne\nNorth\n- the direction to the left of spinward (East). In artificial gravity envrionments, it makes a difference! See East\nNuclear Fuels Industry on the Moon?\n- Orbital probes have identified areas of the Moon that are rich in Thorium, an element that can be turned into fissionable Uranium-233 in a breeder reactor. Should, at some time in the future, transport not of nuclear engines, but of nuclear fuel through Earths atmosphere be forbidden by treaty, Lunar Thorium could fuel fleets of fast nuclear powered rockets that would better be able to open the Mars Frontier. Of all things a Moon settlement could do to support the penning of Mars, this might come at the top.\nAB | CD | EF | GH | I\u00a0J | KL | MN | OP | QR | ST | UV | WX | YZ\nObliviside\n-\u00a0a more appropriate \"nickname\" for the lunar farside. Pioneers who settle here will\u00a0 be quicker to evolve their culture into something less reminiscent of Earth, which being always \"out of sight\" will the sooner become \"out of mind.\" Of course, those who visit nearside often will be proportionately slower to feel this effect.\nOceanids or Europids\n- Europa-like moons . with ample water oceans kept liquid by tidally-induced heating under vacuum-packed ice crust seals.\nSuch moons, circling\u00a0gas giant planets or brown dwarfs whether these \"primaries\" orbit\u00a0suns, as does Jupiter, or are interstellar rogues could be by far the most common type of environment for emergent life in the universe. \"Europids\" could outnumber \"Earth-type\" planets a thousand to one.\nSee \"Oceanids\" in MMM Classic #4 pp. \u00a047-49.\nOochie engines\n- engines that burn bottled oxygen (O2, or OO) with bottled methane (CH4)\nNatural gas which is mostly Methane, fuels many vehicles today. However the motors burn it with the oxygen in air which is 4/5th nitrogen. Methane power is also common in farm-run machinery, as this gas is a derivative of compost manure decay;\nIf we experimented with engines that burn pure methane and pure oxygen, we could debug and accelerate the development of mature technology engines that would power vehicles and generators on Mars. Why wait until we get there? This could be a University level engineering challenge competition with annual potential.\nOort Foam\n- the Oort cloud of icy comet-like bodies is imagined to extend outward from the sun for a light year or more. If this type of outer solar system population is common, then the fringes of separate Oort clouds must frequently commingle.\nOccasionally on scales of tens of millions of years, we experience a comet rain with potential consequences for interrupting the peaceful progress of evolution on Earth.\nWhy chalk this up to a passing star interfering with our own Oort cloud. Is it not more obvious that these events occur as our solar system passes through the Oort cloud of another star as we pass one another in our separate routes around the galaxy core?\nSee \"Oort Foam\" MMM Classic #4, pp. 62-63\n\"Open\" Space Frontier\n- \"A future in which people of all walks of life have access to, and live, work, and play in various settings off Earth.\"\nThe NSS Mission Statement reads: \"to promote change in social, technical, economic, and political conditions to advance the day when people will live and work in space, through public education, political and local chapter activism, and the publication of the bi-monthly Ad Astra Magazine.\"\nThe NSS \"Mission-centered goal: by 2010: human settlement in space with 25 people, launch costs under $50/lb to orbit, and space-generated revenues of $60 billion.\"\nThis reflects crucial influence of former L5 Society members who chose to stay on board at the time of the L5 - National Space Institute merger in 1987 which created NSS.\nAs NSS seems overtly preoccupied with reacting to one crisis after another in which political pressures would erode the current socialized space program (in the direction of no program at all) it might seem to the unfamiliar outside observer that NSS' sole purpose is to promote the continuance of the government's \"closed\" frontier policy (\"astronauts only, government outposts only, scientific activities only\") in effect since the dawn of the Space Age with Sputnik in 1957. The NSS Board, however, is firmly on record in support of an \"open\" frontier. Given its preoccupation, however, it is clear that the rest of us must work that much harder at strategies that Open the Frontier; outside NSS, if need be.\nOpenvac\n- a vehicle or other activity platform that does not have a pressurized compartment for the driver or operator, but is open to the surrounding vacuum on the Moon or similar bodies. On Mars something similar might be dubbed \"open-marsair\"\nOra, Orae\n- a term meaning \"Coast\" or \"Coastal Land\"-\u00a0 a term suggested for a proposed by the editor for the\n.\nOrange\n- (paint color) see regolith impressionism - Unsupportable lunar options are Uranium-cadmium and chromium-iron-zinc. Glazers may have to blend available reds and yellows such as ferric oxide and sulfur.\nFor Stained Glass , unsupportable lunar options are Uranium-cadmium and chromium-iron-zinc. Glazers may have to blend available reds and yellows.\nOrbitel\n- an orbiting hotel (parallel to motel from motor hotel)\nOregon Moonbase\n- During the late 1980s and 1990s, the Oregon L5 Society NSS chapter conducted moonbase exercises in this lavatube outside of Bend, Oregon, involving students. They put together a PVC framework and covered it with tarps to simulate the base. The volcanic ash (from the eruption of Mount Mazama - - now, minus the mountain top, Crater Lake -- 7,000 years earlier) that had washed into the cave over the years, serves as a good analog of moon dust. The chapter won a NASA SBIR grant to explore future Oregon Moonbase development options. The site was subsequently abandoned.\nOut-vac\n- (modeled on the Australian term Outback, meaning the big backyard of the continent behind the coastal cities) - The out-vac signifies the vacuum-washed surface of the Moon outside of pressurized vehicle, outpost, and settlement environments.\nOut-vac is distinguished from Lee-vac environments which are unpressurized but shielded from the cosmic elements: cosmic rays, solar flares, micrometeorite rain, and large thermal variations. Out-vac might be thought of as windward vacuum, \"lee\" meaning away from or protected from the wind.\nOut-vac excursions require more protection, i.e. heavier and more cumbersome space suits, whereas lee-vacuum activities need only counterpressure skinsuits, lighter to ware, and providing greater freedom of motion, hence less fatigue.\nLee-vac environments are ideal for warehousing, storage, and sports activities.\nAB | CD | EF | GH | I\u00a0J | KL | MN | OP | QR | ST | UV | WX | YZ\nParkway\n- In creating a minibiosphere, each module whether it be a habitat or activity area or a public corridor/walkway (cunnicular) or a pressurized street or road, should be making a contribution to the total mass of the biosphere and to the functions of water and air recycling and refreshing.\nCunnicular pedestrian tubes should have living walls throughout their length. And similarly all pressurized vehicle tubes should use available lower slopes and or medians for vegetation. This vegetation can be ornamental, or consist of harvested species: fruit, fiber, herb, dyestuff, spice producing plants.\nSee \" Farm Village \" and \"Parkway\" in MMM Classics #1 page 25\nPeek-a-boos\n[Giving different areas of the Moon's Nearside Hemisphere different names according to how well Earth is visible.] Adjacent to the \" postcardlands \", straddling the \u201climb\u201d of the lunar globe which forever keeps the same side turned towards Earth are \u201cthe Peek-a-boos\u201d.\nBecause the Moon\u2019s axis is not perpendicular to its orbit around the Earth and because that orbit is somewhat eccentric and the Moon travels faster when nearer Earth and slower when further away, all the while rotating at a fixed rate, about 7\u00b0 to either side of the 90\u00b0 East and 90\u00b0 West lines are alternately turned towards Earth and away from Earth.\nSome settlers may prefer to locate in the \"peek-a-boos\" as they get to experience the glory of darker, \"Earthless Skies\" with the full beauty of the Milky Way, alternately with Earth rising, just above the horizon, and setting, in a cycle repeated every lunar month or \" sunth \"\nSee \" Crooknecks \" - \" Postcardlands \" - \" Obliviside \"\nPentroof\n- inspired by the tiered roofs of the oriental pagoda, a pentroof is a way of shielding individual stories of a lunar \"skyscraper\" such as an office tower or hotel. See illustrations below.\nPermeclipse\n- An area of a body from which another body is always hidden. From the Moon's farside, exclusive of the limb areas, the Earth is always in eclipse.\nAs most planetary satellites or moons are likewise rotationally locked, they all have farsides from which the primary (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) is always hidden.\nAs Pluto is also gravitationally locked with Charon, like Charon, Pluto itself has a farside from which Charon is never visible.\nPermashade\n- Permanently shaded area in a polar or circumpolar crater, presumably a place that cometary volatiles could have been preserved\nPig-squeal mining\n- see Tailings and Throughput\nPicture Window Clich\u00e9s\n- On Earth we often see a Lamp in the middle of a Picture Window. Lunar pioneers may switch to a different clich\u00e9. They will be less concerned with how their homestead looks from the outside than with how barren and desolate and lifeless the moonscape looks from the inside. Instead of a lamp, house plants may serve to psychologically buffer the view.\nPink\n- (paint color) see regolith impressionism (we got fair results mixing titanium dioxide white with ferric oxide rust)\nFor Stained Glass , Lead chromate and chrome tin pinks are out - little or no lead or tin. Chromium-zirconium is a possible substitute. A manganese-alumina pink and a chromium-alumina pinkish red are other choices. Eventually, cobalt-magnesium combinations might produce a pink to lilac range .\nPlanetization\n-\u00a0The state of a civilization that has become global, enveloping its whole home world economically, with intercontinental travel commonplace.\nPlankton speed\n- see Nekton Speed\nPleiad\n- In MMM's first lunar calendar proposal, which called for pairs of sunths (lunar day-night cycle) of 59 days, in which there would be eight weeks or pleiads, of which 5 would have the traditional 7 days, and three would have an 8th day, incorporated into a 3-day weekend. This proposal derives from the fact that the Pleiades, a prominent northern star cluster in Earth's skys, is on the Moon's celestial equator and visible from anywhere on the Moon except very near to either pole. The Pleiades are known as the \"Seven Sisters\" but there are an 8th and 9th named star in the group, which is convenient to this naming system.\nThe stars of the Pleiades which can be seen from almost anywhere on the Moon:\n\u2022 Alcyone | Merope | Electra | Celaeno | Taygeta | Asterope | Maia (and 8th, Pleione and/or Atlas, 3 weeks out of 8. They were the parents of the famous seven sisters).\n\u2022 Note: \"Pleiades\" was the name chosen by Artemis Society International, for its original short-lived newsletter.\nPleione-8A\n-\u00a0 taking turns with Atlas as the 8th day of long Pleiads with 3-day weekends - See \" Pleiad \"\nPlugstrip\n- In the interior walls of locally constructed habitat modules, an embedded electrical service strip into which appliance cord plugs could be inserted at frequent intervals, e.g. every meter (40\") or half meter (20\")\nPlyxanth\n- a term suggested for a hypothetical building material built up of cross plies of fiberglass impregnated sulfur. That such a material can be made is not in question. Whether or not it could be useful (much less take the place of our familiar \"plywood\") can only be decided through experimentation. \"Xanth\" is a Greek-derived term meaning \"yellow,\" i.e. the color of sulfur.\nPodokinetic(s), devices\n- Literally \"foot-powered\" as with a device connected to a bicycle stand that generates DC electric power to run various devices. Widespread use of such devices by those living and working in lower gravity environments, would allow them to maintain physiological health while engaging in recreational pursuits that otherwise would be rather passive.\nPolder -\na structure for restraining the sea from lowlands, as in the Netherlands. A metaphor for a pressurized hull, especially for the continuous hull of a modular outpost or settlement containing a mini-biosphere.

What does it matter if you have fresh air that leaks?\nPrimage, Primaging\n- The upper rock powder layer of the Moon's surface, called the regolith blanket, is rich in \"volatile\" elements (hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, the noble gasses, etc.). This is not a resource native to the Moon, but one that has accumulated by billions of years during which the Moon's surface has been buffeted by the Solar Wind blowing outward from the Sun's Corona. These volatile atoms become ad-sorbed to the fine dust particles in the regolith. Experiments with returned moondust samples show that these gasses can be released by heating the soil sample to 600 \u00b0C.\nIf, every time we used a work-vehicle (plow, grader, bull-dozer) to move lunar soil whether for the road building, site-preparation, transformation into agricultural soil, sorting for beneficiation as a preparation for production of building materials, etc., we religiously extracted these volatiles and stored them in tanks, we would go a long way towards lessening dependence for these elements on expensive upports from Earth or shipments from Phobos, Deimos, and various asteroid and comet sources. We have dubbed this process as \"primage\" as it is an operation that must always come first if we are \"to survive and thrive.\"\nThis means that all such soil-moving and soil-handling equipment must have a mobile heater-gas extractor complex in tandem. The extra burden of operating in this fashion pales in significance in comparison with the enormous benefits of doing so.\nTo date, the only other proposal for gas extraction of this kind has been as a byproduct of helium-3 mining.\nPurple\n- paint colors - a shade of purple can be made by mixing cobaltous aluminate (blue) and ferric oxide (rust) -see regolith impressionism\nFor Stained Glass , try combining blues and reds in different ratios\nAB | CD | EF | GH | I\u00a0J | K L | MN | OP | QR | ST | UV | WX | YZ\nQuarantine, natural\n-\u00a0No matter how many lunar settlements there are someday, the vacuum and the lifeless rock powder terrain between them enforces a natural quarantine superior to any on Earth.\nHowever travel an travelers can carry unwanted viruses, bacteria, and parasites. That almost all travel will not involve spacesuits, thanks to vehicle-habitat docking at both ends of any journey through the out-vac, will tend to compromise this isolation. However, one a disease or blight is identified at one location, it will be far easier to prevent air-borne or water-borne spread than it is here on Earth.\nLunar level quarantine can be simulated on Earth with pressurized habitats surrounded by water.\nSee \"Quarantine\" MMM Classics # 6, pp. 29-30\nQuicksilver Fleet\n- Mercury could someday become the \"Grand Central Station\" of the Solar system.

Other publications have been concerned with\r\n    epidemiological guidelines, evaluation of short-term tests for\r\n    carcinogens, biomarkers, effects on the elderly and so forth.\r\n\r\n    Since its inauguration the EHC Programme has widened its scope, and\r\n    the importance of environmental effects, in addition to health\r\n    effects, has been increasingly emphasized in the total evaluation of\r\n    chemicals.\r\n\r\n    The original impetus for the Programme came from World Health Assembly\r\n    resolutions and the recommendations of the 1972 UN Conference on the\r\n    Human Environment.  Subsequently the work became an integral part of\r\n    the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), a cooperative\r\n    programme of UNEP, ILO and WHO.  In this manner, with the strong\r\n    support of the new partners, the importance of occupational health and\r\n    environmental effects was fully recognized. The EHC monographs have\r\n    become widely established, used and recognized throughout the world.\r\n\r\n    The recommendations of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and\r\n    Development and the subsequent establishment of the Intergovernmental\r\n    Forum on Chemical Safety with the priorities for action in the six\r\n    programme areas of Chapter 19, Agenda 21, all lend further weight to\r\n    the need for EHC assessments of the risks of chemicals.\r\n\r\n    Scope\r\n\r\n    The criteria monographs are intended to provide critical reviews on\r\n    the effect on human health and the environment of chemicals and of\r\n    combinations of chemicals and physical and biological agents.  As\r\n    such, they include and review studies that are of direct relevance for\r\n    the evaluation.  However, they do not describe every study carried\r\n    out.  Worldwide data are used and are quoted from original studies,\r\n    not from abstracts or reviews.  Both published and unpublished reports\r\n    are considered and it is incumbent on the authors to assess all the\r\n    articles cited in the references.  Preference is always given to\r\n    published data.  Unpublished data are only used when relevant\r\n    published data are absent or when they are pivotal to the risk\r\n    assessment.  A detailed policy statement is available that describes\r\n    the procedures used for unpublished proprietary data so that this\r\n    information can be used in the evaluation without  compromising its\r\n    confidential nature (WHO (1990) Revised Guidelines for the Preparation\r\n    of Environmental Health Criteria Monographs. PCS/90.69, Geneva, World\r\n    Health Organization).\r\n\r\n    In the evaluation of human health risks, sound human data, whenever\r\n    available, are preferred to animal data.  Animal and in vitro studies provide support and are used mainly to supply evidence missing\r\n    from human studies.  It is mandatory that research on human subjects\r\n    is conducted in full accord with ethical principles, including the\r\n    provisions of the Helsinki Declaration.\r\n\r\n    The EHC monographs are intended to assist national and international\r\n    authorities in making risk assessments and subsequent risk management\r\n    decisions.  They represent a thorough evaluation of risks and are not,\r\n    in any sense, recommendations for regulation or standard setting. \r\n    These latter are the exclusive purview of national and regional\r\n    governments.\r\n\r\n    Content\r\n\r\n    The layout of EHC monographs for chemicals is outlined below.\r\n\r\n    *    Summary -- a review of the salient facts and the risk evaluation\r\n         of the chemical\r\n    *    Identity -- physical and chemical properties, analytical methods\r\n    *    Sources of exposure\r\n    *    Environmental transport, distribution and transformation\r\n    *    Environmental levels and human exposure\r\n    *    Kinetics and metabolism in laboratory animals and humans\r\n    *    Effects on laboratory mammals and in vitro test systems\r\n    *    Effects on humans\r\n    *    Effects on other organisms in the laboratory and field\r\n    *    Evaluation of human health risks and effects on the environment\r\n    *    Conclusions and recommendations for protection of human health\r\n         and the environment\r\n\r\n    *    Further research\r\n    *    Previous evaluations by international bodies, e.g., IARC, JECFA,\r\n         JMPR\r\n\r\n    Selection of chemicals\r\n\r\n    Since the inception of the EHC Programme, the IPCS has organized\r\n    meetings of scientists to establish lists of priority chemicals for\r\n    subsequent evaluation.  Such meetings have been held in: Ispra, Italy,\r\n    1980; Oxford, United Kingdom, 1984; Berlin, Germany, 1987; and North\r\n    Carolina, USA, 1995. The selection of chemicals has been based on the\r\n    following criteria: the existence of scientific evidence that the\r\n    substance presents a hazard to human health and/or the environment;\r\n    the possible use, persistence, accumulation or degradation of the\r\n    substance shows that there may be significant human or environmental\r\n    exposure; the size and nature of populations at risk (both human and\r\n    other species) and risks for environment; international concern, i.e.\r\n    the substance is of major interest to several countries; adequate data\r\n    on the hazards are available.\r\n\r\n    If an EHC monograph is proposed for a chemical not on the priority\r\n    list, the IPCS Secretariat consults with the Cooperating Organizations\r\n    and all the Participating Institutions before embarking on the\r\n    preparation of the monograph.\r\n\r\n    Procedures\r\n\r\n    The order of procedures that result in the publication of an EHC\r\n    monograph is shown in the flow chart.  A designated staff member of\r\n    IPCS, responsible for the scientific quality of the document, serves\r\n    as Responsible Officer (RO).  The IPCS Editor is responsible for\r\n    layout and language.  The first draft, prepared by consultants or,\r\n    more usually, staff from an IPCS Participating Institution, is based\r\n    initially on data provided from the International Register of\r\n    Potentially Toxic Chemicals, and reference data bases such as Medline\r\n    and Toxline.\r\n\r\n    The draft document, when received by the RO, may require an initial\r\n    review by a small panel of experts to determine its scientific quality\r\n    and objectivity.  Once the RO finds the document acceptable as a first\r\n    draft, it is distributed, in its unedited form, to well over 150 EHC\r\n    contact points throughout the world who are asked to comment on its\r\n    completeness and accuracy and, where necessary, provide additional\r\n    material.  The contact points, usually designated by governments, may\r\n    be Participating Institutions, IPCS Focal Points, or individual\r\n    scientists known for their particular expertise.  Generally some four\r\n    months are allowed before the comments are considered by the RO and\r\n    author(s).  A second draft incorporating comments received and\r\n    approved by the  Director, IPCS, is then  distributed to Task Group\r\n    members, who carry out the peer review, at least six weeks before\r\n    their meeting.\r\n\r\n    The Task Group members serve as individual scientists, not as\r\n    representatives of any organization, government or industry.  Their\r\n    function is to evaluate the accuracy, significance and relevance of\r\n    the information in the document and to assess the health and\r\n    environmental risks from exposure to the chemical.  A summary and\r\n    recommendations for further research and improved safety aspects are\r\n    also required.  The composition of the Task Group is dictated by the \r\n    range of expertise required for the subject of the meeting and by the \r\n    need for a balanced geographical distribution.\r\n\r\n    The three cooperating organizations of the IPCS recognize the\r\n    important role played by nongovernmental organizations.\r\n    Representatives from relevant national and international associations\r\n    may be invited to join the Task Group as observers.  While observers\r\n    may provide a valuable contribution to the process, they can only\r\n    speak at the invitation of the Chairperson. Observers do not\r\n    participate in the final evaluation of the chemical; this is the sole\r\n    responsibility of the Task Group members.  When the Task Group\r\n    considers it to be appropriate, it may meet in camera.\r\n\r\n    All individuals who as authors, consultants or advisers participate in\r\n    the preparation of the EHC monograph must, in addition to serving in\r\n    their personal capacity as scientists, inform the RO if at any time a\r\n    conflict of interest, whether actual or potential, could be perceived\r\n    in their work.  They are required to sign a conflict of interest\r\n    statement. Such a procedure ensures the transparency and probity of\r\n    the process.\r\n\r\n    When the Task Group has completed its review and the RO is satisfied\r\n    as to the scientific correctness and completeness of the document, it\r\n    then goes for language editing, reference checking, and preparation of\r\n    camera-ready copy.  After approval by the Director, IPCS, the\r\n    monograph is submitted to the WHO Office of Publications for printing. \r\n    At this time a copy of the final draft is sent to the Chairperson and\r\n    Rapporteur of the Task Group to check for any errors.\r\n\r\n    It is accepted that the following criteria should initiate the\r\n    updating of an EHC monograph: new data are available that would\r\n    substantially change the evaluation; there is public concern for\r\n    health or environmental effects of the agent because of greater\r\n    exposure; an appreciable time period has elapsed since the last\r\n    evaluation.\r\n\r\n    All Participating Institutions are informed, through the EHC progress\r\n    report, of the authors and institutions proposed for the drafting of\r\n    the documents.  A comprehensive file of all comments received on\r\n    drafts of each EHC monograph is maintained and is available on\r\n    request.  The Chairpersons of Task Groups are briefed before each\r\n    meeting on their role and responsibility in ensuring that these rules\r\n    are followed.\nWHO WORKING GROUP ON HEALTH RISKS FROM THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF TOBACCO\r\n    SMOKING AND EXPOSURE TO OTHER CHEMICALS\r\n\r\n    (Geneva, 25-26 April 1966) Members Dr G.

OVERVIEW 1.1  Introduction Tobacco use, particularly smoking, causes a range of adverse health\r\n    effects, is directly implicated in a number of serious diseases, and\r\n    can increase adverse effects of other chemical, physical and\r\n    biological agents. Chemicals and other agents in workplaces can cause,\r\n    if not controlled, disease, incapacity and early death. In the\r\n    workplace it is clear that adverse effects can be produced by the\r\n    synergistic interaction of tobacco smoking and other hazards. The\r\n    majority of interactions of harmful tobacco smoke constituents with\r\n    toxic chemicals occur when the latter are airborne, although\r\n    interactions of smoking with ingested and/or absorbed harmful agents\r\n    have also been reported.\r\n\r\n    Tobacco use is widespread throughout the world, from countries with\r\n    low income economies to the most affluent industrialized nations.\r\n    Tobacco is used by men and women, by children and adults, and millions\r\n    of people are involuntarily subjected to environmental tobacco smoke.\r\n    There are numerous explanations for the tobacco habit but the main\r\n    reason for its ubiquity is the addictive drug nicotine present in all\r\n    forms of tobacco leaf and delivered in varying amounts to the user by\r\n    the various methods of tobacco use (chapter 2). The advent of the\r\n    cigarette, mass produced, easily obtainable, relatively cheap and\r\n    light in weight, so it can be held in the mouth leaving the hands\r\n    free, has had a major impact on smoking habits, in general and in\r\n    workplaces.\r\n\r\n    In many countries tobacco smoking is recognized as a serious health\r\n    hazard and a major contributing factor to deaths from a number of\r\n    common diseases. In these countries health warning legislation and\r\n    measures to control consumption by taxation have been implemented, as\r\n    well as public education programmes on the dangers of smoking and the\r\n    benefits to be gained from not starting or from stopping. However,\r\n    there are still countries where decisive action has yet to be taken to\r\n    deal with the problem of tobacco use.\r\n\r\n    Many work situations involve an element of risk. The nature of the\r\n    work may generate harmful effects on health, and working activities\r\n    may cause environmental contamination. Tobacco growing itself involves\r\n    the use of pesticides, harvesting of tobacco leaf can cause sickness\r\n    due to skin absorption of nicotine, and processing exposes workers to\r\n    health hazards from airborne dust and fungal spores. A high male\r\n    cancer incidence has been reported in areas with tobacco industries.\r\n    In mining there are airborne mineral dusts and, in farming and\r\n    industries using biologically produced raw materials, biological dusts\r\n    are found. Fumes are produced during welding, and gases, smokes, mists\r\n    and vapours containing inorganic and/or organic toxic substances\r\n    present hazards in many industries. Excessive heat or exposure to\r\n    ultraviolet light can be detrimental to the well-being of workers.\r\n    Ionizing radiation in mining and modern technology is recognized as a\r\n    workplace hazard. In many occupations workers are subjected to\r\n\r\n    excessive noise or harmful mechanical vibration. Working conditions\r\n    can impact adversely on health to a greater extent in smokers than\r\n    non-smokers. In many countries, smoking at the workplace is \r\n    prohibited, primarily for reasons of fire/explosion safety. However, \r\n    in some countries, regulations are not always enforced. In some newly \r\n    industrializing countries health problems associated with work have \r\n    not yet been fully addressed and many employers and workers are \r\n    ignorant of the dangers to health of their occupations. In addition, \r\n    there is the large \"informal sector\" of industry, particularly in \r\n    developing countries, where the home is the workplace, chemicals are \r\n    used (including solvents, resins, and synthetic dyestuffs), the whole \r\n    family is exposed, and there are no restrictions on exposure to work\r\n    hazards or smoking.\r\n\r\n    The situation for adverse health effects resulting from combined\r\n    exposure to tobacco smoke, mainstream or environmental, and agents in\r\n    the domestic environment is much less defined. However, the incidence\r\n    of lung cancer and the concentration of radon in homes has a similar\r\n    dose-response to lung cancer and radon in mines, and the risk is\r\n    higher in smokers. 1.2  Examples of combined effects of tobacco smoking and other\r\n         exposures There is evidence for synergism in the production of adverse effects\r\n    (cancer) between tobacco smoking and exposure to arsenic, asbestos,\r\n    ethanol, silica and radiation (radon, atomic bomb, X-ray). On the\r\n    other hand there is evidence for antagonism in the case of tobacco\r\n    smoking and the carcinogenic chloromethyl ethers, i.e. chloromethyl\r\n    methyl ether (CMME) and bis(chloromethyl) ether (BCME) (Hoffmann &\r\n    Wynder, 1976; IARC, 1986), tobacco smoking and allergic alveolitis,\r\n    and tobacco smoking and chronic beryllium disease. Tobacco smoking\r\n    affects the health risks of exposures in coal mining, pesticide\r\n    handling, and in the rubber and petroleum industries. Coal miners who\r\n    smoke are at greater risk of developing chronic bronchitis and\r\n    obstructive airway disease but not emphysema. Lung cancer in coal\r\n    miners has been attributed entirely to tobacco smoking. Tobacco\r\n    smoking can increase the health risks of exposure to vegetable dusts\r\n    that produce chronic respiratory conditions, such as byssinosis\r\n    produced by cotton dust, and nasal cancer caused by wood dusts. 1.3  Composition of tobacco leaf and tobacco smoke More than 3040 chemical compounds have been isolated from processed\r\n    tobacco leaf (Roberts, 1988). Most are leaf constituents, but some\r\n    arise from growing conditions such as the soil and atmosphere in an\r\n    area, while others originate from the use of agricultural chemicals,\r\n    from casings, humectants and flavourings added to the leaves, and from\r\n    curing methods. Different tobacco varieties grown in different\r\n    countries, and cured and processed in various ways show differences.\r\n    The proportions of individual constituents may differ but not the\r\n    overall composition. Among important toxic compounds identified, other\r\n    than nicotine, are carcinogenic nitrosamines, derived from nitrites,\r\n\r\n    amines, proteins and alkaloids present in the leaf, polycyclic\r\n    aromatic hydrocarbons resulting from the curing process, radioactive\r\n    elements absorbed from the soil and the air, and cadmium in tobacco\r\n    grown on cadmium-rich soils. When tobacco is burned in the course of\r\n    smoking, many pyrolysis and other reaction products are formed. 1.4  Mainstream tobacco smoke Tobacco smoke is an aerosol consisting of a particulate phase of\r\n    liquid droplets dispersed in a gas/vapour phase. When a cigarette is\r\n    smoked, many compounds are formed by pyrolysis of the tobacco. These\r\n    either pass through the cigarette as mainstream smoke, some being\r\n    condensed a short distance behind the burning cone, or they are\r\n    emitted into the air from the burning end as sidestream smoke. With\r\n    each puff the smoke becomes progressively stronger because previously\r\n    condensed material is added to the smoke and the length of cigarette\r\n    available for further condensation is decreasing. The physicochemical\r\n    nature of the smoke depends on the processing and burning of the\r\n    tobacco, the porosity and treatment of the paper wrapper, and on the\r\n    type of filter tip (Hoffmann & Hoffmann, 1997). In the case of a\r\n    cigarette or Asian \"bidi\" (tobacco wrapped in vegetable leaf), the\r\n    smoke chemistry is affected by such factors as dimensions, wrapper\r\n    porosity and the smoking parameters of puff volume, frequency and\r\n    duration (NIH, 1998). Variations in smoke chemistry are mainly in the\r\n    balance of smoke constituents rather than the presence or absence of\r\n    particular compounds.\r\n\r\n    Mainstream smoke is generated in a comparatively low-oxygen atmosphere\r\n    at a burning temperature of 850-950\u00b0C in the fire cone. Initially,\r\n    mainstream smoke particles have a mass median aerodynamic diameter\r\n    (MMAD) of 0.2 to 0.3 \u00b5m; however, as soon as they encounter the 100%\r\n    humidity of the respiratory tract, they coalesce into larger particles\r\n    and behave as if their MMAD was in the micrometre range. Between 50\r\n    and 90% of all inhaled particulate matter may be retained in the\r\n    respiratory tract (Wynder & Hoffmann, 1967; Hinds et al., 1983). From\r\n    size considerations, the aerosol particulate matter, the vapour phase\r\n    constituents and the permanent gases are capable of reaching the\r\n    alveoli when smoke is inhaled. Deposition in the tracheobronchial tree\r\n    is complicated by the behaviour of hydrophilic constituents in the\r\n    high humidity conditions, but smoke reaches every part of the airways.\r\n\r\n    Mainstream smoke contains nearly 4000 identified chemicals and an\r\n    unknown number of unidentified chemicals (Roberts, 1988). Mainstream\r\n    smoke can be divided into particulate and gas phases. Mainstream smoke\r\n    particulate phase contains nicotine, nitrosamines such as\r\n    4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), metals such as cadmium, nickel, zinc and\r\n    polonium-210, polycyclic hydrocarbons, and carcinogenic amines, such\r\n    as 4-aminobiphenyl. The vapour phase contains carbon monoxide, carbon\r\n    dioxide, benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine and other compounds.\r\n    Compounds in tobacco smoke can be classified by their biological\r\n    activity as asphyxiants, irritants, ciliatoxins, mutagens,\r\n\r\n    carcinogens, enzyme inhibitors, neurotoxins or pharmacologically\r\n    active compounds. The main point of entry of cigarette smoke into the\r\n    body is via the airways, but many constituents, particularly from pipe\r\n    and cigar smoke, dissolve in saliva and are absorbed in the buccal\r\n    cavity or are swallowed. Cigar and pipe smokers generally do not\r\n    inhale the smoke and it remains in the oral cavity, is dissolved in\r\n    the saliva and absorbed through the mucous membranes or swallowed\r\n    (NIH, 1998). Alcoholic drinks have a solvent effect for the smoke\r\n    constituents facilitating their absorption. 1.5  Sidestream tobacco smoke Sidestream smoke is generated at lower burning temperature (500-600\u00b0C)\r\n    in a reducing atmosphere. Fresh sidestream smoke particles are about\r\n    the same size as mainstream smoke particles with a mass median\r\n    aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of approximately 0.2 \u00b5m. Qualitatively,\r\n    sidestream smoke composition is similar to the composition of\r\n    mainstream smoke. Some chemicals in sidestream smoke are emitted at\r\n    higher concentrations per gram of tobacco burned than in mainstream\r\n    smoke. This is particularly so for carcinogens such as N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethyl-amine, and for metals\r\n    such as nickel or cadmium. Many carcinogenic compounds are more\r\n    concentrated in sidestream than in mainstream smoke. Mouse\r\n    skin-painting bioassays have shown that condensate of sidestream smoke\r\n    is more carcinogenic than that of mainstream smoke (Wynder & Hoffmann,\r\n    1967; US Surgeon General, 1986; NIH, 1998). 1.6  Effects of ways of cigarette smoking on smoke toxicity The nicotine content of different cigarettes varies, and the smoker\r\n    adjusts the smoking intensity and depth of inhalation to satisfy the\r\n    acquired nicotine need. Consequently, the smoker of a filter cigarette\r\n    with a low nicotine yield (&lt1.2 mg) smokes more intensively and this\r\n    influences toxicity (NIH, 1998). 1.7  Summary of conclusions and recommendations Tobacco use, particularly smoking, is a most important public health\r\n    hazard and a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. In\r\n    addition to the adverse health effects of active tobacco use, adverse\r\n    health effects have been demonstrated to result from exposure to\r\n    environmental tobacco smoke. The risks from tobacco smoking are also\r\n    increased through interactions with certain chemical, physical and\r\n    biological hazards found in the workplace and general environment.\r\n    There are a few instances of antagonistic interactions, but the health\r\n    risks of tobacco smoke far outweigh any apparent protective effects.\r\n\r\n    All possible measures should be taken to eliminate tobacco use,\r\n    particularly smoking, and smoking in public places should be strongly\r\n    discouraged. To avoid interaction with occupational exposures and to\r\n    eliminate the risk of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking\r\n    in the workplace should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n    To protect health, in particular that of children, smoking in domestic\r\n    environments should be strongly discouraged. This will prevent\r\n    possible harmful interactions between tobacco smoke and residential\r\n    exposures to other hazards. There is a pressing need for educational\r\n    programmes on the health hazards of smoking. Health professionals\r\n    should provide assistance to help smokers quit. Since smoking may\r\n    result in altered response or adverse reactions to drugs and other\r\n    treatments, appropriate dose adjustments and patient surveillance\r\n    should be taken into consideration by clinicians. 2.  EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND HEALTH RISKS FROM TOBACCO USE 2.1  Tobacco and its uses 2.1.1  Introduction\r\n\r\n    The genus Nicotiana, a member of the plant family Solanaceae, is\r\n    represented by about 100 species and sub-species (Cromwell, 1955; Tso,\r\n    1990) widely distributed throughout the world. The species N. tabacum and N. rustica are the principal sources of tobacco. The\r\n    primary intention in using tobacco is to obtain the alkaloid nicotine\r\n    and, once the habit has been established, nicotine appears to fulfil\r\n    both a pharmacological and psychological need (US Surgeon General,\r\n    1988; NIH, 1998).\r\n\r\n    Tobacco and its uses were unknown outside America before its discovery\r\n    by Columbus. In a description of tobacco use in South America at that\r\n    period, Wilbert (1987) used information from European explorers.\r\n\r\n    There were six types of tobacco use: chewing, drinking, licking,\r\n    rectal insertion, nasal and oral snuffing, and smoking. Smoking was by\r\n    far the most common, while rectal application was only used\r\n    occasionally. Tobacco smoke was inhaled via the mouth through tubes or\r\n    rolls of tobacco leaf, or through the nostrils using a Y-shaped tube.\r\n    Alternatively, it was swallowed and belched back, blown from one\r\n    person to another, or blown into the eyes. Leaves were chewed, alone\r\n    or mixed with ash, powdered shells or honey, or they were held in the\r\n    mouth and sucked. Infusions were drunk or a concentrated infusion was\r\n    licked or even used as an enema. Many ways of preparing and taking\r\n    snuff among different tribes were reported. Tobacco use was linked to\r\n    religious rituals.\r\n\r\n    The rest of the world adopted tobacco use in the forms of smoking,\r\n    chewing and snuffing. Smoking has remained the most popular. Tobacco\r\n    smoking consists of burning the cured leaf, perhaps mixed with\r\n    fragrant additives, in a pipe or tube. Cigarette smoking has largely\r\n    replaced other methods in many countries. Reasons for the popularity\r\n    of cigarettes include their ready availability resulting from\r\n    large-scale manufacture and their greater convenience over other forms\r\n    of tobacco use (IARC, 1986). In developed countries, cigarettes\r\n    account for at least 80% of overall tobacco consumption, but in most\r\n    developing countries other ways of using tobacco predominate, although\r\n    cigarette smoking is increasing. Fig. 1 shows estimated daily\r\n    cigarette consumption on a regional basis, Tables 1 and 2 show daily\r\n    smoking prevalences on a regional and national basis and Table 3 shows\r\n    trends in cigarette consumption.\n2.1.2  Tobacco smoking\r\n\r\n    Smoking prevalence data and most studies into the effects of smoking\r\n    have concentrated on cigarette smoking, yet worldwide only about 55%\r\n    of tobacco is used for cigarettes. The rest, along with significant\r\n    amounts traded in \"farm gate\" and \"local market\" sales or \"home\r\n    grown\", is smoked in \"bidis\" or other hand-rolled devices, or in some\r\n    form of pipe (IARC, 1986). Tobacco consumption data give an insight\r\n    into tobacco-related disease distribution, as can information on ways\r\n    of smoking.\r\n\r\n    Table 1.

Curing removes moisture so that the leaf can be\r\n    stored without fermenting or rotting, and the time and temperature of\r\n    curing influences enzyme reactions such as deamination and oxidation,\r\n    and the content of oils and resins. Air-, flue-, sun-, and fire-curing\r\n    methods are employed and each produces distinctive tobaccos which are\r\n    intended for smoking in a specific way or to suit a particular\r\n    preference.\r\n\r\n    Between 1933 and the late 1940s, the yields from an average cigarette\r\n    varied from 33 to 49 mg tar and from < 1 to 3 mg nicotine (Creek et\r\n    al., 1994). However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the average yield from\r\n    cigarettes in Western Europe and the USA was around 16 mg tar and 1.5\r\n\r\n    mg nicotine per cigarette. Current average levels are lower. Changes\r\n    in the levels of tar and nicotine have resulted in the characteristic\r\n    more intense puffing and smoke inhalation pattern of smokers of\r\n    low-yield cigarettes (Djordjevic et al., 1995; NIH, 1996). The \r\n    high tar yields measured in the smoke of cigarettes in developed\r\n    countries before 1950 are comparable with current tar yields of\r\n    \"bidis\", which range from 23 to 48 mg per cigarette (Hoffmann et al.,\r\n    1974; Jayant & Pakhale, 1985; Ball & Simpson, 1987.) The \"kretek\" (a\r\n    cigarette of strong tobacco and cloves) of Indonesia yields up to\r\n    71 mg tar (WHO, 1985). Smoking materials in northern Thailand\r\n    (cigarette or cigar of strong tobacco plus various vegetable\r\n    materials) produce high levels of tar and nicotine (Simarak et al.,\r\n    1977).\r\n\r\n    For smoking, tobacco leaf can be flue-cured, light air-cured,\r\n    fire-cured or sun-cured, and can be of dark, oriental or N. rustica type. Flue-cured tobacco is used for cigarettes and pipe tobacco.\r\n    Air-cured tobacco is used in blended cigarettes. Dark tobaccos are\r\n    widely grown, usually air-cured, and mostly used in their countries of\r\n    origin for dark cigarettes, \"bidis\", cigars, in pipes and \"sheeshas\",\r\n    and for chewing tobaccos and snuff (Voges, 1984). Some tobaccos have\r\n    low nitrate levels ranging up to 0.9% (Neurath & Ehmke, 1964; Wynder &\r\n    Hoffmann, 1967) and their smoke contains low nitrogen oxide levels in\r\n    the range of 50-200 mg NOx/cigarette (Norman et al., 1983). In the\r\n    reducing atmosphere of the burning cone, NOx gives rise to amino\r\n    radicals, which react with benzene, biphenyl, naphthalene and other\r\n    ring hydrocarbons to form aromatic amines. Aniline, alkylated\r\n    anilines, aminobiphenyls, and naphthylamines are therefore found in\r\n    higher quantities in the smoke of tobaccos with a high nitrate content\r\n    (Patrianakos & Hoffmann, 1979; Pieraccini et al., 1992; Grimmer et\r\n    al., 1995). Smokers of these tobaccos can inhale greater quantities of\r\n    aromatic amines, such as the human bladder carcinogens\r\n    2-naphthyl-amine and 4-aminobiphenyl, and have higher concentrations\r\n    of haemoglobin adducts in their blood (Bartsch et al., 1993). This is\r\n    the basis for the higher risk of bladder cancer among the smokers of\r\n    cigarettes made from dark tobaccos (Vineis et al., 1984; D'Avanzo et\r\n    al., 1990; Vineis, 1992).\r\n\r\n    In the Indian subcontinent, the \"bidi\" is the common smoking device.\r\n    It consists of tobacco flakes, loosely packed and hand-rolled in a\r\n    tendu or temburni leaf ( Diospyros melanoxylon). It contains less\r\n    tobacco (0.223 g) than a cigarette (0.782 g) (Ramakrishnan et al.,\r\n    1995) but up to 8.2% nicotine compared with up to 3.7% in cigarette\r\n    tobacco. \"Bidi\" smoke contains 23 to 48 mg tar and 1.7 to 2.9 mg\r\n    nicotine per cigarette (Hoffmann et al., 1974; Jayant & Pakhale,\r\n    1985). In India, where around 7% of world tobacco is consumed (US DA,\r\n    1990), around 30% of tobacco is smoked as cigarettes, 50% as \"bidis\",\r\n    10% in other ways, and 10% is used for chewing. \"Bidis\" need to be\r\n    puffed frequently to ensure even burning and can generate up to 70 mg\r\n    of carbon monoxide, while a US non-filter cigarette smoked under\r\n    identical conditions generated 25 mg carbon monoxide (Hoffmann et al.,\r\n    1974; Jayant & Pakhale, 1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n        Table 2.

Indonesian cigarette smoke contains up to 100 ng\r\n    of carcinogenic volatile N-nitrosamines and up to 1580 ng of\r\n    carcinogenic tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (Mitacek et al., 1990,\r\n    1991), and high tar cigarettes contain up to 28.1 mg tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines per cigarette (Brunnemann et al., 1996).\r\n\r\n    Many cigar-like devices are smoked throughout Asia. The tobacco can be\r\n    rolled in a tobacco leaf or in the leaves of the jackfruit tree\r\n    ( Artocarpus integrifolia), banana ( Musa paradisiaca) or hansali\r\n    ( Grewia microcos) (Bhonsle et al., 1976). They may be smoked\r\n    conventionally or in the reverse manner with the burning end inside\r\n    the mouth (Reddy, 1974). In Thailand they can contain strong tobacco\r\n    and a mixture of koi bark ( Streblus asper), dry tamarind pod\r\n    ( Tamarindus indica), khai bark ( Homonoia riparia, Euphorbiaceae),\r\n    Areca palm bark ( Areca catechu) or other tree bark; they can be\r\n    rolled in a banana leaf or have fragrant additives such as sandalwood\r\n    Mougne et al. (1982). They contain high levels of tar and nicotine\r\n    (Simarak et al., 1977; Mitacek et al., 1999).\r\n\r\n    Additives are used to enhance the fragrance or taste of smoke\r\n    (Hoffmann & Hoffmann, 1997). \"Casing sauces\", consisting of sugars,\r\n    aromatic substances and compounds such as glycerol, propylene glycol,\r\n    ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, which resist changes in\r\n    moisture content, are sprayed on the leaf before it is cut to\r\n    condition it for processing. Flavouring and dressing compounds are\r\n    added to cut tobacco after drying and include licorice, menthol,\r\n    cocoa, chocolate, ginger, cinnamon, vanilla, molasses, angelica,\r\n    honey, essential oils from anise, clove and juniper, resins and plant\r\n    extracts and organic compounds such as coumarins. Additives have been\r\n    widely used in pipe and chewing tobaccos. They have also become\r\n    important in cigarette tobacco with the development of low-tar and\r\n    low-nicotine tobaccos and the use of stem, midrib or reconstituted\r\n    leaf (which lacks the aromas and flavours of natural tobacco leaf\r\n    lamina) and of tobacco dust requiring additives to ensure its\r\n    adherence to cut tobacco.\r\n\r\n    Added glycerol is transferred to mainstream smoke: 3-6% in cigarette\r\n    smoke and 35-43% in pipe smoke (IARC, 1986) and one of its pyrolysis\r\n    products is acrolein. Levels of acrolein ranging from 69 mg to 230 mg\r\n    per cigarette have been reported and air concentrations as high as\r\n    0.46 mg/m3 have been found in smoke-filled rooms (Izard & Liberman,\r\n    1978). Acrolein is extremely irritating to the eyes and nasal mucosa,\r\n    it affects mitotic and ciliary activity, at the cellular level it has\r\n    cytotoxic and cilia-depressant effects, and it can act as a mutagen\r\n    (Izard & Liberman, 1978).\r\n\r\n    In the USA, additives used in cigarette manufacture are food additive\r\n    compounds that are \"generally recognized as safe (GRAS)\" and,\r\n    therefore, also considered \"safe\" as additives to tobacco. However,\r\n    the non-volatile additives are to some extent pyrolized during smoking\r\n    and can give rise to toxic and/or carcinogenic agents in the smoke. A\r\n    major group of compounds formed during pyrolysis is that of the\r\n    polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Ethylene glycol is pyrolytically\r\n    converted to the human carcinogen ethylene oxide (IARC, 1994a).\r\n\r\n    Another example of carcinogen formation during tobacco curing and\r\n    smoking is the case of MH-30, a sucker growth control agent formulated\r\n    from maleic hydrazide in diethanolamine. Residual MH-30 on tobacco\r\n    leads to the formation of N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) in the\r\n    smoke (Brunnemann & Hoffmann, 1981). The use of MH-30 on tobacco has\r\n    been forbidden in the USA since 1981, and NDELA levels in tobacco and\r\n    its smoke have declined (Brunnemann & Hoffmann, 1991).\r\n\r\n    The use of cloves as a tobacco additive can have health effects. In\r\n    Indonesia, the smoke of \"kreteks\", a blend of ground cloves with \r\n    60-65% of tobacco, contains between 41 and 113 mg of tar, and between \r\n    1.2 and 4.5 mg nicotine (WHO, 1985; Wise & Guerin, 1986). Mainstream \r\n    smoke of kreteks without filter tips contains 19-23 mg of eugenol \r\n    released from the cloves, while filter-tipped kretek smoke contains up\r\n    to 15 mg (LGC, 1982; Wise & Guerin, 1986). Inhalation of eugenol in \r\n    the smoke of kreteks can lead to interstitial haemorrhaging and \r\n    congestion of the lung, acute emphysema and acute pulmonary oedema. \r\n    These effects were also seen in Syrian golden hamsters exposed to the\r\n    smoke of kreteks (LaVoie et al., 1986).\r\n\r\n    Menthol and other additives that produce a sensation of coolness but\r\n    without a mint flavour have also been used in cigarettes. There is no\r\n    evidence that these additives result in a higher risk (Cummings et\r\n    al., 1987; Sidney et al., 1989).\r\n\r\n    Many shapes and sizes of smoking pipes are found worldwide (Voges,\r\n    1984). Various types of tobacco are used and the smoke can range from\r\n    mild to very strong. In the sheesha water pipe the tobacco is kept\r\n    alight by pieces of glowing charcoal and the smoke is drawn through\r\n    water before being inhaled. Sheesha smoke is mild and low in\r\n    particulate matter, benzo( a) pyrene and volatile phenols (Hoffmann\r\n    et al., 1961), but it has a high level of carbon monoxide, in part\r\n    from the charcoal that keeps the tobacco burning, and smokers have\r\n    high carboxyhaemoglobin levels and a reduced FEV1 (8.5% in women, 45%\r\n    in men) (Zahran et al., 1985; Al-Fayez et al., 1988). 2.1.3  Tobacco chewing and snuff\r\n\r\n    The popularity of tobacco chewing and snuff (finely powdered tobacco\r\n    leaf) has varied. Nasal inhalation of snuff has given way to the oral\r\n    application of snuff and other tobacco-containing mixtures between the\r\n    gum and lip, or gum and cheeks, or under the tongue. Chewing tobacco\r\n    comes in several forms and may have flavour added from syrups,\r\n    liquorice and brandy. Tobacco chewing has retained its popularity in\r\n\r\n    heavy industries, such as steel and coal mining, woodworking and the\r\n    petroleum industry, where the flammability hazard precludes smoking.\r\n    In Sweden, 17% of the population uses oral snuff. In the USA, sales of\r\n    chewing tobacco have declined but sales of oral snuff have increased\r\n    by 61% (US DA, 1997) owing to the popularity of the latter with\r\n    teenagers and young adult men. Oral tobacco use in India is very\r\n    common but, generally, in developing countries it is declining because\r\n    urban populations and younger age groups are smoking cigarettes.\r\n\r\n    \"Betel-quid\" chewing is common in Asia and Africa. The basic contents\r\n    of a betel-quid are slices of areca nut ( Areca catechu), lime and\r\n    tobacco, wrapped in a betel pepper leaf ( Piper betle), but it may\r\n    also contain dried dates, menthol and spices such as cardamom, cloves,\r\n    coriander, mace and cinnamon.\r\n\r\n    Other tobacco preparations for oral use often contain lime, calcium\r\n    carbonate, sodium carbonate, some form of ash or flavouring materials.\r\n    The lime and other agents assist the release of nicotine (Voges, 1984;\r\n    Idris et al., 1991). 2.2  Responses to mainstream smoke Tobacco use has direct effects on health and is responsible for a\r\n    variety of diseases. These form a basis for studying interactions\r\n    between tobacco use and chemical, physical and biological agents, and\r\n    associated effects on health. 2.2.1  Acute responses\r\n\r\n    Inhaled irritant chemicals cause inflammation of the upper respiratory\r\n    tract (URT) and paranasal sinuses, sore throat and bronchial oedema.\r\n    Pulmonary oedema may follow if irritants penetrate the lower\r\n    respiratory tract. Acute irritation of the URT usually follows\r\n    inhalation of highly soluble gases. Slightly less soluble gases cause\r\n    URT and bronchial irritation, while relatively insoluble gases\r\n    penetrate deeply into the lung and can have delayed effects including\r\n    pulmonary oedema (Miller & Kimbell, 1995). Cigarette smoke is a\r\n    complex mixture of organic and inorganic constituents with particulate\r\n    and vapour phases and highly reactive free radicals (Hocking & Golde,\r\n    1979). It contains many compounds with irritant properties, which can\r\n    affect all parts of the lung. Kremer et al. (1994) examined the\r\n    association between occupational exposures to a variety of airway\r\n    irritants and respiratory system effects, and whether the association\r\n    was modified by smoking, airway hyperresponsiveness and allergy. The\r\n    irritants were SO2, HCl, SO42-, polyester vapour, polyamide vapour,\r\n    and oil mist and vapour. Current smoking, airway hyperresponsiveness\r\n    and allergy were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of\r\n    chronic respiratory symptoms, independent of each other and of\r\n    irritant exposure. The association between exposure and the prevalence\r\n    of chronic respiratory symptoms was greater in smokers than in non- or\r\n    ex-smokers.\r\n\r\n    2.2.1.1  Acute bronchitis\r\n\r\n    Acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial mucous membrane,\r\n    initially accompanied by a dry painful cough and followed by\r\n    mucopurulent sputum. The cause may be infectious agents or chemical\r\n    agents such as tobacco smoke, dusts, fumes, vapours or gases.\r\n\r\n    2.2.1.2  Asthma\r\n\r\n    Asthma is a chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease associated with\r\n    bronchial hyperreactivity causing paroxysmal dyspnoea due to spasm of\r\n    the bronchial musculature, swelling of the mucous membranes and the\r\n    production of viscid mucus. In the majority of asthma cases a clear\r\n    association exists with atopic IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Allergic\r\n    asthma is a response to a specific agent. Many chemical agents,\r\n    including mixtures such as tobacco smoke, can induce asthma. Smoking\r\n    enhances the effect of other agents and can reduce the latent period\r\n    from first exposure to onset of sensitization.\r\n\r\n    There has been an increase in the prevalence of asthma in many\r\n    countries, and roles for environmental factors, increased\r\n    susceptibility and tobacco smoking have been suggested (ISAAC, 1998).\r\n    Cigarette smoking together, with atopic status, age, URT infection and\r\n    genetic factors, has been considered to increase susceptibility\r\n    (Venables et al., 1985; Seaton et al., 1993). Studies have shown a\r\n    relationship between cigarette smoking and serum IgE levels. Smokers\r\n    have higher levels of IgE with increasing age, compared to non-smoking\r\n    controls. A relationship has also been observed between IgE level and\r\n    the number of cigarettes smoked (Sherrill et al., 1994). 2.2.2  Chronic responses\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.1  Chronic obstructive lung diseases\r\n\r\n    The chronic obstructive lung diseases (COLD) are chronic bronchitis,\r\n    small airways disease, toxic bronchiolitis obliterans, emphysema and\r\n    fibrosis (Niewoehner et al., 1974; Niewoehner, 1991).\r\n\r\n    These diseases form an important group of pulmonary diseases caused by\r\n    smoking (and by chemical atmospheric pollution) (US Surgeon General,\r\n    1984). In a study by Simecek et al. (1986) of 215 229 adults in a\r\n    region of former-Czechoslovakia, smoking was the most important risk\r\n    factor in COLD. Risks for male non-smokers and light smokers under 30\r\n    years of age were 1.18% and 2.28%, respectively; for men aged 50\r\n    years, smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day, the risk was 20.36%\r\n    compared with 3.31% for non-smokers of the same age. In the USA, \r\n    80-90% of the mortality from COLD has been attributed to cigarette\r\n    smoking. Cigar and pipe smokers who inhale the smoke also have an\r\n    increased death rate from COLD (US Surgeon General, 1984, 1989; NIH,\r\n    1998). Between 1979 and 1993, the age-adjusted annual death rate from\r\n\r\n    COLD in women increased by 122% to 17.1 per 100 000, while in men it\r\n    increased by 14% to 27.8 per 100 000. The greater increase of COLD\r\n    among women during this period reflected the increase in smoking by\r\n    women.\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.2  Chronic bronchitis\r\n\r\n    Chronic bronchitis has been variously defined. The United Kingdom\r\n    Medical Research Council (MRC, 1965) considered it to be a condition\r\n    with persistent production of sputum, which might be associated with\r\n    cough, occurring on most days for at least three months in the year\r\n    for at least two successive years. The Council recommended a\r\n    classification of simple chronic bronchitis, chronic or recurrent\r\n    mucopurulent bronchitis or chronic obstructive bronchitis. In a\r\n    workplace context, Morgan (1982) defined it as \"a condition\r\n    characterized by cough and sputum for at least three months of the\r\n    year, which may or may not be accompanied by airways obstruction, and\r\n    which is a consequence of prolonged inhalation of dust or irritant\r\n    gases at the workplace\". Fletcher & Pride (1984) suggested an improved\r\n    terminology with the term chronic bronchitis meaning chronic or\r\n    recurrent bronchial hypersecretion only, abandoning the term chronic\r\n    obstructive bronchitis because this implies a causal connection\r\n    between mucus hypersecretion and airflow obstruction. In smokers'\r\n    lungs the irritant constituents of tobacco smoke cause hypersecretion\r\n    of mucus, alter its physical properties and chemical structure, and\r\n    impair the mucociliary clearance mechanism. Removal of major\r\n    ciliatoxins (hydrogen cyanide and volatile aldehydes) from the smoke\r\n    stream by charcoal filter tips reduces the effects on the lung\r\n    epithelium (Friedman et al., 1972). Mineral dusts, particularly those\r\n    encountered in mining, many biological dusts, irritant vapours and\r\n    gases, inorganic and organic chemical dusts and sprays can all cause\r\n    chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.3  Small airways disease\r\n\r\n    Small airways disease (SAD) is a widespread narrowing of membranous\r\n    bronchioli. It is inflammatory in origin and is often associated with\r\n    excess mucus and an accumulation of macrophages in the respiratory\r\n    bronchioli. SAD is mainly caused by smoking, but can be associated\r\n    with environmental and industrial pollutants (Cosio et al., 1980).\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.4  Emphysema\r\n\r\n    Emphysema has been defined as a condition of the lung characterized by\r\n    an abnormal enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal\r\n    non-respiratory bronchioli, accompanied by destructive changes in the\r\n    alveolar walls, and without obvious fibrosis. It tends to be prevalent\r\n    in older age groups and follows SAD. For purposes of postmortem\r\n    examination of lung slices of miners, Ruckley et al. (1984) defined\r\n    emphysema as the presence of air spaces of 1 mm or more in size.\r\n    Macrophages that have engulfed foreign particles, including smoke\r\n    particulate matter in the lungs of smokers, and which have been found\r\n    accumulated in the bronchioli (Niewoehner et al., 1974) and in the\r\n\r\n    lung parenchyma (McLaughlin & Tueller, 1971) have been implicated in\r\n    the pathogenesis of emphysema. There are different forms of emphysema,\r\n    which vary with the nature of the insult to the tissues. One\r\n    hypothesis is that tobacco smoke causes increased production and\r\n    release of proteolytic enzymes, such as elastase, and interferes with\r\n    normal antiproteolytic mechanisms. Emphysema has been induced\r\n    experimentally in animals by endotracheal installation of elastase or\r\n    homogenates of alveolar macrophages or polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\r\n    Chronic exposure to tobacco smoke has a number of effects on alveolar\r\n    macrophages, including changes in metabolism, alteration of the enzyme\r\n    content and impairment of RNA and protein synthesis (Hocking & Golde,\r\n    1979). The function of alveolar macrophages is to remove inhaled\r\n    foreign material from the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles, and\r\n    their numbers increase when the lungs are exposed to particles and\r\n    gases. It has been demonstrated that the macrophage count is higher in\r\n    people exposed to cigarette smoke than in non-exposed people (Harris\r\n    et al., 1974; Rylander et al., 1979). Alveolar macrophages from\r\n    smokers are more active than those from non-smokers, numbers are\r\n    increased, there are morphological changes with an increased cell\r\n    diameter, crystalline inclusions and surface membrane alteration\r\n    (Sopori et al., 1994).\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.5  Pulmonary fibrosis\r\n\r\n    Pulmonary fibrosis is the abnormal formation of fibrous or scar tissue\r\n    and is the response of bronchiolar tissue to the deposition of an\r\n    inhaled inciting agent. Mineral and other dusts are causes of\r\n    pulmonary fibrosis. The radiological changes seen in early stages of\r\n    dust fibroses are associated with relatively minor lung function\r\n    impairment, but continuous exposure leads to a greater degree of\r\n    fibrosis and to progressive massive fibrosis in some subjects. On\r\n    histological, animal experimental and radiographic evidence, Weiss\r\n    (1984) concluded that cigarette smoking could cause diffuse fibrosis.\r\n\r\n    2.2.2.6  Effects on the immune system\r\n\r\n    Tobacco smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increase\r\n    susceptibility to pulmonary infections, and changes in immune\r\n    processes may be involved. Tobacco smoking affects humoral and\r\n    cellular immunity in humans and experimental animals, but the\r\n    magnitude of the changes vary widely among studies. In humans,\r\n    cigarette smoke has marked effects on alveolar macrophage morphology\r\n    and physiology, it decreases serum immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, IgM) but\r\n    increases IgE, and has a range of effects on B- and T-lymphocytes.\r\n    Similar effects are found in experimental animals (Sopori et al.,\r\n    1994). Studies in rats and mice show that cigarette smoke or nicotine\r\n    induces impaired responses of systemically distributed B- and\r\n    T-lymphocytes to antigen-induced signalling (Geng et al., 1995, 1996).\r\n    T-lymphocyte unresponsiveness, with decreased antibody response to\r\n    T-dependent antigens, is important in response to infection (Sopori et\r\n    al., 1998). 2.2.3  Cancer\r\n\r\n    Many forms of cancer have been associated with inhaled particulate\r\n    matter, vapours, fumes and gases. Examples are lung cancer associated\r\n    with tobacco smoking and inhalation of asbestos, fumes from metal\r\n    moulding and coking plants, particles and gases inhaled by motor\r\n    vehicle drivers, dusts in several types of mines where there is an\r\n    accumulation of alpha-emitting radioisotopes, and contact with\r\n    materials such as arsenic, chromates, nickel, chloromethyl ethers,\r\n    mustard gas and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Pleural mesothelioma\r\n    has been associated with asbestos, nasal and sinus cancer with nickel\r\n    refining and wood dust exposure, leukaemia with ionizing radiations\r\n    and benzene, bladder cancer with the manufacture and use of dyes and\r\n    in the rubber industry, and liver cancer with the use of vinyl\r\n    chloride (IARC, 1987).\r\n\r\n    Cigarette smoke contains many toxic chemicals, including chemicals\r\n    that are DNA reactive and cytotoxic or become DNA reactive upon\r\n    metabolic activation. Consequently, cigarette smoke has the potential\r\n    to initiate genetic lesions. Moolgavkar et al. (1989) postulated\r\n    mechanisms by which cigarette smoke induces lung cancer by fitting the\r\n    two-stage clonal expansion model of carcinogenesis to lung cancer\r\n    mortality data derived from a large cohort of British doctors who\r\n    smoked. This analysis suggested that tobacco smoke affected both the\r\n    rates of mutation and cell proliferation involved in the model,\r\n    supporting the hypothesis that tobacco smoke acts as a complete\r\n    carcinogen.\r\n\r\n    Cigarette smoking is causally associated with cancer of the lung,\r\n    larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, pancreas, kidney and urinary bladder. It\r\n    is also associated with cancer of the nasal cavity, liver, uterine\r\n    cervix and myeloid leukaemia (RCP, 1962; US Surgeon General, 1982,\r\n    1989; IARC, 1986; Winkelstein, 1990; Brownson et al., 1993; Roush,\r\n    1996).\r\n\r\n    In 1991, in the USA, it was estimated that 90.3% of the lung cancer\r\n    deaths in men and 78.5% of lung cancer deaths in women were\r\n    attributable to cigarette smoking. Deaths from oesophageal cancer were\r\n    linked to smoking in 78.2% of the cases in men and 74.3% of the cases\r\n    in women. Smoking was held responsible for 81.2% of deaths from\r\n    laryngeal cancer in men and 86.7% in women, for 91.5% and 61.2%,\r\n    respectively, of deaths from oral cancer, and 46.5% and 36.7%,\r\n    respectively, of deaths from bladder cancer. Smoking-attributable\r\n    deaths from cancer of the kidney in men and women were 47.6 and 12.3%,\r\n    respectively, and for pancreatic cancer the figures were 28.6% and\r\n    33.3% respectively. In women, 32.4% of uterine cervical cancer deaths\r\n    were attributed to cigarette smoking (Shopland et al., 1991).\r\n\r\n    There has been a change in the rates of different types of lung cancer\r\n    among smokers. In 1950, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occurred 17\r\n    times more often than adenocarcinoma (AC) (Wynder & Graham, 1950) in\r\n    cigarette smokers. In 1991, Devesa et al. (1991) reported that in male\r\n    cigarette smokers the ratio of SCC to AC was 2.4:1 between 1969 and\r\n\r\n    1971, and changed to 1.4:1 between 1984 and 1986; in cigarette-smoking\r\n    women, the SCC to AC ratio changed from 3.6:1 in 1950 to 0.57:1 in\r\n    1984-1986. Between 1970 and 1980 some studies showed a 20-50%\r\n    reduction in risk of lung cancer for long-term smokers of filter\r\n    cigarettes as compared to smokers of non-filter cigarettes (IARC,\r\n    1986) but later studies indicated a similar risk for lung cancer in\r\n    smokers of filter and non-filter cigarettes (Stellman et al., 1997;\r\n    Thun et al., 1997). The changes in the ratio of SCC to AC, and the\r\n    disappearance of an advantage of filter cigarette smoking in terms of\r\n    lung cancer risk, have been related to changes in smoke yields, which\r\n    have caused smokers to modify patterns of puff drawing and smoke\r\n    inhalation. Smokers regulate the speed and the quantity of their\r\n    nicotine uptake to achieve the desired pharmacological effects\r\n    (Benowitz et al., 1988; Djordjevic et al., 1995). Smokers of lower\r\n    nicotine cigarettes draw puffs of greater volume, at a higher\r\n    frequency, and inhale more deeply; this is governed by the amount of\r\n    nicotine in the smoke (Wynder & Hoffmann, 1994).\r\n\r\n    Smoking is a major risk factor for the early stage development of\r\n    oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas, accounting for 40% of cases,\r\n    and may have contributed to the increase in the incidence of these\r\n    cancers, especially in older people (Gammon et al., 1997).\r\n\r\n    Cigar smoking is causally associated with cancer of the oral cavity,\r\n    the pharynx and the lung, even though for cigar smokers, who do not or\r\n    only minimally inhale the smoke, the lung cancer risk is considerably\r\n    lower than that for cigarette smokers. Cigar smoking is also\r\n    associated with cancer of the pancreas and of the urinary bladder\r\n    (NIH, 1998). Oral snuff users have an increased risk of cancer of the\r\n    oral cavity and, possibly, cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and\r\n    urinary bladder (US Surgeon General, 1986).\r\n\r\n    It has been suggested that around 4-5% of all lung cancer is related\r\n    to occupational exposure (Wynder & Gori, 1977; Doll & Peto, 1981;\r\n    Morgan, 1982 ). Occupational and any other forms of exposure to\r\n    chemical compounds are of limited importance in the etiology of lung\r\n    cancer whereas tobacco smoking is the cause of approximately 85-90% of\r\n    cases (Shopland et al., 1991).\r\n\r\n    \"Reverse smoking\", in which rolled tobacco leaves are smoked with the\r\n    burning end inside the mouth, has been linked to carcinoma of the hard\r\n    palate (Reddy & Rao, 1957; Mehta et al., 1971; Pindborg et al., 1971;\r\n    Reddy, 1974; Bhonsle et al., 1976). Reddy et al. (1960) simulated the\r\n    effect of reverse smoking experimentally by painting the skin of male\r\n    and female mice on alternate days with the tar from Indian cigars and\r\n    exposing the painted skin to a temperature of 58\u00b0C for 3 min; the heat\r\n    treatment enhanced the dermal tumour response. 2.2.4  Cardiovascular effects\r\n\r\n    Cigarette smoking is a major independent risk factor for\r\n    cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cigarette smoking acts synergistically\r\n    with other risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol levels and\r\n\r\n    hypertension (Wilhelmsen, 1977; Gibinski, 1977; US Surgeon General,\r\n    1983). Prospective studies indicated that elevated cholesterol and\r\n    hypertension appear to be prerequisites for CVD in cigarette smokers\r\n    (Kimura, 1977). It has been estimated that in countries with a long\r\n    history of cigarette smoking the tobacco habit is responsible for \r\n    26-30% of early deaths from CVD (US Surgeon General, 1983; Wald et \r\n    al., 1985). Those who smoke several cigars a day and inhale the smoke \r\n    also face an increased risk of CVD (NIH, 1998).\r\n\r\n    The major contributors to the cardiovascular effects of tobacco smoke\r\n    are carbon monoxide and nicotine (Lakier, 1992), as well as nitrogen\r\n    oxides (NOx), hydrogen cyanide and tar; minor contributors are\r\n    cadmium, zinc and carbon disulfide (US Surgeon General, 1983). The\r\n    smoke of cigarettes can be slightly acidic (pH 5.6-5.9) or weakly\r\n    alkaline (pH 6.7-7.9) depending on the type of tobacco and the blend\r\n    (Brunnemann & Hoffmann, 1974). In the slightly acidic smoke, nicotine\r\n    is protonated, i.e., bound to a salt or acid moiety and is part of the\r\n    particulate phase. Weakly alkaline smoke contains a small percentage\r\n    of protonated nicotine (often up to 50% of the nicotine is\r\n    unprotonated) in the vapour phase. In contrast to the protonated\r\n    variety, unprotonated nicotine is rapidly absorbed through the oral\r\n    mucosa and this is why smokers of cigarettes with weakly acidic smoke\r\n    and smokers of cigars do not need to inhale into the lung to\r\n    experience the pharmacological effects of nicotine. Protonated\r\n    nicotine in the particulate matter of slightly acidic cigarette smoke\r\n    is not or is only minimally absorbed through the oral mucosa, so that\r\n    smokers inhale the smoke and absorption into the bloodstream takes\r\n    place in the lung (Armitage & Turner, 1970; Russell, 1976; Benowitz et\r\n    al., 1988).\r\n\r\n    Smoking has been associated with a two-to-fourfold increased risk of\r\n    coronary heart disease (CHD), a greater than 70% excess rate of death\r\n    from CHD, and an elevated risk of sudden death (Lakier, 1992).\r\n    Nicotine causes increases in heart rate and blood pressure, stimulates\r\n    nerve endings that are activated by acetylcholine, causes increased\r\n    mobilization of free fatty acids in the serum and enhances platelet\r\n    adhesiveness. These effects increase cardiac load (which for\r\n    individuals with some forms of heart disease will not be met by\r\n    increased coronary blood flow) and interfere with metabolic exchange\r\n    across capillary walls, leading to ischaemic episodes and thrombosis.\r\n    Carbon monoxide increases carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations in the\r\n    blood and lowers its oxygen-carrying capacity: increased oxygen debt\r\n    after exercise and impairment of endurance performance are evident in\r\n    smokers, compared to non-smokers. Carbon monoxide also has an affinity\r\n    for myoglobin and interferes with oxygen uptake by the myocardium.\r\n\r\n    \"Bidi\" smoke contains a higher concentration of carbon monoxide than\r\n    cigarette smoke (Hoffmann et al., 1974; Jayant & Pakhale, 1985; Ball &\r\n    Simpson, 1987). Most of the Asian smoking devices with their\r\n    non-porous wrappers and dark tobacco contain higher levels of nicotine\r\n    (Simarak et al., 1977; WHO, 1985). High nicotine and carbon monoxide\r\n    are also obtained from many dark tobacco cigarettes and from cigars.\r\n    \"Sheesha\" water pipe smoke contains small amounts of nicotine but is\r\n\r\n    rich in carbon monoxide; the blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration in\r\n    sheesha smokers is higher than in cigarette smokers (Zahran et al.,\r\n    1985).\r\n\r\n    Cigarette smoking has been considered to be the primary cause of\r\n    Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), an inflammatory\r\n    obliterative, non-atherosclerotic, vascular disease. The disease\r\n    usually becomes quiescent if the patient stops smoking cigarettes\r\n    (Olin, 1994). It was rare in women but an increasing number of cases\r\n    has been observed and ascribed to the increased use of tobacco by\r\n    young women (Yorukoglu et al., 1993).\r\n\r\n    Cardiovascular disease has been associated with exposure to other\r\n    factors, which can be classified as physical, chemical and biological,\r\n    and with occupation or life-style. The combination of smoking with any\r\n    of these factors will predispose to an increased detrimental\r\n    cardiovascular effect.\r\n\r\n    In women who smoke, peripheral vasoconstriction (PV) leading to acute\r\n    intervillous placental blood flow was measured during smoking and\r\n    attributed to nicotine, which simultaneously caused increases in heart\r\n    rate and blood pressure. It was suggested that PV explained fetal\r\n    growth retardation and other complications of pregnancy (Lehtovirta &\r\n    Forss, 1978). 2.2.5  Smoking and occupational accidents, injuries and\r\n           absenteeism\r\n\r\n    A survey of public employees found that cigarette smokers took 23%\r\n    more sick leave than non-smokers (Van Tuinen & Land, 1986). In another\r\n    study among 2537 postal workers in the USA, cigarette smokers had a\r\n    1.29 times higher accident rate (CI 1.07-1.55), and a 1.55 times\r\n    higher injury rate (CI 1.11-1.77) than non-smokers (Ryan et al.,\r\n    1992). Other studies confirm the higher rates of injury, occupational\r\n    accidents and absenteeism in smokers (Naus et al., 1966; Parka, 1983;\r\n    US Surgeon General, 1985; Hawker & Holtby, 1988). There are higher\r\n    costs of illness for cigarette smoking employees compared to\r\n    non-smokers (Van Peenen et al., 1986; Penner & Penner, 1990. 2.3  Health risks from smokeless tobacco use 2.3.1  Introduction\r\n\r\n    Oral cancers have been linked with oral tobacco use. The consequences\r\n    of chewing tobacco can be reactional keratosis, irreversible gingival\r\n    recession, periodontitis, oral dysplasia and leukoplakia, cancer and\r\n    cardiovascular effects (Chakrabarti et al., 1991; Guggenheimer, 1991).\r\n    In India, chewing material containing tobacco has been shown to be a\r\n    primary cause of oral cancer (Jussawalla & Deshpande, 1971). 2.3.2  Cancer\r\n\r\n    Leukoplakia and oral cancer are common results of oral tobacco use,\r\n    particularly in the countries of Asia (IARC, 1985a). Simarak et al.\r\n    (1977) reported a strong association between betel chewing and oral\r\n    cancer in northern Thailand. Sankaranarayanan et al. (1989a,b, 1990)\r\n    associated oral cancers in southern India with tobacco chewing.\r\n    Chakrabarti et al. (1991) reported much higher levels of pre-malignant\r\n    and malignant lesions of the oral cavity in tobacco chewers;\r\n    Nandakumar et al. (1990) found the relative risk to be elevated in\r\n    both sexes, but appreciably higher in females. From chemical analysis\r\n    of Indian tobacco products, it was concluded that their use may lead\r\n    to high exposures to carcinogenic tobacco nitrosamines (Nair et al.,\r\n    1989).\r\n\r\n    Case-control studies reported a higher incidence of oral cancer in\r\n    oral snuff users than in those not using any form of tobacco. There\r\n    was up to a 50-fold excess risk of cancer of the cheek and gum in\r\n    long-term oral snuff users (Ax\u00e9ll et al., 1978; US Surgeon General,\r\n    1986a; Winn, 1997). Idris et al. (1991, 1994), reported a high\r\n    incidence rate of oral cancer in men in northern Sudan who used an\r\n    oral snuff with relatively high concentrations of nicotine (0.8-3.2%)\r\n    and nornicotine. In a study of baseball players who chewed or (the\r\n    majority) used snuff orally, there was higher prevalence of\r\n    leukoplakia, plaque formation, gingivitis and dental disorders\r\n    compared to non-users (Robertson et al., 1997).\r\n\r\n    A case-control study on nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer and\r\n    snuff use showed that snuff users have a significantly increased risk\r\n    for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the nasal cavity\r\n    (Brinton et al., 1984). N'-nitrosonornicotine is present and is an\r\n    organ-specific carcinogen that induces benign and malignant tumours of\r\n    the nasal cavity in rats, hamsters and mink (Rivenson et al., 1991;\r\n    Koppang et al., 1992, 1997; Hoffmann et al., 1994). Studies conducted\r\n    in South Africa showed that people using local snuff made from tobacco\r\n    and aloe plant ash as nasal applications have an increased risk for\r\n    tumours of the maxillary antrum (Keen et al., 1955). It was thought\r\n    that this snuff mixture contained high levels of nickel and chromium,\r\n    which may be associated with the induction of these tumours (Baumslag\r\n    et al., 1971).\r\n\r\n    Instillation of snuff into the lips of rats induced benign and\r\n    malignant tumours in the oral cavity (Hirsch & Thilander, 1981; Hecht\r\n    et al., 1986; Johansson et al., 1989; Larsson et al., 1989).\r\n    Instillation of snuff into the buccal pouch of hamsters, which were\r\n    repeatedly infected with Herpes simplex virus type I or II, led to\r\n    oral tumours, although no tumours occurred when either the virus or\r\n    tobacco was applied alone (Park et al., 1991b).\r\n\r\n    More than 3050 chemical compounds have been identified as tobacco\r\n    constituents (Roberts, 1988) and 50 are known carcinogens (Brunnemann\r\n    & Hoffmann, 1992). Nitrosamines, especially the tobacco-specific\r\n    nitrosamines (TSNA), must be regarded as major oral carcinogens. Oral\r\n\r\n    tumours were elicited when an aqueous solution of N-nitrosonornicotine\r\n    (NNN) and 4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) was\r\n    applied to the oral surfaces of rats (Hecht et al., 1993). 2.3.3  Cardiovascular disease\r\n\r\n    The effect of tobacco chewing on cardiovascular disease has received\r\n    less attention than the effect of cancer. Benowitz et al. (1988)\r\n    compared the cardiovascular effects of smokeless tobacco, cigarettes\r\n    and nicotine gum and reported that all tobacco use increased heart\r\n    rate and blood pressure. Nanda & Sharma (1988) recorded incremental\r\n    increases in heart rate and blood pressure following tobacco chewing.\r\n    However, Eliasson et al. (1991) found no significant elevation of\r\n    diastolic blood pressure in young snuff users. Bolinder et al. (1994)\r\n    found an excess risk of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular\r\n    disease among smokeless tobacco users. Tobacco chewing has detrimental\r\n    effects on pregnancy (Krishna, 1978) which, in the absence of any\r\n    anoxia due to carbon monoxide found in smokers, could result from\r\n    nicotine-induced vasoconstriction.\r\n\r\n    O'Dell et al. (1987) reported a case of Buerger's disease in a\r\n    38-year-old man that was associated with the use of smokeless tobacco.\r\n    A regimen which included complete abstinence from tobacco resulted in\r\n    a resolution of the symptoms. Buerger's disease is the commonest\r\n    vascular disease in the Indian subcontinent where tobacco consumption\r\n    is high (Jindal & Patel, 1992). In a study of the disease in\r\n    Bangladesh, 39 patients (38 males, 1 female) were investigated. All\r\n    but two were current long-term smokers, one male had given up smoking\r\n    6 months previously and the one woman with the disease (it is uncommon\r\n    in women) was a tobacco chewer (Grove & Stansby, 1992). 3.  EFFECTS ON HEALTH OF TOBACCO USE AND EXPOSURE TO OTHER CHEMICALS 3.1  Introduction 3.1.1  Interaction\r\n\r\n    To discuss the interaction between tobacco and other agents as risk\r\n    factors for cancer and other adverse health effects, it is necessary\r\n    to define what is meant by the term \"interaction\". In general terms,\r\n    interaction represents a departure from additivity, in which the\r\n    combined effect of exposure to two agents is in some sense the sum of\r\n    the effects of the individual agents (US EPA, 1988). Synergism occurs\r\n    when the combined effect is greater than the sum of the component\r\n    effects; antagonism occurs when the effect of the combination is less\r\n    than would be suggested by summing the effects of the components. 3.1.2  Measuring interaction\r\n\r\n    To make these concepts precise, the scale in which risk is measured\r\n    and the manner in which risks are summed must be specified (Kaldor &\r\n    L'Abbe, 1990). In epidemiological investigations, the age-adjusted\r\n    relative risk is often used to characterize risk. In risk assessment\r\n    applications involving chronic health effects such as cancer, the\r\n    cumulative risk over a period of time may be of more direct interest.\r\n    In laboratory studies of carcinogenicity, for example, the lifetime\r\n    probability of tumour induction is often used to describe risk. In\r\n    order to take into account the age at which an adverse effect is\r\n    induced, the expected loss in life expectancy has also been used to\r\n    evaluate risk (UNSCEAR, 1988).\r\n\r\n    Kodell & Pounds (1991) discuss interaction in terms of departures from response additivity and dose additivity. Dose additivity occurs\r\n    when the combined effect of two agents can be expressed in terms of a\r\n    total dose of the two agents, taking into account their relative\r\n    potencies. Dose additivity presumes that the two agents act by the\r\n    same biological mechanism, and that the effective dose of one agent is\r\n    simply a dilution of the dose of the other agent. Response additivity\r\n    occurs when the two agents act independently of each other. In this\r\n    case, the probabilities of an adverse effect due to each of the agents\r\n    can be treated as statistically independent and can be combined\r\n    accordingly.\r\n\r\n    The quantification of interaction may be illustrated using the\r\n    age-specific relative risk (A,B) associated with exposure to two\r\n    agents A and B. The relative risk is formally defined as:\r\n\r\n              relative risk (A,B) = I(A,B)/I(0,0)\r\n\r\n         where I(A,B) denotes the incidence rate of the disease of\r\n         interest at a specified age in the presence of exposure and\r\n         I(0,0) is the incidence rate in the absence of exposure. Lack of\r\n         interaction then corresponds to additivity of the excess relative\r\n         risk (ERR = relative risk - 1).\r\n\r\n         Specifically,\r\n\r\n              ERR(A,B) = ERR(A,0) + ERR(0,B)\r\n\r\n         where ERR(A,0) and ERR(0,B) denote the excess relative risks for\r\n         A and B alone, respectively. In terms of relative risk,\r\n         additivity is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n         relative risk (A,B) = relative risk (A,0) + relative risk \r\n         (0,B) - 1\r\n\r\n    For a supra-additive relative risk relationship, such as the\r\n    multiplicative relative risk model:\r\n\r\n         relative risk (A,B) = relative risk (A,0)RR(0,B)\r\n\r\n    and reflects a synergistic effect.\r\n\r\n    It is of interest to note that as the relative risk (A,0) and relative\r\n    risk (0,B) become small, the multiplicative relative risk model\r\n    approximates the additive relative risk model. Under this \r\n    multiplicative model, a strong synergistic relationship may be \r\n    apparent at high exposures, yet become negligible at low exposures. \r\n    This, along with the realization that relative risks of less than \r\n    about two are difficult to detect epidemiologically, suggests that \r\n    relatively high exposures are likely to be required to evaluate \r\n    interactive effects reliably.\r\n\r\n    Brown & Chu (1989) and Kodell et al. (1991) investigated the type of\r\n    interactions that might be expected under both the Armitage-Doll\r\n    multi-stage model and the Moolgavkar-Venzon-Knudson two-stage model of\r\n    carcinogenesis following exposure to two carcinogens that may affect\r\n    different stages in the model. These theoretical results indicate that\r\n    a variety of synergistic interactions are possible, including\r\n    supra-additive, multiplicative, and supra-multiplicative.\r\n\r\n    Although the additive excess relative risk model described above\r\n    provides a useful baseline for evaluating interaction, it is not the\r\n    only model that has been proposed for this purpose. Kaldor & L'Abbe\r\n    (1990) pointed out that the multiplicative relative risk model will\r\n    become the baseline model for evaluating interactions following a\r\n    logarithmic transformation of the relative risk. Thomas & Whittemore\r\n    (1988) review arguments in favour of the additive and multiplicative\r\n    models as the basis for evaluating interaction. Steenland & Thun\r\n    (1986) illustrate how these two models can be applied in evaluating\r\n    tobacco/occupation interactions in the causation of lung cancer.\r\n\r\n    This brief overview illustrates that interaction can be measured in\r\n    different ways, with the most appropriate depending on the nature of\r\n    the problem at hand. In general, however, all of the commonly\r\n    encountered measures of synergism indicate that the risk associated\r\n    with combined exposure to two agents is in some sense greater than\r\n    would be expected based on the risks of individual exposures. Although\r\n\r\n    no attempt is made throughout this monograph to systematically specify\r\n    the precise nature of the interactive effects reported in the\r\n    literature, most interactive effects documented in this monograph have\r\n    been identified through epidemiological investigations, in which the\r\n    additive age-specific relative risk model is the predominant approach\r\n    to describing interaction (Saracci, 1987; Greenland, 1993).\r\n\r\n    There are four principal ways in which tobacco smoke can interact with\r\n    other chemicals to impair the health of the smoker. They are not\r\n    mutually exclusive and in fact there are many situations in which they\r\n    may occur together, particularly in the workplace or the environs of\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    a)  Modification of effects\r\n\r\n    Cigarette smoke can modify the harmful effects associated with other\r\n    toxic agents, in some cases causing a highly elevated risk, e.g., the\r\n    effects of smoking on diseases related to asbestos, alpha-radiation,\r\n    arsenic and some organic compounds.\r\n\r\n    b)  Increased concentration effects\r\n\r\n    Chemical compounds hazardous to health are often found in both tobacco\r\n    smoke and the working environment and each source can augment the dose\r\n    obtained from the other, e.g., carbon monoxide, acrolein, benzene and\r\n    heavy metal elements.\r\n\r\n    c)  Vector effects\r\n\r\n    Materials used in the workplace that produce harmful chemical agents\r\n    when they are burnt or vaporized can contaminate smoking materials and\r\n    cause the smoke to be far more injurious when the tobacco is smoked,\r\n    e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene and methylparathion.\r\n\r\n    d)  Other interactions\r\n\r\n    Tobacco smoke can affect a physiological process and increase the\r\n    impairment of physical or physiological functions caused by another\r\n    activity. For instance, impaired lung clearance will affect the\r\n    residence time of inhaled toxic materials, the effect of smoking on\r\n    the peripheral vascular system can enhance the detrimental effects of\r\n    vibration and noise, and smoking may alter the effect of drugs taken\r\n    for other purposes. 3.1.3  Effects of tobacco smoking on lung deposition and clearance of\r\n           particles\r\n\r\n    Pulmonary deposition of inspired particles depends on their\r\n    physicochemical properties and on airway structure and geometry.\r\n    Mathematical models describing the deposition of particles in the\r\n    various airway sections show that in compromised airways, as is the\r\n    case in patients suffering from asthma and chronic obstructive lung\r\n    diseases, particle deposition is enhanced several-fold (ICRP, 1994).\r\n\r\n    Tobacco smoking can be an indirect cause of enhanced deposition of\r\n    inspirable particles. In addition, during tobacco smoking the\r\n    breathing pattern is changed to more frequent and deeper inhalation,\r\n    especially in the case of low-nicotine cigarettes, which can result in\r\n    an increased inhaled dose and dose rate of inspirable compounds (IARC,\r\n    1990).\r\n\r\n    Clearance of particles deposited in the lung is a complex\r\n    physiological process involving relatively rapid tracheobronchial\r\n    clearance, in which mucus is moved upward by ciliary action to the\r\n    pharynx and swallowed, and slower deep-lung clearance, in which\r\n    phagocytic cells remove inhaled particles. These processes are\r\n    balanced by the solubility of the inhaled particles, with relatively\r\n    insoluble particles having a longer residence time in the alveolar\r\n    portions of the lungs. A longer residence time in the lung would be\r\n    accompanied by a greater possibility that harmful effects could occur.\r\n    Both rapid and slow clearance phases are reduced by smoking, although\r\n    probably by different mechanisms. Cigarette smoke contains significant\r\n    concentrations of ciliatoxic agents, such as hydrogen cyanide,\r\n    formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and nitrogen oxides, which\r\n    greatly contribute to retarded clearance of inhaled particles by\r\n    inhibiting lung clearance mechanisms (Battista, 1976). Retardation of\r\n    clearance has been seen for airway-deposited particles, in which\r\n    decreased mucus transport velocities slow this normally relatively\r\n    rapid phase of clearance (Lourenco et al., 1971; Chopra et al., 1979).\r\n\r\n    The deep-lung clearance of relatively insoluble particles is retarded\r\n    in smokers. Cohen et al. (1979) found that 1 year after a tracer\r\n    particle exposure, some 50% and 10% of the original lung burden\r\n    remained in the lungs of smokers and non-smokers, respectively.\r\n    Bohning et al. (1982) and Philipson et al. (1996) found that smoking\r\n    retarded long-term particle clearance from the lungs. The mechanism(s)\r\n    for interference with this longer-term phase of clearance has not been\r\n    shown definitively, but may be related to impairment of phagocyte\r\n    function and/or smoke-induced lung damage. 3.2  Interactions between tobacco smoke and other agents 3.2.1  Asbestos\r\n\r\n    Asbestos is a generic name for a group of fibrous silicates, differing\r\n    in colour, fibre arrangement and length. Recognition of the health\r\n    risks of asbestos has led to major reductions in production and uses.\r\n    Asbestos types are classified according to their physical\r\n    characteristics as serpentine or amphibole and differ in their\r\n    relative carcinogenic potential. Amosite and crocidolite are\r\n    amphiboles and have short and straight needle-like fibres. Chrysotile\r\n    is a serpentine and consists of long, pliable white fibres. The longer\r\n    fibre varieties of asbestos can be spun into yarn which can be woven\r\n    into fabric; short fibre varieties can be incorporated into cement,\r\n    asbestos board and tiles. Asbestos products have been used in a\r\n    variety of applications including electrical and thermal insulation in\r\n    buildings, fire and safety equipment, brake linings of motor vehicles,\r\n\r\n    and shipbuilding. Workers in asbestos mining and processing and a wide\r\n    range of manufacturing industries are exposed to various forms of\r\n    asbestos, while others are exposed in maintenance work, demolition and\r\n    recycling operations.\r\n\r\n    Occupational exposure to asbestos is associated with asbestosis and\r\n    cancers at various sites, notably pleural mesothelioma and lung\r\n    cancer. Differences between the effect of asbestos on the health of\r\n    smokers and non-smokers have been reported, and studies have been\r\n    conducted aimed specifically at elucidating the combined effects of\r\n    smoking and asbestos exposure. Perioccupational exposure to asbestos\r\n    is a hazard to household contacts of asbestos workers, who bring home\r\n    dust on their clothes, and to people living in areas where there is\r\n    environmental contamination by asbestos dust from industry (Anderson\r\n    et al., 1979).\r\n\r\n    The amphibole varieties of asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) have the\r\n    highest carcinogenic risk. Crocidolite presents a greater risk than\r\n    amosite, which in turn is more dangerous than chrysotile, a serpentine\r\n    variety. Erionite and tremolite are non-asbestos fibrous minerals used\r\n    in building in some parts of the world and there is a high prevalence\r\n    of mesothelioma in these regions (Baris et al., 1979; Yazicioglu et\r\n    al., 1980).\r\n\r\n    Because there are many different occupations and environmental\r\n    situations in which asbestos exposure might occur, along with a wide\r\n    range of possible levels of exposure and variety of types of asbestos\r\n    in use, it is difficult to define clearly asbestos exposure or the\r\n    smoking habits of those exposed. The smoking history of the population\r\n    sampled is important, because there have been changes in smoking\r\n    materials and prevalences of smoking in many countries (Cheng & Kong,\r\n    1992). In many studies, only the number of smokers within sub-groups\r\n    of workers with asbestos-related disease have been reported, rather\r\n    than the detailed smoking habits of the exposed population. A widely\r\n    used assumption is that the smoking habits of asbestos-exposed workers\r\n    reflect those of blue collar workers and are thus higher than national\r\n    average figures. Table 5 gives examples of smoking prevalence in\r\n    different groups of asbestos-exposed workers.\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.1  Asbestos and lung cancer\r\n\r\n    Exposure to asbestos dust carries a risk of parenchymal and pleural\r\n    fibrosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer. Selikoff et al. (1968) and\r\n    Berry et al. (1972) showed that cigarette smoking was an added hazard\r\n    among asbestos workers. In combination, the two hazards are associated\r\n    with very high lung cancer rates. Studies were carried out (e.g.,\r\n    Hammond & Selikoff, 1973; Martischnig et al., 1977; Hammond et al.,\r\n    1979; Selikoff et al., 1980; Acheson et al., 1984; Berry et al., 1985)\r\n    to determine whether cigarette smoke and asbestos act independently, \r\n\r\n\r\n        Table 5.

In some studies, the effects of smoke and\r\n    asbestos appeared to be additive, in others multiplicative and in\r\n    others somewhere between the two. Reasons for the lack of consistency\r\n    among the studies may relate to the size of the population sampled,\r\n    its average age, social class and residential area, the type of\r\n    asbestos involved, the time scale covered and the intensity of\r\n    exposure to asbestos. The weight of evidence favours a synergistic or\r\n    multiplicative model for the interaction of asbestos and smoking.\r\n    While the differences may be partly linked to the carcinogenic\r\n    potential of different types of asbestos and to different smoking\r\n    materials and ways of smoking, including passive smoking (Cheng &\r\n    Kong, 1992), they also reflect the complex nature of tobacco smoke,\r\n    which contains complete carcinogens, tumour promoters and\r\n    co-carcinogens and other compounds that can influence the multistage\r\n    carcinogenic process. However, whatever the type of smoking/asbestos\r\n    interaction influencing the incidence of lung cancer, there is a\r\n    greatly increased risk for the asbestos-exposed worker who smokes\r\n    (Table 6).\r\n\r\n    Hammond et al. (1979) found a very strong synergistic effect and this\r\n    was supported by studies of shipyard workers in Italy (Bovenzi et al.,\r\n    1993), asbestos factory workers in London (Newhouse & Berry, 1979),\r\n    Finnish anthophyllite miners and millers (Meurman et al., 1979),\r\n    chrysotile workers in China (Cheng & Kong, 1992; Zhu & Wang, 1993) and\r\n    workers exposed to crocidolite in Western Australia (de Klerk et al.,\r\n    1991). Cheng & Kong (1992) reported a lower ratio of non-smoking to\r\n    smoking lung cancer death rates and suggested that this reflected\r\n    passive smoking among non-smokers and the use by most smokers of\r\n    hand-rolled cigarettes. Liddell et al. (1984) found that their data\r\n    fitted both an additive model and a multiplicative model and concluded\r\n    that the combined relative risk lay somewhere between the two.\r\n    Selikoff et al. (1980), from a study of amosite factory workers, and\r\n    Berry et al. (1985), from a study of asbestos factory workers,\r\n    favoured an additive model. However, caution is required because of\r\n    the definitions of additive and multiplicative used by different\r\n    authors and the overlap between these terms and such words as\r\n    synergism and promoter.\r\n\r\n    Molecular biology studies of autopsy specimens of lung tumour tissue\r\n    from of cigarette smokers have revealed that cigarette smoking induces\r\n    K-ras mutation (Rodenhuis & Slebos, 1992). It has been suggested that\r\n    such cigarette-smoke-induced K-ras oncogene mutations are promoted by\r\n    the presence of asbestos, which creates selective growth conditions\r\n    for the mutated cells (Vainio et al., 1993). Vainio & Boffetta (1994)\r\n    concluded that both tobacco smoke and asbestos fibres can be genotoxic\r\n    and cytotoxic, and cause proliferative lesions in the lungs. Tobacco\r\n    smoke contains carcinogens that bind to critical genes and cause\r\n    mutations. Asbestos fibres cause chronic inflammation of the lungs,\r\n    which releases various cytokines and growth factors, and may provide a\r\n    selective growth advantage for mutated cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Table 6.

In shipyard workers mainly exposed to chrysotile,\r\n    Sanden et al. (1992) found an increase in pleural mesotheliomas up to\r\n    15 years after cessation of exposure. Asbestos is also linked with\r\n    peritoneal mesothelioma (Newhouse & Berry, 1976). The risk of lung\r\n    cancer was found to fall after exposure ceased, suggesting that\r\n    asbestos acted as a lung cancer promoter, but the risk of mesothelioma\r\n    long after cessation of exposure indicated that asbestos acted as a\r\n    complete carcinogen. Mesothelioma can have an extremely long latent\r\n    period, with cases presenting even 30 years or more after first\r\n    exposure (Newhouse & Berry, 1976). Up to 90% of cases of pleural\r\n    mesothelioma have been attributed to asbestos but there is no evidence\r\n    directly associating smoking with the disease, or showing that smoking\r\n    has any influence on the incidence of asbestos-related pleural\r\n    mesothelioma (Berry et al., 1985; Hughes & Weill, 1991; Sanden &\r\n    Jarvholm, 1991; Muscat & Wynder, 1991).\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.3  Asbestos and other forms of cancer\r\n\r\n    Asbestos fibres have been found in many tissues, other than the lungs,\r\n    of asbestos workers. There is evidence that an asbestos/smoking\r\n    interaction increases the incidence of cancer of the oesophagus,\r\n    pharynx, buccal cavity and larynx but not of pleural or peritoneal\r\n    mesothelioma, or of cancer of the stomach, colon-rectum or kidney, for\r\n    which smoking and non-smoking asbestos workers are at equal risk\r\n    (Hammond et al., 1979; Selikoff & Frank, 1983; US ATSDR, 1995).\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.4  Asbestosis\r\n\r\n    Asbestosis is a fibrotic reaction to asbestos in the lungs. In a\r\n    review of histological, animal experimental and radiological evidence,\r\n    Weiss (1984) concluded that cigarette smoking could result in diffuse\r\n    fibrosis similar to that caused by asbestos, and the fibrosis showed a\r\n    dose-response to the duration and degree of smoking. Prevalence\r\n    studies are consistent in showing a higher frequency of diffuse small\r\n    irregular opacities in asbestos workers who are smokers than in those\r\n    who are non-smokers. It has been suggested that the effects may be\r\n    additive. Tobacco smoke affects lung clearance and hence the retention\r\n    of asbestos fibres in the lungs. In asbestosis the intensity of\r\n    fibrosis correlates with the number of asbestos bodies in the lungs,\r\n    and Murai et al. (1994) concluded that reduction of lung clearance by\r\n    tobacco smoke could increase the intensity of fibrosis. Crocidolite\r\n    fibres are the most fibrogenic of the various types of asbestos but\r\n    De Klerk et al. (1991) concluded that smoking had no measurable effect\r\n    on crocidolite asbestosis.\r\n\r\n    An interaction between asbestos and smoking causing a greater\r\n    frequency of obstructive airways disease in asbestos workers who smoke\r\n    was found in a study of pulmonary function changes caused by\r\n    asbestosis (Selikoff & Frank, 1983). Miller (1993) presented similar\r\n\r\n    results suggesting an interaction between asbestos and smoking. In a\r\n    prospective mortality study, Hughes & Weill (1991) concluded that\r\n    asbestosis is a precursor of asbestos-related lung cancer, but they\r\n    were unable to assess an interaction between tobacco smoking and\r\n    asbestosis because all the cases were in smokers and there were no\r\n    non-smokers.\r\n\r\n    In rats, asbestos fibres stimulate alveolar macrophages to generate\r\n    the inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, tumour necrosis\r\n    factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and this may be the cause of inflammation \r\n    and lung fibrosis due to asbestos (Ljungman et al., 1994). In in vitro studies Morimoto et al. (1993) found synergism between chrysotile\r\n    fibres and cigarette smoke in the stimulation of the formation of\r\n    TNF-alpha by rat alveolar macrophages. 3.3  Non-asbestos fibres 3.3.1  Glass fibre\r\n\r\n    IARC (1988) classified glasswool as possibly carcinogenic to humans\r\n    (Group 2B) and glass filaments as not classifiable as to their\r\n    carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3), based on sufficient evidence for\r\n    the carcinogenicity of glasswool and inadequate evidence for the\r\n    carcinogenicity of glass filaments in experimental animals and\r\n    inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of glasswool and glass\r\n    filaments in humans. There are data on exposure to glass fibre and\r\n    tobacco smoke. Enterline et al. (1987a) carried out a case control\r\n    study of 7586 glasswool workers in four plants producing small\r\n    diameter fibres, less than 3 \u00b5m in diameter. Smoking histories were\r\n    obtained for 75% of the workers. Analysis of data by logistic\r\n    regression showed that smoking was a powerful variable and multiplied\r\n    the effect of fibre exposure. In a case-control study of the influence\r\n    of non-workplace factors on respiratory disease in employees of a\r\n    glass fibre manufacturing facility, Chiazze et al. (1992, 1995)\r\n    concluded that smoking, and not exposure to glass fibre, was the most\r\n    important risk factor for the increased lung cancer risk but was not\r\n    as important for non-malignant respiratory disease. In a further\r\n    analysis, using data not previously available, Chiazze et al. (1995)\r\n    estimated the extent of confounding by cigarette smoking, and\r\n    suggested that adjusting for the confounding effect could reduce the\r\n    lung cancer standardized mortality ratio to a non-statistically\r\n    significant level. 3.3.2  Rockwool, slagwool and ceramic fibres\r\n\r\n    IARC (1988) concluded that there was limited evidence for the\r\n    carcinogenicity of rockwool and inadequate evidence for the\r\n    carcinogenicity of slagwool in experimental animals, with limited\r\n    evidence for the carcinogenicity of rock-/slagwool in humans: the\r\n    overall evaluation for both was Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to\r\n    humans. For ceramic fibres there was sufficient evidence for their\r\n\r\n    carcinogenicity in experimental animals, with no data on their\r\n    carcinogenicity in humans: the overall evaluation for ceramic fibres\r\n    was also Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans.\r\n\r\n    In a study of insulation workers using rock and glass wool, (Clausen\r\n    et al., 1993) concluded that exposure was associated with an increased\r\n    risk of developing obstructive lung disease. In a study of respiratory\r\n    health in 628 workers in seven European plants manufacturing ceramic\r\n    fibres, skin, eye and nasal irritation, breathlessness and wheezing\r\n    were common findings (Trethowan et al., 1995). Respiratory symptoms\r\n    were more frequent in smokers and increased with the amount smoked.\r\n    The authors concluded that exposure caused irritation, similar to that\r\n    caused by other man-made fibres, and that cumulative exposure could\r\n    cause airways obstruction by promoting the effects of cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\n    Ljungman et al. (1994) demonstrated in rats that rock wool, slag wool,\r\n    kaolin ceramic fibre and silicon carbide fibre stimulated alveolar\r\n    macrophages to generate tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a\r\n    potent inflammatory and fibrogenic mediator. In in vitro studies\r\n    Morimoto et al. (1993) found synergism between mineral fibres\r\n    (chrysotile and alumina silicate ceramic fibres) and cigarette smoke\r\n    in the stimulation of the formation of TNF-alpha by rat alveolar\r\n    macrophages. Leanderson & Tagesson (1989) found that cigarette smoke\r\n    potentiated the DNA-damaging effect of man-made mineral fibres\r\n    (rockwool, glasswool and ceramic fibres). 3.4  Inorganic chemicals 3.4.1  Arsenic\r\n\r\n    Compounds of arsenic have been used as pesticides and as preservatives\r\n    of wood and leather. Arsenic is present in many metal ores and is\r\n    released during smelting Radon progeny are frequently encountered as a\r\n    contaminant of arsenic. In some parts of the world arsenic is found in\r\n    drinking-water in relatively high concentrations.\r\n\r\n    Arsenic and its compounds are carcinogenic (WHO, 1980; IARC, 1987;\r\n    Tsuda et al., 1990, 1995). Skin cancer can occur after ingestion of\r\n    arsenic (Tseng et al., 1968; Smith et al., 1992), and lung cancer\r\n    after inhalation of arsenic by smelter workers or by people living\r\n    nearby (Welch et al., 1982; Pershagen, 1985; Pershagen et al., 1987)\r\n    or by agricultural workers exposed to the pesticide lead arsenate\r\n    (Wicklund et al., 1988). IARC (1987) classed arsenic and arsenic\r\n    compounds as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. It has been suggested\r\n    that arsenic in drinking-water may also cause liver, lung, kidney and\r\n    bladder cancer (Smith et al., 1992).\r\n\r\n    A study of the lung cancer risk among cadmium-exposed workers\r\n    suggested that exposure to arsenic and tobacco smoke may have been the\r\n    cause of an increased rate of lung cancer, rather than exposure to\r\n    cadmium particulates (Lamm et al., 1992). Tsuda et al. (1990)\r\n    suggested an interaction between arsenic and smoking in exposed\r\n    workers in a small Japanese village where arsenic was mined and\r\n\r\n    refined. However, the village water and air were highly polluted by\r\n    emissions from the smelter and from slag disposal, making interaction\r\n    between arsenic and smoking difficult to assess. A study of copper\r\n    smelter workers in the USA indicated that the effect of arsenic was\r\n    probably more important in lung cancer than that of tobacco smoke\r\n    (Welch et al., 1982). Studies in Sweden showed increased lung cancer\r\n    risks from arsenic exposure at a copper smelter; a multiplicative\r\n    effect for smoking and arsenic was found and age-standardized rate\r\n    ratios for lung cancer mortality were 3.0 for arsenic-exposed workers,\r\n    4.9 for smokers with no arsenic exposure and 14.6 for arsenic-exposed\r\n    smokers (Pershagen et al., 1981). In a later study, Pershagen (1985)\r\n    reported an additive effect for smoking and arsenic exposure on lung\r\n    cancer incidence in situations where the arsenic exposure was lower.\r\n    In a cohort of 3916 Swedish copper smelter workers, the risk of\r\n    developing lung cancer from the interaction between arsenic and\r\n    smoking was intermediate between additive and multiplicative and\r\n    appeared to be less pronounced among heavy smokers (Jarup & Pershagen,\r\n    1991).\r\n\r\n    There was no evidence of synergism between arsenic and tobacco smoke\r\n    in tin miners in Yunan Province, China. The lung cancer risk was\r\n    greater for arsenic than for smoking, and simultaneous assessment of\r\n    arsenic and radon exposure revealed radon to be the greater risk\r\n    (Taylor et al., 1989). In Ontario it was concluded that the excess\r\n    lung cancer mortality of gold miners and uranium miners was probably\r\n    due to exposure to arsenic and short-lived radon decay products\r\n    (Kusiak et al., 1991). This was consistent with the hypothesis that\r\n    the risk of lung cancer from exposure to arsenic is enhanced by\r\n    exposure to other carcinogens (Kusiak et al., 1993).\r\n\r\n    Hertz-Picciotto et al. (1992) assembled data from several studies to\r\n    examine possible synergism between smoking and exposure to arsenic and\r\n    an increased risk of lung cancer. The joint effect from both exposures\r\n    consistently exceeded the sum of the separate effects: a minimum of\r\n    30% to 54% of lung cancer cases among those with both exposures could\r\n    not be attributed to either one or the other exposure alone. The\r\n    conclusion was that arsenic and smoking acted synergistically to cause\r\n    lung cancer. Arsenic-induced lung cancer was not limited to exposure\r\n    to inhaled arsenic because there was evidence of synergism between\r\n    ingested arsenic and smoking (Tsuda et al., 1995). An association of\r\n    arsenic exposures with bladder cancer was confined to subjects who had\r\n    been smokers Bates et al. (1995).\r\n\r\n    In a Swedish study of lung cancer in arsenic workers, it was found\r\n    that cases among smelter workers who had never smoked showed a\r\n    histological distribution resembling that of smokers, probably\r\n    reflecting an exposure to carcinogenic agents at the smelter which\r\n    influence the risk of different histological types in the same way as\r\n    smoking (Pershagen et al., 1987). Tobacco smoking primarily induces\r\n    epidermoid and small cell carcinomas but there are also increased\r\n    risks for other cell types. The proportion of small cell carcinomas\r\n    was greater in uranium miners than in the general population (Kusiak\r\n\r\n    et al., 1993). In smokers, there were no pronounced differences in the\r\n    histological type of lung carcinomas between arsenic exposed smelter\r\n    workers and controls (Pershagen et al., 1987).\r\n\r\n    It has been suggested that the potentiation of the carcinogenic\r\n    properties of arsenic by smoking could be due to inorganic arsenic\r\n    requiring a strong co-carcinogen to manifest a carcinogenic effect, or\r\n    that arsenic itself might be acting as co-carcinogen rather than as a\r\n    direct carcinogen (Stohrer, 1991; Tsuda et al., 1995). 3.4.2  Beryllium\r\n\r\n    Beryllium is a metal with a number of uses including alloys, nuclear\r\n    energy applications, and in the rocket and aerospace industry (IPCS,\r\n    1990; IARC, 1993). Fine dusts and fumes of the metal and some of its\r\n    salts are hazardous and when inhaled are deposited in the lungs from\r\n    where beryllium may be widely distributed throughout the body.\r\n\r\n    Beryllium metal, oxide and some salts give rise to acute inflammation\r\n    on skin contact, particularly when accompanied by friction or\r\n    perspiration. Short exposure to dusts and fumes can cause acute\r\n    inflammation of mucous membranes: conjunctivitis, bronchitis,\r\n    pneumonitis. Granulomatous reaction can follow chronic inflammation of\r\n    the skin, and lesions may appear in the liver and elsewhere after long\r\n    periods of absorption from the lungs. Beryllium and its compounds are\r\n    a cause of delayed pneumonitis and pulmonary granulomas. IARC (1993)\r\n    classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as Group 1, carcinogenic\r\n    to humans, on the basis of sufficient evidence in humans and in\r\n    experimental animals. However, in epidemiological studies the\r\n    information on smoking was incomplete and the data did not rule out\r\n    the possibility that the few excess deaths observed could have been\r\n    due to smoking rather than to any other cause (Steenland & Ward, 1991,\r\n    1993; Eisenbud, 1993; MacMahon, 1994; Kotin, 1994).\r\n\r\n    The prevalence of chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is reduced in\r\n    smokers compared with non-smokers. The disease is preceded by the\r\n    development of beryllium-specific sensitization. In two studies\r\n    examining different worker populations, the prevalence of smoking in\r\n    those with clinically diagnosed CBD was lower than in those that were\r\n    sensitized but did not have the disease (Kreiss et al., 1993; Kreiss\r\n    et al., 1996). 3.4.3  Chromium\r\n\r\n    Chromium and its compounds are used in metallurgical, chemical,\r\n    electroplating and leather tanning industries (IARC, 1990). The\r\n    principal route of entry to the body is through the lungs. Chromium\r\n    ulcers of the skin and dermatitis can result from handling chromium\r\n    products and deposition of chromates on mucous membranes can also\r\n    cause ulceration which, in the nasal septum, can lead to perforation\r\n    (Lindberg & Hedenstierna, 1983; IARC, 1990). Chromium and some\r\n    chromium compounds are respiratory tract sensitizers and a cause\r\n    asthma. Hexavalent chromium salts have been associated with lung\r\n\r\n    cancer both in experimental animals and in epidemiological studies.\r\n    IARC (1990) concluded that there is sufficient evidence in humans for\r\n    the carcinogenicity of hexavalent chromium compounds as encountered in\r\n    chromate production, chromate pigment production and chromium plating\r\n    industries.\r\n\r\n    Lang\u00e5rd & Norseth (1975) suggested that cigarette smoking increases\r\n    the risk for lung cancer in workers exposed to chromate dust. Other\r\n    studies (Abe et al., 1982; Lang\u00e5rd & Vigander, 1983; Yoshizawa, 1984;\r\n    Nishiyama et al., 1985) have suggested that workers with exposure to\r\n    chromium compounds who are also smokers may be at greater risk than\r\n    non-smokers. However, the numbers were too small for conclusions on\r\n    interactions to be drawn. 3.4.4  Nickel\r\n\r\n    Exposure to nickel or its compounds occurs in mining, refining,\r\n    smelting and alloying the metal, in nickel plating and in welding. It\r\n    is used in battery manufacture, electroplating, enamelling, ceramics,\r\n    the chemical and petroleum industries and in dyestuffs and ink making.\r\n    Exposure may be by skin contact or inhalation of dusts, fumes, mists\r\n    or gaseous nickel carbonyl (IPCS, 1991a). In occupational exposure the\r\n    daily intake and absorption/retention vary widely between industries\r\n    (IARC, 1990).\r\n\r\n    Nickel is absorbed from the soil by the tobacco plant. During smoking,\r\n    up to 20% of the nickel in the tobacco is transferred to mainstream\r\n    smoke. This high transfer rate, compared to the much lower transfer\r\n    rates of other metals, has been explained by the formation of the\r\n    volatile nickel carbonyl (Sunderman & Sunderman, 1961). Nickel\r\n    carbonyl is a strong lung carcinogen in rats (IARC, 1990).\r\n\r\n    IARC (1990) evaluated the carcinogenicity of nickel and nickel\r\n    compounds and classified nickel compounds as carcinogenic to humans\r\n    (Group 1) and nickel as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In\r\n    an epidemiological study on a cohort of 916 workers in a Norwegian\r\n    nickel refinery, four work categories were defined: i) roasting and\r\n    smelting; ii) electrolysis; iii) other processes; and iv) other work\r\n    groups. All groups showed an excess risk of respiratory cancer. In the\r\n    roasting and smelting department there were excess risks for lung\r\n    cancer (O/E = 12/2.5) and nasal cavity cancer (O/E = 5/0.1). In the\r\n    electrolysis department there were also excess risks of lung cancer\r\n    (O/E = 26/3.6) and nasal cavity cancer (0/E = 6/0.2) (Pedersen et al.,\r\n    1973). Magnus et al. (1982) updated this study and found evidence of\r\n    an additive effect of smoking and nickel exposure in the induction of\r\n    respiratory cancer. Histological examination of nasal biopsy specimens\r\n    from 59 retired nickel workers, 21 of whom were smokers and snuff\r\n    users, showed a higher score of nasal epithelial dysplasia in smokers\r\n    than in non-smokers, and 4 workers with nasal carcinoma were smokers\r\n    (Boysen et al., 1984). In monitoring nickel exposure by imaging\r\n\r\n    cytometry of nasal smears (Reith et al., 1994), it was possible to\r\n    distinguish between workers who were exposed to different nickel\r\n    compounds and to distinguish between smoking and non-smoking nickel\r\n    workers. 3.4.5  Manganese\r\n\r\n    There is occupational exposure to manganese in its mining, the\r\n    ferromanganese and iron and steel industries, the production of dry\r\n    cell batteries, and the manufacture and use of welding rods. Manganese\r\n    is released by the combustion of the gasoline additive,\r\n    methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), used in some\r\n    countries. However, the amount in gasoline (approximately 10 mg/litre)\r\n    and emitted in vehicle exhausts is small and does not to lead to human\r\n    exposure (Health Canada, 1994). The principal route of entry of\r\n    manganese is through the lungs but, because most of the compounds are\r\n    insoluble, only the smallest particles, as contained in furnace and\r\n    welding fume, are capable of reaching the alveoli and being\r\n    phagocytosed and absorbed (IARC, 1986).\r\n\r\n    Manganese is present in tobacco leaves and it has been reported (IARC,\r\n    1986) that 0.003 \u00b5g of manganese appears in the mainstream smoke from\r\n    one cigarette and thus contributes to a smoker's manganese intake in\r\n    the form of small and dangerous particles.\r\n\r\n    Manganese is neurotoxic and long-term occupational exposure can cause\r\n    a condition resembling Parkinson's disease. It causes lung damage\r\n    leading to an increased incidence of pneumonia and a higher rate of\r\n    acute and chronic bronchitis. In studies of manganese alloy production\r\n    workers and chronic lung disease, smokers were more affected than\r\n    non-smokers and the relationship between the number of cigarettes\r\n    smoked and the prevalence of respiratory tract symptoms suggested that\r\n    smoking acted synergistically with manganese (Saris & Lucic-Palaic,\r\n    1977). In a study of workers producing manganese salts and oxide\r\n    (Roels et al., 1985) smoking and manganese exposure were additive in\r\n    producing preclinical toxic effects. In studies on workers producing\r\n    iron-manganese alloys, one concerned with chronic bronchitis\r\n    (Misiewicz et al., 1994) and the other with pulmonary ventilatory\r\n    disturbance (Misiewicz et al., 1992), there was no relationship\r\n    between the occupational exposure or its duration and health effects.\r\n    The chronic bronchitis and ventilatory disturbance were attributed to\r\n    cigarette smoking. 3.4.6  Platinum\r\n\r\n    Platinum is used as a catalyst in many chemical processes and in motor\r\n    vehicle exhausts. Chloroplatinic acid is an intermediate in the\r\n    preparation of a large number of complex salts, which are used in\r\n    platinum refining, the chemical industry and, therapeutically, in\r\n    cancer chemotherapy.\r\n\r\n    Platinum salt sensitivity is an IgE-mediated immune response (IPCS,\r\n    1991b). Ammonium hexachloroplatinate is used as an intermediate in\r\n    platinum refining, and its inhalation provokes asthmatic responses and\r\n    elicits immediate skin test responses in sensitized individuals (Pepys\r\n    et al., 1972). In a cohort study of 91 workers in a platinum refinery\r\n    (Venables et al., 1989), 22 developed respiratory symptoms and an\r\n    immediate skin test response to ammonium hexachloroplatinate. The risk\r\n    was greatest in the first year of employment and smokers had an\r\n    increased risk of becoming sensitized. In another study, out of 78\r\n    workers at a platinum refinery, 32 (41%) had developed platinum salts\r\n    sensitivity after 24 months of exposure and the risk of sensitization\r\n    was about 8 times greater for smokers (Calverley et al., 1995).\r\n\r\n    Baker et al. (1990) conducted a cross-sectional study of respiratory\r\n    and dermatological effects of platinum salt sensitization in 136\r\n    workers (107 current employees and 29 former employees) at a precious\r\n    metal refinery. Twenty three workers (22%) had become sensitized.\r\n    Platinum salts sensitivity was not associated with atopicity but was\r\n    strongly associated with cigarette smoking status. 3.4.7  Silica\r\n\r\n    Silicosis (lung fibrosis caused by silica) is not only a hazard of\r\n    mining. It is also found in bricklayers, cement makers, workers in\r\n    pottery, porcelain and ceramics, rock drillers, workers chipping,\r\n    grinding or polishing stone, in sandblasting, using grinding stones to\r\n    smooth or polish precious stones, metals or optical glass, and in the\r\n    manufacture of polishing materials such as metal polishes and\r\n    toothpaste. The number of industries generating silica dust is large.\r\n    The amount of respirable dust varies from one to another and, because\r\n    silica is an active adsorbent, it can become contaminated and have its\r\n    toxic potential changed. Furthermore, freshly fractured silica dust\r\n    may exhibit a different surface reactivity and cytotoxicity from that\r\n    of aged silica (Vallyathan et al., 1988).\r\n\r\n    Hnizdo & Sluis-Cremer (1991), in a study of gold miners, linked high\r\n    exposure to silica dust with lung cancer and found a combined effect\r\n    of dust and smoking that fitted a multiplicative model for lung\r\n    cancer. Amandus et al. (1992) studied lung cancer in men with\r\n    diagnosed silicosis and suggested that there was an association\r\n    between the two diseases. In a study of iron foundry workers\r\n    (Andjelkovich et al., 1994), cigarette smoking was a strong predictor\r\n    of lung cancer whereas silica exposure showed no association with the\r\n    disease.\r\n\r\n    Chronic silicosis develops after 20 to 40 years of exposure to silica\r\n    dust. There are also other types of pneumoconiosis related to the\r\n    nature of the dust, and chronic bronchitis and airways obstruction\r\n    have been associated with silica dust exposure. A hypothesis for the\r\n    pathogenesis of chronic silicosis is that silica particles are\r\n    phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages for which they have a marked\r\n    selective toxicity. Permanent macrophage activation initiates\r\n    inflammatory reactions leading to the formation of collagenous fibres.\r\n\r\n    Acute silicosis arises from the inhalation of more highly reactive\r\n    silica (Vallyathan et al., 1988). The link between silicosis and\r\n    smoking was examined in a study of smoking and silica exposure on\r\n    pulmonary epithelial permeability. Faster clearance of a radioaerosol\r\n    from the upper lung regions was found for smokers (Nery et al., 1988,\r\n    1993). The question of silica clearance was considered in an analysis\r\n    of an association between silicosis and smoking: differences in\r\n    collagenization for smokers and non-smokers were attributed to\r\n    differences in the interception of silica particulate matter by mucus\r\n    (Hessel et al., 1991). In studies by Ng et al. (1987, 1992), smoking\r\n    was not considered to affect the progression of silicosis in granite\r\n    quarry workers. However, examining the association of silicosis with\r\n    lung cancer, Ng et al. (1990) concluded that the excess lung cancer\r\n    risk in silicosis is attributable to smoking, and there appeared to be\r\n    a synergistic effect between smoking and silica/silicosis regarding\r\n    the risk of developing lung cancer.\r\n\r\n    In a study of 562 South African gold miners exposed to low levels of\r\n    dust with a high (50-70%) silica content, the incidence of chronic\r\n    bronchitis was higher than in non-dust-exposed controls. Although the\r\n    percentage of smokers was higher in those with chronic bronchitis in\r\n    both groups, there was a significant excess in the dust-exposed\r\n    smokers (Sluis-Cremer et al., 1967). The authors concluded that there\r\n    was a factor in dust-exposed smokers that increased the incidence of\r\n    chronic bronchitis above that expected from smoking alone. In a study\r\n    of 2209 South African gold miners and 483 non-miners on the effect of\r\n    silica dust and tobacco smoking on mortality from chronic obstructive\r\n    lung disease, it was found that miners who smoked and were exposed to\r\n    silica dust were at higher risk of dying from chronic obstructive lung\r\n    disease than smokers not exposed to silica dust. In South African gold\r\n    mines about 30% of the respirable dust is free silica. It was\r\n    concluded that tobacco smoking and silica dust acted synergistically\r\n    in causing chronic obstructive lung disease (Hnizdo, 1990). Hnizdo et\r\n    al. (1990) applied additive and multiplicative relative risk models to\r\n    the same sample and found that departure from additivity increased\r\n    progressively with the severity of obstructive impairment. They\r\n    concluded that tobacco smoking potentiated the effect of dust in\r\n    causing respiratory impairment and that severe respiratory impairment\r\n    could have been prevented through elimination of tobacco smoking\r\n    (Hnizdo et al., 1990). Oxman et al., (1993) analysed the relationship\r\n    between occupational dust exposure and chronic obstructive lung\r\n    disease in both gold and coal miners and found a significant\r\n    association between loss of lung function and cumulative respirable\r\n    dust exposure, which was greater in gold miners. In this study there\r\n    was no evidence of interaction with tobacco smoking for gold miners,\r\n    and the authors suggested that the increased risk of lung function\r\n    loss was due to exposure to dust having a higher silica content than\r\n    coal dust. Among iron ore miners in Sweden, J\u00f6rgensen et al. (1988)\r\n    found a strong relationship between chronic bronchitis and smoking,\r\n    but not with working underground. The two risk factors, silica dust\r\n    and smoking, appeared to be additive but the smoking effect was far\r\n    greater than that of silica dust. In a study of small airway disease\r\n    in patients with silica dust exposure, with and without radiographic\r\n\r\n    evidence of silicosis, and smoking, Avolio et al. (1986) found no\r\n    differences in lung function and prevalence of small airways disease\r\n    with silicosis. However, in both groups small airway disease was\r\n    significantly related to tobacco smoking, indicating that this had a\r\n    more powerful effect than silicosis. 3.5  Organic chemical agents Many organic compounds with properties covering a wide spectrum of\r\n    molecular structure and biological activity are encountered in a\r\n    variety of industries. The effects of a few compounds, some of which\r\n    are encountered in specific industries, and smoking have been studied.\r\n    Where organic compounds occur in both tobacco smoke and the workplace,\r\n    the effect of smoking becomes one of dose augmentation, although\r\n    modification of effect can also occur. Some organic compounds would\r\n    normally not be found in tobacco smoke but are present because\r\n    workplace materials have contaminated smoking materials and they are\r\n    then pyrolysed or volatilized during smoking. 3.5.1  Chloromethyl ethers\r\n\r\n    Chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) and its contaminant bis(chloromethyl)\r\n    ether (BCME) are used in the synthetic chemical industry, in the\r\n    manufacture of ion exchange resins and in polymer production. They are\r\n    carcinogenic when inhaled, BCME more so than CMME. In a long-term\r\n    study of chemical workers, 93 had exposure to chloromethyl ethers and\r\n    22 died from lung cancer. Of 32 workers who had no exposure, 3 died\r\n    from lung cancer (Weiss & Boucot, 1975; Weiss, 1976, 1980, 1982). For\r\n    the 22 cases in of lung cancer in the exposed workers, a dose-response\r\n    relationship was established. In the groups with heavy occupational\r\n    exposure, there were fewer heavy smokers (&gt20 cigarettes per day)\r\n    than in the groups with lower occupational exposure. This\r\n    statistically significant shift might be explained by self-selection\r\n    of heavy smokers out of the high occupational exposure groups because\r\n    of the bronchial irritation that is caused by the exposure to\r\n    chloromethyl ethers, or cigarette smoking might have an antagonistic\r\n    activity (Steenland & Thun, 1986; Thomas & Whittemore, 1988; Weiss &\r\n    Nash, 1997). 3.5.2  Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride\r\n\r\n    Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA) is used as an epoxy resin curing\r\n    agent. It is respiratory tract sensitizer and causes asthma (Schlueter\r\n    et al., 1978). In a study using a radio allergosorbent test with a\r\n    TCPA human serum albumin conjugate, specific IgE antibody was detected\r\n    in serum from 24 out of 300 factory floor workers exposed to TCPA. Of\r\n    these 24, 20 (83%) were current smokers, compared with 133 (48%) of\r\n    276 without antibody (p&lt0.01), and there was a weaker association\r\n    with atopy, defined by skin tests with common allergens. Smoking and\r\n    atopy interacted, the prevalence of antibody being 16% in atopic\r\n    smokers, 12% in non-atopic smokers, 8% in atopic non-smokers and none\r\n\r\n    in the non-atopic non-smokers. It was concluded that smoking may\r\n    predispose to, and interact with atopy in the production of specific\r\n    IgE antibody to this hapten protein conjugate. 3.5.3  Dyestuffs\r\n\r\n    There is an established relationship between bladder cancer and\r\n    exposure to certain aromatic amines encountered in the dyestuffs\r\n    industry, e.g., benzidine, 4-aminobiphenyl and 2-naphthylamine (IARC,\r\n    1987), and smoking is causally associated with bladder cancer (IARC,\r\n    1986; US Surgeon General, 1989). From an analysis of 991 cases by\r\n    Cartwright (1982), a significant risk of bladder cancer was associated\r\n    with cigarette smoking, and a dose-response relationship, based on\r\n    years of employment, was found in workers in dyestuffs manufacturing.\r\n    The risks were considered to be additive. Overall, there was a\r\n    significant risk of bladder cancer associated with cigarette smoking,\r\n    a risk ratio of 1.8 for males, and there were significant overall\r\n    risks associated with occupations such as those of process workers in\r\n    the dye manufacturing industry who had a risk of 2.9 for males. When\r\n    dye manufacturing process workers who were smokers were compared with\r\n    non-smoking workers, the risk for smokers was 4.6, while for\r\n    non-smokers the risk was 1.9.\r\n\r\n    Boyko et al. (1985) concluded that arylamines in the dyestuffs\r\n    industry posed a major threat of bladder cancer. However, there was\r\n    little evidence to support an effect due to smoking or an interaction\r\n    between smoking and occupational exposure.\r\n\r\n    In an area of Spain where 44% of the adult population worked in dyeing\r\n    and printing textile fabrics, there was an increased risk of bladder\r\n    cancer for smokers (OR 2.3) (Gonzalez et al., 1985). The estimated\r\n    risks for occupation and for smoking and occupational exposure were OR\r\n    5.5 and 11.7, respectively. The observed effect was multiplicative.\r\n    Tobacco smoke contains many amines, including the bladder carcinogens\r\n    4-aminobiphenyl (&gt9 ng/cigarette) and 2-naphthylamine (54\r\n    ng/cigarette) (Patrianakos & Hoffmann, 1979; Pieraccini et al., 1992;\r\n    Grimmer et al., 1995).\r\n\r\n    In a study of risk factors for bladder cancer in Spain (Bravo et al.,\r\n    1987), the results were considered to corroborate previous data that\r\n    bladder cancer does not have a single cause. Cigarette smoking was\r\n    considered an important cause but one which was additional to\r\n    urological disease or occupational exposure, among other factors. In a\r\n    study of men in Spain (Gonzalez et al., 1989), increased risks of\r\n    bladder cancer were found for textile workers (OR 1.97), mechanics and\r\n    maintenance workers (OR 1.86), and workers in the printing industry\r\n    (OR 2.06). The highest risk was in those who were employed in the\r\n    textile industry before the age of 25 and prior to 1960. Among\r\n    mechanics the highest risk was for those who started after the age of\r\n    25 and after 1960. The OR for smokers who had also been employed in\r\n    one of the high-risk occupations was 7.82, which is compatible with a\r\n    multiplicative effect of joint exposure to tobacco smoke and\r\n    occupational hazards. In an Italian study (D'Avanzo et al., 1990),\r\n\r\n    risk additivity was found for the interaction between tobacco smoke\r\n    and several occupations associated with bladder cancer but the\r\n    occupations were not specified. The bladder cancer risk for smokers of\r\n    black tobacco was higher (OR = 3.7) compared with smokers of blond\r\n    tobacco cigarettes (OR = 2.6). A higher risk for black tobacco than\r\n    for blond varieties and a protective effect for smokers of tipped\r\n    cigarettes was also reported in a study in Northern Italy where a\r\n    multiplicative effect for smoking and high risk occupations was also\r\n    found (Vineis et al., 1984).\r\n\r\n    Bartsch et al. (1993) correlated the higher incidence of bladder\r\n    cancer among smokers of black tobacco with high yield aromatic amines,\r\n    particularly 4-aminobiphenyl from black tobacco (5 times greater than\r\n    from blond tobacco). The concentrations of urinary mutagens and of\r\n    4-aminobiphenyl adducts in the blood were also higher in smokers of\r\n    black tobacco.\r\n\r\n    A Chinese study of bladder cancer incidence and mortality in workers\r\n    with benzidine exposure found a marked dose response and an elevated\r\n    risk for both producers and users of benzidine. Workers exposed to\r\n    benzidine who were smokers had a 31-fold risk, while the risk for\r\n    exposed workers who were non-smokers was 11-fold, and a multiplicative\r\n    interaction was suggested (Bi et al., 1992). 3.5.4  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\r\n\r\n    Tobacco smoke contains many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\r\n    (IARC, 1986), a number of which, such as benz( a)pyrene and\r\n    dibenz( a,h)anthracene, are known to be carcinogenic (IARC, 1987;\r\n    Hoffmann & Hoffmann, 1997). PAHs are generated by incomplete\r\n    combustion of organic matter in many industrial processes and\r\n    constitute a hazard not only in occupations but also as environmental\r\n    pollutants, representing primary risk factors as lung and bladder\r\n    carcinogens. A tobacco smoker can obtain one dose of PAHs from tobacco\r\n    smoke and another from the industrial or environmental source.\r\n    Furthermore, an interaction of tobacco smoke and an occupational\r\n    hazard is a possibility. PAHs in the workplace are often accompanied\r\n    by many other toxic compounds, particularly irritants, and, in\r\n    addition to carcinogenic PAHs, tobacco smoke contains co-carcinogens\r\n    and tumour promoters as well as ciliatoxic agents, irritants and other\r\n    biologically active species.\r\n\r\n    PAHs occur in coal gas manufacture, coking oven fumes, aluminium\r\n    smelting, in the use of tar and asphalt, in oil refining and the\r\n    exhaust from internal combustion engines. They are frequently\r\n    accompanied by irritant fumes or aerosols and potentially harmful\r\n    particulate matter. There is a lack of smoking data for workers in\r\n    many of these industries, but it has been assumed that the smoking\r\n    prevalence is at least as high as the average for blue collar workers.\r\n    At a Norwegian smelter 69% of workers were smokers when the expected\r\n    prevalence of smoking was 52% (Abramson et al., 1989). The percentage\r\n\r\n    of smokers and ex-smokers among workers exposed to chemicals and coal\r\n    tar pitch in a 1982 survey of 800 000 men and women in the USA was\r\n    49.9% against 46.1% for the average worker (Stellman et al., 1988).\r\n\r\n    A Canadian study found a high prevalence of bladder cancer in\r\n    aluminium smelter workers, particularly among those employed in\r\n    S\u00f6derberg potrooms where carbon electrodes made from a mixture of\r\n    petroleum pitch and coal pitch are used and PAH levels are high\r\n    (Th\u00e9riault et al., 1984). Changing electrodes, breaking the crust that\r\n    forms on top of the molten metal and cleaning out the \"pots\" are\r\n    activities that create air pollution by tar volatiles including\r\n    carcinogenic PAHs which, measured as benzo( a)pyrene, could reach a\r\n    concentration of 800 \u00b5g/m3/8 h (Bjorseth et al., 1978). High levels\r\n    of PAHs were found in urine samples from aluminium plant workers\r\n    (Haugen et al., 1986). Lung cancer rates among aluminium reduction\r\n    plant workers are also high (Gibbs & Horowitz, 1979). Tobacco smoke\r\n    appears to increase the risk. In a study by Th\u00e9riault et al. (1984),\r\n    the numbers were too small to determine whether the interaction was\r\n    additive or multiplicative, but in another study (Bjorseth et al.,\r\n    1978) there was suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that the\r\n    relative risks from combined exposure to tar volatiles and cigarette\r\n    smoke were multiplicative. In a study in which the preceding data were\r\n    augmented (Armstrong et al., 1986), the tar volatiles were confirmed\r\n    as the cause of bladder cancer and the results suggested that a\r\n    multiplicative risk arose from a combined exposure to tar volatiles\r\n    and cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\n    Gullv\u00e5g et al. (1985) found that the alveolar macrophage count for\r\n    workers in the potrooms of an aluminium reduction plant was elevated\r\n    and for workers who were also smokers the count was further elevated.\r\n    The conclusion was that smoking and workplace pollution act\r\n    synergistically in increasing the number of alveolar macrophages.\r\n\r\n    Workers in coke oven plants have a higher incidence of lung cancer\r\n    than the general population and a measurable concentration of PAHs in\r\n    urine, which is higher in smokers than non-smokers (Haugen et al.,\r\n    1986). Van Schooten et al. (1990) analysed blood samples from coke\r\n    oven workers for PAH-DNA adducts and urine for 1-hydroxypyrene and\r\n    compared the results with those of non-exposed workers. Levels were\r\n    elevated in coke oven workers and in both exposed and control groups\r\n    the PAH-DNA adduct levels were higher among smokers than among\r\n    non-smokers.\r\n\r\n    Professional drivers are exposed to benzene and carcinogenic PAHs and\r\n    nitroarenes through the exhaust of petrol (gasoline) and,\r\n    particularly, diesel engines. An excess of lung cancer has been found\r\n    in this occupational group, with a suggestion of a synergistic\r\n    interaction between smoking and occupational exposure (Damber &\r\n    Larsson, 1985a).\r\n\r\n    Diesel exhaust contains large quantities of carbonaceous particulates\r\n    with adsorbed PAHs. The association between lung cancer and diesel\r\n    exhaust and the contributing role of cigarette smoking has been\r\n\r\n    considered to be problematic (Garshick et al., 1987, 1988; Boffetta et\r\n    al., 1988; St\u00f6ber & Abel, 1996; IPCS, 1996). In its evaluation, IARC\r\n    (IARC, 1989c) considered diesel engine exhaust to be probably\r\n    carcinogenic to humans (group 2A) and gasoline engine exhaust as being\r\n    possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B).\r\n\r\n    In most of the workplaces where PAHs contaminate the atmosphere, there\r\n    are also gases, fumes and aerosols that contain other hazardous\r\n    materials that act as irritants; they may play a role in the etiology\r\n    of chronic obstructive lung disease. It is important to include\r\n    smoking in epidemiological studies. In a study of lung cancer\r\n    mortality rates and smoking patterns in workers in the motor vehicle\r\n    industry, proportionate mortality rates were considerably reduced when\r\n    smoking rates were taken into account. An increased lung cancer risk\r\n    has been described among foundry workers; PAHs and silica were\r\n    considered to be possible etiological factors (Sherson et al., 1992).\r\n    IARC (IARC, 1984, 1985b) considers the following technical products as\r\n    carcinogenic to humans: coal tar and coal tar pitches, shale oils,\r\n    soots, effluent aerosols from coal gasification, and emissions from\r\n    coke ovens. Exposure occurring in the production of aluminium is\r\n    classified as probably carcinogenic to humans, whereas the exposures\r\n    to aerosol emissions from iron and steel foundries are classified as\r\n    possibly carcinogenic to humans. 3.5.5  Ethanol\r\n\r\n    Clinical and epidemiological studies have established a strong\r\n    relationship between smoking and drinking (Istvan & Matarazzo, 1984;\r\n    Bien & Burge, 1990; Zacny, 1990).\r\n\r\n    Elevated tobacco and alcohol consumption are regarded as the major\r\n    risk factors for oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancer in many\r\n    developed countries (Herity et al., 1982; Tuyns, 1983, 1991; Boyle et\r\n    al., 1990; Muir & McKinney, 1992; Negri et al., 1992).\r\n\r\n    It has been difficult to distinguish the separate effects of these\r\n    agents since many smokers tend to consume alcoholic beverages and vice versa. In addition, the consumption of one substance may have\r\n    an effect on the use of the other substance. The possible interactions\r\n    (e.g., multiplicative effect) of tobacco smoking and alcohol\r\n    consumption for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx have\r\n    been evaluated by IARC (1986). IARC (1986) concluded that tobacco\r\n    smoking was an important cause of oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal,\r\n    laryngeal and oesophageal cancers and combined ethanol consumption\r\n    increased the risk substantially. In a case control study of 1114\r\n    patients with oropharyngeal cancer, Blot et al. (1988) showed that the\r\n    risk to consumers of tobacco and alcohol was multiplicative rather\r\n    than additive and increased 35-fold in those who consumed two or more\r\n    packs of cigarettes and more than four alcoholic drinks per day. The\r\n    risk was higher in those consuming spirits or beer than in those\r\n    consuming wine and was lower in lifetime smokers of filter cigarettes.\r\n\r\n    Alcohol consumption and smoking affect fetal outcome, leading to\r\n    infants with low birth weight (Wright et al., 1983, 1984; Smith et\r\n    al., 1986).\r\n\r\n    In contrast to the many studies in laboratory animals of the\r\n    interactions of ethanol with tobacco-smoke condensate (TSC) and\r\n    specific tobacco constituents, e.g., nicotine (receptor studies)\r\n    (Collins, 1990), (gastric-mucosal damage) (Wong et al., 1986; Cho et\r\n    al., 1990), tobacco-smoke-specific nitrosamines, e.g., N-nitrosonornicotine (metabolism and carcinogenicity) (McCoy et al.,\r\n    1981; Castonguay et al., 1983, 1984) and\r\n    4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) (Jorquera et al.,\r\n    1992; Sch\u00fcller et al., 1993), there has been a relative paucity of\r\n    studies involving ethanol and tobacco smoke per se. These latter\r\n    studies have included fetotoxicity in mice (Peterson et al., 1981),\r\n    gastric mucosal damage (Iwata et al., 1995; Chow et al., 1996), and\r\n    mechanisms underlying behavioural association between alcohol and\r\n    tobacco consumption (Zacny, 1990).\r\n\r\n    In in vitro studies on the effect of tobacco smoke condensate on rat\r\n    buccal mucosa cells following exposure to ethanol, the level of\r\n    adducts was higher than in controls, suggesting an increased uptake of\r\n    carcinogens in the condensate (Autrup et al., 1992). Hsu et al. (1991)\r\n    studied in vitro genotoxicity of tobacco smoke condensate in\r\n    conjunction with 2% and 4% ethanol in human lymphoid cell lines.\r\n    Ethanol potentiated clastogenicity, measured by frequency of\r\n    chromosome breaks per cell, in a dose-dependent manner, and the\r\n    results indicated that ethanol at relatively high doses inhibited DNA\r\n    and chromosome repair systems.\r\n\r\n    Swiss Albino mice fetuses prenatally exposed to both tobacco smoke and\r\n    ethanol had a high resorption frequency, a significant reduction in\r\n    fetal weight and length, and neonatal growth retardation, indicating\r\n    that ethanol and tobacco smoke may interact to produce fetotoxicity\r\n    (Peterson et al., 1981).\r\n\r\n    Both cigarette smoking and ethanol consumption individually have been\r\n    associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers in humans and animals.\r\n    Exposure to cigarette smoke significantly potentiated ethanol-induced\r\n    gastric mucosal damage in Sprague-Dawley rats (Iwata et al., 1995;\r\n    Chow et al., 1996).\r\n\r\n    The effect of smoking on the incidence of cancers of the oral cavity,\r\n    oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx is often combined with other\r\n    factors, principally alcohol, in the Western world. The possibility of\r\n    interaction between cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption is\r\n    complex (Burch et al., 1981).\r\n\r\n    Rothman & Keller (1972) reviewed the effect of joint exposure to\r\n    tobacco and alcohol with regard to oral cancers alone (based on data\r\n    published earlier by Keller & Terris, 1965) and concluded that a\r\n\r\n    single multiplicative function of the relative risks associated with\r\n    alcohol and tobacco separately provided an adequate summary of their\r\n    joint effect.\r\n\r\n    Wynder & Bross (1961) studied etiological factors in cancer of the\r\n    oesophagus, considered the consumption and effects of tobacco and\r\n    alcohol separately and together, and considered that the combined\r\n    effect was multiplicative. Tuyns et al. (1977) reported a similar\r\n    pattern of joint effect of tobacco and alcohol in a retrospective\r\n    study of oesophageal cancer in Brittany, France. The relative risk of\r\n    developing oesophageal cancer increased linearly with daily\r\n    consumption of alcohol and tobacco independently. The combined effect\r\n    fitted a multiplicative model.\r\n\r\n    Wynder et al. (1976) analysed environmental factors in cancer of the\r\n    larynx and showed a combined effect of tobacco and alcohol. In the\r\n    presence of smoking, heavy drinking increased the risk of cancer of\r\n    the larynx, especially for cancer of the supraglottic portion of the\r\n    larynx. Similar findings were reported by Burch et al. (1981).\r\n\r\n    In a prospective epidemiological study, the relative risk of incurring\r\n    a single primary carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and\r\n    oesophagus in any one of these sites was increased independently by\r\n    the duration and intensity of exposure to tobacco or alcohol and\r\n    sustained exposure enhanced the risk in a multiplicative or\r\n    synergistic fashion (Schottenfeld et al., 1974) The relative risk of\r\n    multiple primary cancers in the sub-group with combined exposures to\r\n    high levels of tobacco and alcohol was 3.9 times that of patients\r\n    exposed previously to low levels of alcohol and tobacco. 3.5.6  Other organic compounds\r\n\r\n    Exposure situations involving compounds and mixtures of organic\r\n    compounds for which no definite smoking interactions have been\r\n    established but which are known to present serious health hazards are\r\n    summarized in chapter 4. 3.6  Physical agents 3.6.1  Radiation\r\n\r\n    The harmful forms of ionizing radiation that are of concern are\r\n    alpha- and beta-particles and gamma- and X-rays. All cause cellular\r\n    damage and have been implicated in carcinogenesis. IARC (1988)\r\n    classified radon and its decay products as Group 1 (carcinogenic to\r\n    humans) on the basis of sufficient evidence in humans and in\r\n    laboratory animals. The interaction of the effects of these radiations\r\n    with the effects of tobacco smoke has been studied. Radium is present\r\n    in uranium and other minerals and in all rocks and soils. It emits\r\n    alpha- and beta-particles and gamma-rays and decays to form the\r\n    chemically inert radioactive gas radon, which is released in tiny\r\n    amounts into the atmosphere where its concentration is extremely small\r\n    because of dilution. It can, however, become more concentrated in some\r\n\r\n    locations, particularly in uranium and other mines and in residential\r\n    buildings. Radon is an inspirable gas and its radioactive decay\r\n    products are ionized metal atoms, which adhere to inspirable dust\r\n    particles. These atoms are themselves undergoing radioactive decay and\r\n    emitting damaging alpha- and beta-particles and gamma-rays. In\r\n    addition to interactions of tobacco smoke with radon in mines and\r\n    residential situations, other effects of tobacco smoke and radiation\r\n    interactions have been studied in atom-bomb survivors and in the low\r\n    energy transfer radiation involved in the use of therapeutic radiation\r\n    (X-rays).\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.1  Radon in mines (high linear energy transfer (LET)\r\n             alpha-radiation)\r\n\r\n    Unless mines are well ventilated, the atmospheric concentration of\r\n    radon becomes significant. The gas and its radioactive decay products,\r\n    the radon daughters, can be inhaled. The daughters have short\r\n    half-lives and their decay is proceeding while the particles to which\r\n    they adhere are resident in the lungs and before they can be removed\r\n    by normal lung clearance. Thus radiation is delivered directly to the\r\n    delicate lung tissues where it causes an excess of lung cancer among\r\n    some miners.\r\n\r\n    Observations in several mining communities, e.g., among uranium miners\r\n    in the USA, Czechoslovakia, Canada and France, workers in a niobium\r\n    mine in Norway, iron ore miners in Sweden, tin miners in China and the\r\n    United Kingdom, and fluorspar miners in Newfoundland, showed a\r\n    significant dose-related increase in lung cancer risk with exposure to\r\n    radon and radon daughter elements (Archer, 1988). In miners who were\r\n    cigarette smokers, there was an interaction between the radiation\r\n    exposure and the smoke exposure leading to more than the expected\r\n    number of cases of cancer. The latent period for induction of lung\r\n    cancer was longer when the exposure to radioactivity started at a\r\n    younger age, it was shortened by high exposure rates and by cigarette\r\n    smoking, and lung cancers developed at lower levels of exposure to\r\n    radioactivity in miners who smoked than in those who were non-smokers.\r\n    In Bulgaria, Michaylov et al. (1995) used sputum cytology to study\r\n    bronchial cell dysplasia in 334 miners (uranium and metal mines)\r\n    exposed to 222Rn progeny, and 100 control miners from a metal mine\r\n    where radon was virtually absent. The dust and silica concentrations\r\n    and exposure to diesel exhaust and explosion gases were similar. The\r\n    frequency of bronchial cell dysplasia was significantly higher in\r\n    radon-exposed miners than in controls and the frequency of dysplasia\r\n    in smokers was significantly greater than in non-smokers.\r\n\r\n    The lower prevalence of lung cancer among coal miners than among other\r\n    underground workers is probably because coal mines are well ventilated\r\n    to reduce fire and explosion risk, and no build up of radioactivity\r\n    occurs. Attempts to reduce silicosis by ventilation have achieved a\r\n    similar effect. In some Swedish mines, because freezing occurred when\r\n    outside air was used for ventilation, filtration was achieved in the\r\n    1920s by circulating the air through old underground mine workings,\r\n    with the result that the potential for silicosis was reduced. However,\r\n\r\n    an increase in lung cancer was found because radioactive materials\r\n    built up, a fact that only became evident many years later (Archer,\r\n    1988).\r\n\r\n    The nature of the interaction between radon and cigarette smoke is not\r\n    clear. In a study by Edling (1982), the effects of smoking and radon\r\n    were considered to be additive, whereas in another by Damber & Larsson\r\n    (1985b) the effect was multiplicative. From a long-term study on\r\n    Swedish iron ore miners (J\u00f6rgensen, 1984), it was concluded that\r\n    tobacco smoke acts as a tumour promoter, an effect that has been\r\n    demonstrated in almost all animal studies. The concept that radon\r\n    serves as a tumour initiator and tobacco smoke as the tumour promoter\r\n    for the induction and development of lung cancer is supported by a\r\n    sequence of studies. Tobacco contains small amounts of polonium-210\r\n    (210Po), which primarily originates from phosphate fertilizers (Tso et\r\n    al., 1966) and, to a minor extent, from airborne 210Po trapped by the\r\n    glandular hairs (trichomes) found on the soil-facing surfaces of\r\n    tobacco leaves (Martell, 1974). 210Po is a decay product of radon -222\r\n    and an emitter of alpha-particles. It is present in cigarette smoke,\r\n    and the bronchial epithelium of smokers contains 2-10 times more 210Po\r\n    than is found in these tissues in non-smokers (Harley et al., 1980).\r\n    The alpha-radiation of 210Po damages DNA in the bronchial airways and\r\n    serves as a tumour inhibitor, and the tar in the tobacco smoke acts as\r\n    a tumour promoter.\r\n\r\n    The frequencies of different histological types of lung cancer among\r\n    miners have varied with working conditions and follow-up time. It has\r\n    also been shown (Archer, 1988) that the age range of the population\r\n    under observation can influence the conclusion. Thus, the \r\n    smoking-radon relationship appears to be multiplicative only for the \r\n    group aged 35-65 years. Steenland (1994) found the death rates from \r\n    lung cancer in smoking uranium miners to be intermediate between \r\n    additive and multiplicative for the two exposures, but, when \r\n    stratified for age, the multiplicative model fitted well for the \r\n    youngest and oldest categories but poorly for the middle range. In a \r\n    comprehensive analysis of data from 11 studies of radon-induced health\r\n    risks (Lubin et al., 1995), it was concluded that the joint effect of \r\n    radon progeny exposure and smoking is greater than the sum of the \r\n    individual effects and for smokers is higher by a factor of at least \r\n    three. The tobacco of cigarettes contains 0.1-1.0 pCi of 210Po \r\n    (Cohen et al., 1985; Hoffmann et al., 1986).\r\n\r\n    The conclusion reached by the US Surgeon General (1985) was that the\r\n    smoking-radon interaction consists of two parts: an additive effect of\r\n    the contribution of the two agents on the number of tumours produced\r\n    and an accelerating effect due to tumour promoters in cigarette smoke.\r\n    Thus for a miner who smokes, not only is the chance of lung cancer\r\n    greater but the latent period is shorter and therefore the cancer\r\n    appears sooner in smokers.\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.2  Environmental radon (high linear energy transfer (LET)\r\n             alpha-radiation)\r\n\r\n    Alpha-radiation from radon daughters in the home or in other\r\n    situations where there are enclosed spaces with poor ventilation,\r\n    e.g., where strict energy conservation measures have been adopted,\r\n    presents an elevated health hazard to occupants, particularly smokers,\r\n    and is a matter of public health concern. The ease with which ionized\r\n    radon daughters could be attracted to environmental tobacco smoke\r\n    particles and the possibility of a higher than additive combined\r\n    effect of radon progeny and smoke clearly indicate the importance of\r\n    residential contamination by radon.\r\n\r\n    The relative risk in the range of exposure experienced by miners has\r\n    been found to be linear, and it has been suggested from extrapolation\r\n    that exposures at the lower levels found in homes would carry some\r\n    risk (Lubin et al., 1995). Steindorf et al. (1995) calculated that 7%\r\n    of all lung cancer deaths in the western part of Germany may be due to\r\n    residential radon.\r\n\r\n    Axelson (1995) reviewed cancer risks from exposure to radon in the\r\n    home and suggested that cancers other than lung cancer may also be\r\n    related to indoor radon, especially leukaemia, kidney cancer and\r\n    malignant melanoma. However, it was acknowledged that studies of radon\r\n    and miners gave no clear support for this. Alavanja et al. (1995)\r\n    listed other risk factors as being responsible for lung cancer in\r\n    lifetime non-smokers and found a small non-significant risk for\r\n    subjects exposed to domestic radon at median concentrations. In a\r\n    case-control study of lung cancer in relation to exposure to radon in\r\n    homes (Letourneau et al., 1994), no increase in the relative risk for\r\n    any of the histological types of lung cancer was detected in relation\r\n    to cumulative exposure to radon. On the other hand, Biberman et al.\r\n    (1993) found an increased risk for small cell lung cancer following\r\n    residential long-term exposure to radon at a low-dose level. In a\r\n    large case-control study in Sweden, Pershagen et al. (1994) reported\r\n    an increased relative risk of lung cancer within the highest exposure\r\n    group. In an attempt to resolve the conflicting epidemiological data,\r\n    Lubin & Boice (1997) conducted a meta-analysis of eight large-scale\r\n    case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer. This\r\n    analysis was consistent with an excess lung cancer risk. Furthermore,\r\n    the slope of the exposure- response curve derived from this\r\n    meta-analysis was comparable with that obtained from a combined\r\n    analysis of eleven miner cohorts exposed to radon (Lubin et al.,\r\n    1997).\r\n\r\n    The combined analysis of the miner data also confirmed the strong\r\n    synergistic relationship between radon and tobacco at high levels of\r\n    exposure to these two agents (Lubin et al., 1997), although it is\r\n    difficult to determine whether the interaction is closer to additive\r\n    or multiplicative (Chaffey & Bowie, 1994). When extrapolated to lower\r\n    levels of exposure, however, the magnitude of this interaction is\r\n    substantially diminished (Moolgavkar et al., 1993). However, Pershagen\r\n    et al. (1994) reported some evidence of a synergistic effect between\r\n\r\n    tobacco and residential radon exposure, with the relative risk of\r\n    radon-induced lung cancer being highest among heavy smokers. In a\r\n    case-control study of 982 subjects with lung cancer and 3185 hospital\r\n    or population control subjects, lung cancer risk was examined in\r\n    relation to residential radon concentration and length of time that\r\n    subjects were resident, and adjusted for age, sex and smoking (Darby\r\n    et al., 1998). The relative risk increased in an exposure-related\r\n    manner with time-weighted residential radon concentration and fitted\r\n    the data from studies in miners and the effect of smoking. Regardless\r\n    of the magnitude of any interaction between tobacco smoking and\r\n    residential radon, the lung cancer risks due to smoking exceed the\r\n    risk associated with radon in homes.\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.3  Atomic bomb site radiation (low linear energy transfer (LET)\r\n             radiation)\r\n\r\n    In tobacco-smoking survivors of atomic bombing in Hiroshima and\r\n    Nagasaki, Japan, elevated levels of cancer of several sites have been\r\n    reported. In the case of lung cancer both additive and multiplicative\r\n    models fit the data (Prentice et al., 1983; US NRC, 1988).\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.4  Therapeutic X-rays (low linear energy transfer (LET)\r\n             radiation)\r\n\r\n    Lung cancer as a possible side effect of the radiation therapy used to\r\n    treat breast cancer has been studied by Neugut et al. (1993, 1994) and\r\n    discussed by Inskip & Boice (1994). Neugut et al. (1993) reported that\r\n    the risk was greater in the ipsilateral than in the contralateral\r\n    lung. In a second study (Neugut et al., 1994), a three-fold relative\r\n    risk was found for the effect of radiation therapy among 10-year\r\n    survivors, a 14-fold risk was associated with smoking alone, and a\r\n    33-fold risk was found among irradiated smokers; in each case the\r\n    effect was most pronounced for ipsilateral lung cancer. A\r\n    multiplicative interaction was proposed and the implications of the\r\n    results for the design of treatment of breast cancer in smokers was\r\n    considered. The increased risk of lung cancer among survivors of\r\n    Hodgkin's disease(HD) was studied by van Leeuwen et al. (1995). Their\r\n    overall conclusions were that the risk of lung cancer increased more\r\n    with increasing radiation dose in HD patients who smoked than among\r\n    those who did not smoke. Thus, smokers were at greater risk from the\r\n    radiotherapy than non-smokers. The interaction between the\r\n    carcinogenic effects of smoking and radiation was significantly\r\n    stronger than multiplicative, and the low lung cancer rate found among\r\n    women with HD was attributable to the delayed popularity of smoking\r\n    among Dutch women, a fact shown by the male/female lung cancer ratio\r\n    (13:5) in the Netherlands in 1980.\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.5  Nuclear plant\r\n\r\n    Ongoing epidemiological studies are being conducted on the workforce\r\n    exposed to radiation at the Mayak plant in Russia. Of 500 workers\r\n    examined in a case-control study (Tokarskaya et al., 1995), 162\r\n\r\n    workers had contracted lung cancer, and the remaining 338 served as\r\n    radiation-exposed, non-tumour-bearing controls. Both the incidence and\r\n    duration of smoking was significantly higher in workers contracting\r\n    tumours compared to combined male and female controls. The strongest\r\n    smoking-related effect was for squamous cell carcinomas, followed by\r\n    adenocarcinomas, then small cell carcinomas. However, the findings are\r\n    complicated by the fact that the great majority of the workforce was\r\n    male, and there was only one of the 148 \"never smokers\" among the male\r\n    lung cancer cases.\r\n\r\n    3.6.1.6  Summary\r\n\r\n    In summary, miners subjected to chronic exposure throughout a working\r\n    lifetime to high-LET radiation show a radiation/tobacco smoke\r\n    interaction greater than additive and sometimes multiplicative. Atomic\r\n    bomb survivors exposed instantaneously to low-LET radiation show in\r\n    some cases an additive and in others a multiplicative interaction. The\r\n    results for residentially exposed smokers, subjected to a lifetime of\r\n    very low dose exposure, tend to show similar interactions to those for\r\n    miners. Tobacco-smoking patients subjected to therapeutic radiation\r\n    (low-LET) show a multiplicative interaction. 3.6.2  Vibration\r\n\r\n    Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic disorder that produces\r\n    intermittent attacks of blanching in the extremities and there may be\r\n    numbness or tingling in the hands and fingers. There are several\r\n    causes (the term \"Raynaud's disease\" is applied when the cause is not\r\n    known). It was first associated with the use of vibrating tools among\r\n    Italian miners in 1911, and the association has since been reported\r\n    for a wide range of hand-held vibrating tools such as impact hammers,\r\n    chipping hammers, grinders, riveters and the motor-driven chain-saws\r\n    used in forestry. The terms vibration white finger (VWF), vibration\r\n    syndrome, traumatic vasospastic disease and dead finger have been used\r\n    for this condition that begins with numbness and tingling, followed by\r\n    blanching and can include intermittent episodes of hand and finger\r\n    pain and flushing. With continuing exposure to vibration the symptoms\r\n    may become more severe and continue after the cessation of exposure.\r\n    Damage to digital arteries and narrowing of the lumen has been\r\n    associated with vibration syndrome (JOM, 1984) and, because nicotine\r\n    acts as a vasoconstrictor, it has been suggested (JOM, 1984) that\r\n    limiting smoking could aid blood flow to the extremities and thus\r\n    reduce the condition. In a survey of forestry workers in Quebec in\r\n    1977-1978 (Th\u00e9riault et al., 1982), a prevalence of Raynaud's\r\n    phenomenon among 1540 woodcutters was found in 30.5% of chain-saw\r\n    users and there was a strong association between this and cigarette\r\n    smoking; the relative risks were 3.60 for non-smokers, 6.55 for\r\n    smokers and 1.72 for smokers who had not used a chain-saw:\r\n    corresponding to an additive effect for the two risk factors. From\r\n    another study of the effect of tobacco use on a cohort of men with\r\n    VWF, in which the extent of tobacco use was confirmed by blood\r\n    nicotine and cotinine measurements (Ekenvall & Lindblad, 1989), it was\r\n\r\n    shown that tobacco aggravates the symptoms of VWF. Patients with\r\n    advanced symptoms were found to use tobacco more frequently and to\r\n    have higher blood cotinine levels than patients with less advanced\r\n    disease. In a study of the prognosis of VWF (Petersen et al., 1995),\r\n    an improvement in the condition occurred when there was no exposure to\r\n    either vibration or smoking, whereas an aggravation of the condition\r\n    was most notable in smokers. Whole-body vibration has been associated\r\n    with persistent severe neck trouble, and smoking was an added\r\n    predictor for this condition (Viikari-Juntura et al., 1994). Finger\r\n    temperature changes have been measured after smoking a cigarette; in\r\n    all cases a reduction in temperature was recorded (Saumet et al.,1986;\r\n    Bornmyr & Svensson, 1991). 3.6.3  Noise\r\n\r\n    In a study of aviators in 1963 at the US Naval Aerospace Medical\r\n    Research Laboratory (Thomas et al., 1981), two hearing level groups\r\n    were identified, one with normal and the other with impaired hearing.\r\n    The impaired hearing group had smoked more cigarettes for a longer\r\n    period of time than had those in the normal hearing group. In another\r\n    study the relationship between cigarette smoking and hearing loss was\r\n    studied in 2348 noise-exposed workers at an aerospace company and it\r\n    was found that smoking was a clear risk factor in noise-induced\r\n    hearing loss: the OR was 1.27 for \"ever smokers\" and 1.39 for present\r\n    smokers, compared with non-smokers (Barone et al., 1987). Vascular\r\n    insufficiency of the cochlear organ has been cited as the predominant\r\n    cause of progressive hearing loss that occurs with age. It was\r\n    suggested that smoking reduces the cochlear blood supply by:\r\n    a) vasospasm induced by nicotine; b) atherosclerotic narrowing of\r\n    vessels; and c) thrombotic occlusions (Zelman, 1973). In a study of\r\n    1000 subjects at a Veterans Hospital, Zelman (1973) found that whilst\r\n    age and sex were the most important variables, at all measured\r\n    frequencies the percentage of loss was greater for smokers, the\r\n    differences being greater at higher frequencies. From a retrospective\r\n    analysis of audiograms taken between 1984 and 1990 of a cohort of 119\r\n    workers, 78.8% of smokers compared with 25.7% of non-smokers had\r\n    noise-induced hearing loss (ILO, 1991). Although these studies\r\n    demonstrated a positive correlation between smoking and hearing loss,\r\n    Friedman et al. (1969) and Pyykko et al. (1987) were not able to show\r\n    that smoking was a significant risk factor to hearing loss. 3.6.4  Dupuytren's contracture\r\n\r\n    Dupuytren's contracture is a contracture of some muscle membranes of\r\n    the palm of the hand that causes the little finger and ring finger to\r\n    be drawn into the palm from where they cannot be extended. It is\r\n    characterized by a retractile sclerosis of the palmar aponeurosis,\r\n    which may progress to an irreducible flexion of the fingers. Opinions\r\n    differ on the influence of occupation, handedness and hand injury on\r\n    Dupuytrens contracture which Dupuytren himself attributed to chronic\r\n    occupational injury. Some people assert that heavy work always causes\r\n    the disease, while others claim that it is not responsible. Mikkelsen\r\n\r\n    (1978) studied 901 cases in an epidemiological study of 15 950 and\r\n    concluded, after isolating hand trauma, that Dupuytren's contracture\r\n    is caused by heavy work. The contribution made by tobacco has been as\r\n    contentious as has the cause of Dupuytren's contracture. Hand\r\n    thermography of affected fingers in Dupuytren's contracture shows a\r\n    drop in temperature of up to 3 degrees; and hand temperature falls by\r\n    a similar amount during smoking. In a study of 84 men and 16 women\r\n    with Dupuytren's contracture, Fraser-Moodie (1976) found no evidence\r\n    that smoking was connected with the condition, a conclusion also\r\n    reached by Mackenney (1983). However, cigarette smoking was listed\r\n    among the responsible factors for Dupuytren's contracture by Attali et\r\n    al. (1987), as well as by An et al. (1988), who found that cigarette\r\n    smoking was linked statistically to Dupuytren's contracture and\r\n    suggested that it may be involved in its pathogenesis by producing\r\n    microvascular occlusion and subsequent fibrosis and contracture. An et\r\n    al. (1988) concluded that cigarette smoking was one of the most\r\n    significant factors in the development of peripheral vasculopathy\r\n    Abelin et al. (1990) showed a significant association between\r\n    Dupuytren's contracture and smoking habits. 3.7  Biological agents 3.7.1  Biological (vegetable) dusts\r\n\r\n    Uncontrolled exposure to airborne vegetable dusts can affect health\r\n    and occurs worldwide in many workplaces, e.g., in agricultural\r\n    operations, textile industries, construction, carpentry and the\r\n    furniture industry. The population exposed is large, particularly in\r\n    developing countries where whole families, from young children to the\r\n    elderly, may engage in agricultural activities and small scale\r\n    manufacturing operations using vegetable products. These agents can\r\n    take the form of vegetable dusts, airborne fungal spores and\r\n    microorganisms, animal danders and feathers, herbicides and pesticides\r\n    and their residues. Processing of agricultural products, such as\r\n    cotton, flax, hemp, grain, tobacco, paprika and tea, and the milling\r\n    of certain varieties of wood are occupations where vegetable dust\r\n    exposures have been associated with detrimental health effects.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the irritation and bronchitis that is associated with\r\n    exposure to almost any dust, biological dusts can cause byssinosis,\r\n    allergic and immunological responses and, in some cases, nasal and\r\n    paranasal cancer. All these conditions can be affected in different\r\n    measure by tobacco smoking.\r\n\r\n    3.7.1.1  Cotton dust\r\n\r\n    Byssinosis is a respiratory disease of textile workers. The disease is\r\n    found in many cotton processing countries. It is more prevalent in the\r\n    dusty stages of cotton processing, such as carding, than in weaving.\r\n    Byssinosis, or similar symptoms, and bronchitis have also been found\r\n    in flax, hemp, jute and sisal workers. The characteristic symptoms are\r\n\r\n    tightness of the chest and shortness of breath on returning to work\r\n    after a period of absence. There is the possibility of progression to\r\n    permanent respiratory disability.\r\n\r\n    In a study of textile workers in South Carolina, USA, in 1973, the\r\n    smoking prevalence was almost the same for workers as for controls\r\n    (Beck et al., 1984). In another study of cotton workers in 1963-1966\r\n    (Molyneux & Tombleson, 1970), the percentage of male current smokers\r\n    was 62.5% and of ex-smokers 16.4%; among females the figures were\r\n    33.9% and 6.1%, respectively. Among flax scutchers in Normandy in\r\n    1986-1987, 56% were smokers and 18% were ex-smokers; compared with 45%\r\n    and 15%, respectively, for the controls (Cinkotai et al., 1988a). In\r\n    31 Lancashire textile factories (1988) 47.5% of the 4656 workers\r\n    interviewed were smokers (Cinkotai et al., 1988b). Of 800 000 American\r\n    workers surveyed (Stellman et al., 1988) for smoking habits in 1982,\r\n    5.9% were exposed to textile fibres or dust: 28.5% of these were\r\n    regular cigarette smokers and 44.9% were former cigarette smokers;\r\n    compared with 23.5% and 43.5%, respectively, in other occupations not\r\n    exposed to textiles.\r\n\r\n    Increases in both byssinosis and bronchitis were attributed to cotton\r\n    dust exposure and smoking in the cotton industry (Molyneux &\r\n    Tombleson, 1970; Merchant et al., 1973). From an industrial study of\r\n    the effects of cotton dust and cigarette smoke, Merchant et al. (1972)\r\n    concluded that smokers showed an increase in both the prevalence and\r\n    severity of cotton dust-induced byssinosis and that cigarette smoke\r\n    also increased the detrimental effect of cotton dust on ventilatory\r\n    capacity. It was suggested that the impairment of lung clearance\r\n    mechanisms by cigarette smoke could be responsible for the deleterious\r\n    effect of cotton dust and that smoking might lower the threshold of\r\n    susceptibility to the effects of inhaled cotton dust. Additivity and\r\n    the equal importance of the effects of smoke and cotton dust have been\r\n    suggested (Beck et al., 1984) but since different lung function\r\n    parameters are affected it would seem that the two factors affect\r\n    different sites. The fact that workers who stopped smoking, whilst\r\n    remaining in the same job, lost their byssinotic symptoms was\r\n    significant. A survey by Cinkotai et al. (1988a) of workers in 31\r\n    textile factories in Lancashire, United Kingdom, showed that\r\n    byssinotic symptoms (in decreasing order) were related to years in the\r\n    industry, degree of dust exposure, quality of cotton in use, ethnic\r\n    origin of workers and smoking habits. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis\r\n    were related primarily to smoking habits and then to factors connected\r\n    with the occupation. In a study of hemp workers (Bouhuys & Zuskin,\r\n    1976), decline in ventilatory function was more pronounced in smokers.\r\n    It was suggested (Cinkotai et al., 1988b) that a surprisingly low\r\n    prevalence of byssinotic symptoms in 12 flax scutching mills in\r\n    Normandy may have been due to either self selection of the workforce\r\n    or to an absence of the causative agent in the dust. Persistent cough\r\n    and phlegm production were associated with tobacco use.\r\n\r\n    In textile-related pulmonary disease, smoking as a primary causative\r\n    factor was reported by Pratt et al. (1980), and a similar conclusion\r\n    was arrived at from lung function tests carried out over a 3-year\r\n\r\n    period on 153 women (103 smokers, 50 non-smokers) with grades 2 and 3\r\n    byssinosis by Honeybourne & Pickering (1986). Cancer deaths in general\r\n    and lung cancer in particular were lower in workers exposed to cotton\r\n    dust than in others (Enterline et al., 1985). Kilburn (1989) suggested\r\n    that the effect of byssinosis on mortality of textile workers from\r\n    pulmonary disease needed more comprehensive study.\r\n\r\n    3.7.1.2  Wood dust\r\n\r\n    IARC (1995) evaluated the carcinogenic risk of wood dust and\r\n    classified it as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient\r\n    evidence in humans and inadequate evidence in animals. The risk of\r\n    developing cancer of the nasal cavity among workers manufacturing\r\n    wooden furniture has been shown to be up to 100 times greater than for\r\n    the general population (Rang & Acheson, 1981). The effect is worst in\r\n    the most dusty areas (Rang & Acheson, 1981; Hayes et al., 1986). The\r\n    association of risk with certain hardwoods and the finishing of fine\r\n    furniture, rather than with woodworking in general, suggests that it\r\n    may be allied to both the chemical and physical nature of the dust. In\r\n    the study where the nasal cancer incidence was 100 times greater than\r\n    for the general population, it did not appear to be affected by\r\n    smoking habits. A similar conclusion was reached in a study in an area\r\n    of Italy with a large number of cases of nasal cancer among wood and\r\n    leather workers (Cecchi et al., 1980). An association with smoking was\r\n    established in other studies, and current and past smoking habits were\r\n    shown to be a risk factor for developing squamous cell cancer of the\r\n    sinus in men (Fukuda et al., 1987). A case-control study of 121 male\r\n    woodworkers who were examined for cancer of the nasal cavity or\r\n    paranasal sinus, in British Columbia in Canada between 1939 and 1977\r\n    (Elwood, 1981), showed increased relative risks associated with\r\n    occupations involving exposure to wood (relative risk 2.5) and with\r\n    smoking (relative risk 4.9). In a study in North Carolina and Virginia\r\n    in the USA between 1970 and 1980 (Brinton et al., 1984), a major\r\n    finding was the elevated risk of nasal cavity and sinus cancer among\r\n    cigarette smokers. However, the nature of any interaction of wood dust\r\n    and tobacco smoking needs further study because adenocarcinomata\r\n    appear to be the tumour type associated with wood dust, whereas the\r\n    relative risks for squamous-cell and small-cell cancers tend to be\r\n    higher for smokers. The available data do not permit an assessment of\r\n    the degree of interaction between smoking and wood dust exposure.\r\n\r\n    3.7.1.3  Allergic responses\r\n\r\n    This type of response can occur in the upper airways, where it is\r\n    manifest as hay fever, in response to certain types of pollen, or in\r\n    the bronchi as asthma, or it may appear in both. Some of the dusts\r\n    that cause allergic airways responses (occupational asthma) are grain\r\n    dusts from various cereals and their products, wood dusts particularly\r\n    from red cedar and iroko, and dusts from teas and tobacco. Among\r\n    asthmatics, environmental cigarette smoke makes the effect of the\r\n    asthma worse (Shim & Williams, 1986), and smoking effects appear to be\r\n    additive to that of asthma from other causes (Conolly et al., 1988).\r\n\r\n    Grain dust exposure and smoking have been found to cause increases in\r\n    the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and reductions in pulmonary\r\n    function of grain elevator workers. The effect of smoking was slightly\r\n    more pronounced; the combined effect of grain dust and smoking\r\n    appeared to be additive, except in the least exposed workers (5 years\r\n    or less) where a synergistic effect was observed in tests for\r\n    peripheral airways dysfunction (Cotton et al., 1983). Chan-Yeung et\r\n    al. (1985) stated that the effect of grain dust and smoking was\r\n    additive and not synergistic in causing a decrease in lung function.\r\n    In 303 workers in the animal feed industry exposed to dusts of grains\r\n    and cassava, 61 (20%) showed respiratory symptoms; in office staff in\r\n    the same plant the prevalence was similar. The plant workers had a\r\n    higher prevalence of smoking than office staff. Current smoking was\r\n    strongly associated with respiratory complaints in both groups (Post\r\n    et al., 1994).\r\n\r\n    Occupational asthma also occurs in flour, tea, coffee and rice\r\n    handlers. In Italian bakers and pastry makers De Zotti et al. (1994)\r\n    found that 54 (23%) of the 226 subjects were atopic. Forty (18%) were\r\n    skin-test-positive to storage mites, 27 (12%) to wheat flour and 17\r\n    (8%) to alpha-amylase. Skin sensitization to these occupational\r\n    allergens was significantly associated with atopy, smoking and\r\n    duration of exposure. In a study of 401 workers in bakeries or flour\r\n    mills, Cullinan et al. (1994a) found that work-related symptoms of\r\n    allergy were more common in smokers, with little difference between\r\n    atopic and non-atopic workers. However, smoking was not independently\r\n    related to either symptoms or positive skin test.\r\n\r\n    Zetterstrom et al. (1981) skin-prick-tested 129 workers in a coffee\r\n    roastery with green coffee bean and castor bean extracts. There was a\r\n    significantly increased prevalence of positive skin prick tests in\r\n    smokers. In enzyme detergent workers with occupational asthma, it was\r\n    found that twice as many smokers as non-smokers exhibited asthmatic\r\n    symptoms (Greenberg et al., 1970; Mitchell & Gandevia, 1971).\r\n\r\n    Smokers are more likely to show higher specific antibody production\r\n    and correspondingly be more susceptible to asthma. 3.7.2  Other biological agents\r\n\r\n    Although many biological dusts are known to have detrimental health\r\n    effects, there have been few studies of any interaction of smoking\r\n    with these agents. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may be caused by\r\n    spores from a number of fungi which are small enough to reach the\r\n    pulmonary compartment. There are several forms of allergic alveolitis,\r\n    of which farmer's lung, bagasse pneumonitis, and bird fancier's lung\r\n    are examples. These are caused by fungal spores in mouldy hay or\r\n    mouldy sugar cane or an agent in bird feathers, respectively, and are\r\n    immunologically mediated (Lancet, 1985). Extrinsic allergic alveolitis\r\n    is a rare example of a respiratory disease which is more prevalent in\r\n    non-smokers than in smokers. In one study, 14 of 18 patients (11 with\r\n\r\n    farmer's lung and 7 with bird fancier's lung) were non-smokers, twice\r\n    the proportion of non-smokers in patients with cryptogenic fibrosing\r\n    alveolitis or in the local population (Warren, 1977). Carrillo et al.\r\n    (1991) investigated IgG response to pigeon serum and its relation to\r\n    tobacco smoking in 160 pigeon fanciers. The sensitization rate was\r\n    31.9%. Pigeon fanciers who were current smokers had significantly\r\n    lower levels of IgG antibodies to pigeon serum (P&lt0.001).\r\n    Precipitating antibodies to Micropolyspora faeni, a common cause of\r\n    farmer's lung, were found to be twice as common in the area of\r\n    non-smokers in farming communities compared with smokers (Morgan et\r\n    al., 1975). Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis has been shown to be\r\n    depressed by cigarette smoke and it has been suggested this may\r\n    explain its apparent protective effect (Hocking & Golde, 1979). 3.7.3  Agents found in factory farming (animal\r\n           confinement effects)\r\n\r\n    Factory farming of pigs, where the animals are kept in confined\r\n    conditions, is common practice in livestock production in many\r\n    developed countries and it has been found to be accompanied by adverse\r\n    respiratory symptoms in workers. Donham et al. (1984) summarized the\r\n    effects as: acute toxicosis and inflammation of the respiratory tract\r\n    from inhaling hydrogen sulfide; acute asthma-like symptoms;\r\n    bronchitis; and delayed or hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like symptoms.\r\n    They found that smoking interacted additively with the bronchitis and\r\n    obstructive symptoms of the condition. In a study of workers in swine\r\n    confinement areas, Zuskin et al. (1992) reported similar effects. They\r\n    also found that smoking aggravated acute and chronic respiratory\r\n    symptoms and impairment of lung function. 3.7.4  Laboratory animals\r\n\r\n    Venables et al. (1988b) examined data from three cross-sectional\r\n    surveys of 296 laboratory workers around 30 years of age exposed to\r\n    small mammals. Two populations were of pharmaceutical research workers\r\n    (N = 133 and 140) and one of research workers in a tobacco company \r\n    (N = 23). One of the pharmaceutical research worker populations had a\r\n    laboratory animal allergy (LAA) prevalence rate of over 40% (Venables\r\n    et al., 1988a). The tobacco company research workers were exposed only\r\n    to rats while the other two populations were exposed to rats, mice,\r\n    guinea-pigs and rabbits. Atopy was determined by skin prick test to\r\n    non-animal aeroallergens. Sensitization to laboratory animals was\r\n    determined by response to skin prick tests using urinary extracts from\r\n    the species used in each laboratory. Radioallergoabsorbent tests\r\n    (RASTs) were used to measure serum IgE antibody concentration to the\r\n    urinary extracts in two of the populations.\r\n\r\n    Atopy in the three populations ranged from 30% to 44%, and positive\r\n    skin response to urinary extract ranged from 13% to 48%. Pooled data\r\n    from the three surveys showed an association between smoking and\r\n\r\n    positive skin response to urinary extract. Associations with smoking\r\n    persisted after stratifying by atopic status, suggesting that smoking\r\n    was a risk factor for developing laboratory animal allergy.\r\n\r\n    In other studies of 238 laboratory workers without previous\r\n    occupational exposure to rats in three institutions specializing in\r\n    small animal research, atopy was again determined by skin prick test\r\n    response to non-animal aeroallergens and sensitization to laboratory\r\n    rats by response to urinary extract. Exposure to total dust and rat\r\n    urinary aeroallergen was also measured. Allergy to rats was positively\r\n    related to exposure intensity and this was stronger in atopic\r\n    subjects. Positive responses to skin prick testing with rat urinary\r\n    extract were strongly related to atopy and to smoking at all levels of\r\n    exposure (Cullinan et al., 1994b).\r\n\r\n    Several studies from Europe have shown an association between\r\n    ownership of pet birds or pigeons and lung cancer (Holst et al., 1988;\r\n    Kohlmeier et al., 1992; Gardiner et al., 1992). The relative risk\r\n    adjusted for smoking was 6.7 (2.2-20.0). However, two community-based\r\n    case-control studies, one from the USA and one from Sweden, could not\r\n    confirm an association between pet birds and lung cancer (Alavanja et\r\n    al., 1996; Modigh et al., 1996). In 1998, a hospital-based\r\n    case-control study conducted in New York City and Washington, DC, with\r\n    887 cases and 1350 controls, did not show an association of keeping\r\n    pet birds with lung cancer in non-smokers. There was a ten-fold\r\n    increase of lung cancer among smokers who were not bird keepers over\r\n    non-smokers, but there was no indication of synergism between smoking\r\n    and keeping a pet bird (Morabia et al., 1998). 3.7.5  Schistosomiasis\r\n\r\n    In a study carried out in Spain, risk factors for urinary bladder\r\n    cancer were identified (Bravo et al., 1987). The factors were listed\r\n    in order of importance and the first three were total number of\r\n    cigarettes smoked, history of urological disease and exposure to an\r\n    occupational risk. Vineis (1992) summarized epidemiological,\r\n    biochemical and molecular evidence that clearly linked smoking with an\r\n    increased risk of bladder cancer. Cohen & Johansson (1992) considered\r\n    smoking to be the most important etiological factor for bladder\r\n    cancer. They also implicated a variety of occupational exposures and,\r\n    in some parts of the world, an association with various endemic\r\n    diseases including schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a waterborne\r\n    parasitic disease found in many developing countries in Africa, Asia\r\n    and South America. It is a widespread occupational disease for\r\n    agricultural workers, and also affects members of the general\r\n    population.\r\n\r\n    A phase in the life-cycle of the trematodes responsible for the\r\n    disease lives in the blood vessels of visceral organs and their eggs\r\n    are discharged through the bladder or intestine in urine and faeces.\r\n    Some species live in the mesenteric veins and the eggs are discharged\r\n    in the faeces but the eggs of Schistosoma haematobium mature in the\r\n\r\n    veins of the bladder and are discharged in the urine. The eggs mature\r\n    in water and the resultant larvae infect freshwater snails. Within the\r\n    snail the parasites multiply to produce free swimming cercaria larvae\r\n    which can infect humans via skin penetration and repeat the cycle. S. haematobium is found in nearly all countries in the African continent\r\n    and it has been found that the incidence of bladder cancer is higher\r\n    in areas with a high prevalence of infection than in areas with a low\r\n    prevalence. IARC classifies infection with S. haematobium as\r\n    carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) (IARC, 1994b). In Egypt, the most\r\n    common form of cancer is bladder cancer, accounting for 27.6% of all\r\n    malignancies encountered (38.5% of cancers in males and 11.3% in\r\n    females), and these high levels have been attributed to underlying\r\n    schistosomiasis (Tawfik, 1987). Makhyoun (1974) carried out a\r\n    case-control study of smoking among Egyptian males with and without a\r\n    previous history of S. haematobium infection. A smoking index was\r\n    calculated (average number of cigarettes per day \u00d7 duration of smoking\r\n    in years) to categorize subjects. The smoking index (intensity and\r\n    duration of smoking) was higher in all the patients with bladder\r\n    cancer. In the patients with a previous schistosomiasis infection,\r\n    22.7% were moderate or heavy smokers compared with 79.3% of the\r\n    non-schistosomiasis patients. In the latter there was a good\r\n    correlation with the smoking index but in the bladder cancer patients\r\n    with previous schistosomiasis there was no significant difference in\r\n    smoking index between patients and matched controls. It was not\r\n    possible to identify an interaction between smoking and\r\n    schistosomiasis in the production of bladder cancer.\r\n\r\n    However, in a review of the role of S. haematobium in human bladder\r\n    cancer, Badawi et al. (1995) referred to several major studies that\r\n    implicated this infection with the subsequent development of bladder\r\n    cancer. Badawi et al. (1995) listed examples of a co-carcinogenic\r\n    effect of parasitic infection in the presence of chemical carcinogens\r\n    and it has been suggested (Hicks et al., 1980; Hicks, 1982) that\r\n    schistosomiasis could supply the necessary proliferative stimulus to\r\n    accelerate cancer growth from latent tumour foci on exposure to\r\n    carcinogenic nitrosamines. Nitrosamines have been implicated as\r\n    carcinogens among tobacco chewers and oral snuff users (Hecht &\r\n    Hoffmann, 1988, 1991; Hoffmann et al., 1991a), nitrosamines have been\r\n    demonstrated in smoke (Tricker & Preussmann, 1992; Hoffmann et al.,\r\n    1991b) and nicotine-derived N-nitrosamines cause cancer (Hoffmann &\r\n    Hoffmann, 1991; (IARC, 1991). Some N-nitrosamines are excreted as\r\n    esters via the urinary tract, e.g., N-nitroso-di- n-butanol or NNK\r\n    as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol. They may hydrolyse\r\n    in the presence of infectious agents in the bladder, as is the case in\r\n    schistosomiasis, and thus appear in their precarcinogenic form,\r\n    thereby increasing the risk for cancer in the urinary tract.\r\n    Endogenous nitrosation, which is increased by tobacco smoking, chewing\r\n    and oral snuff use has been demonstrated by monitoring urinary N-nitrosamino acids (Tsuda & Kurashima, 1991). Badawi & Mostafa\r\n    (1993) and Badawi et al. (1995) suggested that the evidence for an\r\n    association between urinary schistosomiasis and bladder cancer\r\n\r\n    development is sufficient to justify the conclusion that S. haematobium infection is a factor in inducing preneoplastic changes\r\n    in the bladder. Infection can reduce detoxification mechanisms (and\r\n    thus prolong retention of carcinogens in the bladder), stimulate\r\n    nitrosamine synthesis, and alter the activity of\r\n    carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes.\r\n\r\n    The conclusion is that an interaction is likely between tobacco use\r\n    and schistosomiasis infection. 3.7.6  Other urinary tract infections\r\n\r\n    Kantor et al. (1984) found that the joint effect of urinary tract\r\n    infection and cigarette smoking on bladder cancer was slightly beyond\r\n    that expected under an additive model and suggested that patients with\r\n    cystitis may be especially prone to tobacco-derived carcinogens in the\r\n    urine. La Vecchia et al. (1991) studied cystitis, gonorrhoea and\r\n    condylomata acuminata and found an interaction between urinary tract\r\n    infection and tobacco that appeared to be multiplicative, with\r\n    relative risk 2.4 for \"ever smoking\", 3.2 for cystitis alone, and 10.3\r\n    for combined exposure. It was concluded that a relationship between\r\n    urinary tract infection (and possibly some genital infections) and\r\n    bladder cancer indicated a cancer promotion role of infection and a\r\n    multiplicative smoking interaction. There have been reports of\r\n    synergism between herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines in cell transformation (Park et al., 1991a); an\r\n    additive interaction between smoking and herpes simplex virus type 2\r\n    in the promotion of cervical abnormalities (Mayberry, 1985), and the\r\n    possibility of an interaction between cigarette smoking and herpes\r\n    virus infection leading to cancer of the uterine cervix (Winkelstein\r\n    et al., 1984). 3.7.7  Sarcoidosis\r\n\r\n    Bresnitz & Strom (1983) reviewed sarcoidosis and concluded that\r\n    tobacco smoking might have a protective effect for the pathogenesis of\r\n    sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a generalized granulomatous disease\r\n    involving the reticulo-endothelial system with lesions predominantly\r\n    in the lymphatic system. Harf et al. (1986) investigated the smoking\r\n    habits of 113 cases of histologically confirmed sarcoidosis in a\r\n    case-control study in Lyon, France. Smoking habits were defined in 101\r\n    cases and these were compared with a control group of healthy\r\n    volunteers. There was a highly statistically significant negative\r\n    association between sarcoidosis and smoking (OR = 3.8; 95% confidence\r\n    interval: 2.4, 6.5) in both cases. 3.8  Vector effects Toxic chemicals, as well as harmless materials that produce harmful\r\n    chemical agents when they are burnt or vaporized, can be inadvertently\r\n    transferred to cigarettes or other smoking materials and cause the\r\n    smoke to be more injurious when it is inhaled. 3.8.1  Polytetrafluoroethylene\r\n\r\n    Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon(R)) is used in coatings for cooking\r\n    utensils, for making chemical vessels, gaskets and bearings and in\r\n    sprays as a mould release agent. Polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinyl\r\n    fluoride are inert materials but their thermal decomposition products\r\n    can be very biologically reactive. Cigarettes can be easily\r\n    contaminated in the workplace and, when smoked, the polymer burns to\r\n    form fumes which cause \"polymer-fume fever\": severe gripping chest\r\n    pain giving rise to difficulty in breathing; trembling and shaking;\r\n    elevated temperature; and severe diaphoresis. The symptoms pass after\r\n    a day or two, but recur on again smoking a contaminated cigarette.\r\n    Before the cause was recognized a case was recorded of a person, who\r\n    used the polymer in a mould release spray, having some 40 attacks\r\n    (Kuntz & McCord, 1974). Another case was a person who referred to the\r\n    disease as \"mould machine pneumonia\" (Kuntz & McCord, 1974). Other\r\n    cases have been reported (Albrecht & Bryant, 1987) and better\r\n    occupational hygiene and a ban on smoking in the workplace resulted in\r\n    the disappearance of symptoms in those previously affected. 3.8.2  Mercury\r\n\r\n    Inorganic mercury occurs in many industries, as elemental mercury in\r\n    scientific and electrical instruments, as amalgams with many other\r\n    metals, in paints and pigments and in the chemical industry, as well\r\n    as in mining and extraction of the metal. Organic mercury compounds\r\n    are used as antiseptics, disinfectants, fungicides, bactericides and\r\n    herbicides. Contamination of smoking materials can lead to the\r\n    inhalation of mercury vapour. Mercury has been detected by neutron\r\n    activation analysis as a naturally occurring trace element in tobacco\r\n    (&lt1.0 ng/g) and in the smoke of cigarettes (4 ng/cigarette)\r\n    (Schneider & Krivan, 1993; Krivan et al., 1994). 3.9  Effects of tobacco smoking and metabolism of drugs and other\r\n         chemicals 3.9.1  Oral contraceptive use\r\n\r\n    In the 1970s it was postulated that an interaction between tobacco use\r\n    and oral contraceptives increased the risk of myocardial infarction in\r\n    women. In a study of women less than 45 years of age, a greater\r\n    proportion of moderate to heavy smokers were found in oral\r\n    contraceptive users experiencing myocardial infarction, compared\r\n    against a control population (Mann et al., 1975, 1976). Sturtevant\r\n    (1982), however, found no \"convincing evidence\" for an interaction or\r\n    synergism between the factors smoking and oral contraceptive use for\r\n    the major classes of cardiovascular disease. Lidegaard (1993) reported\r\n    no difference in the proportion of smokers between users and non-users\r\n    of oral contraceptives in Danish women experiencing a cerebral\r\n    thromboembolic attack and age-matched controls. Regarding thrombosis,\r\n    the data of Vessey & Doll (1969) suggest an increased thromboembolism\r\n\r\n    risk from oral contraceptive use for heavy smokers compared to\r\n    non-smokers. However, other studies reviewed by Sturtevant (1982) and\r\n    Nevius et al. (1982) are said to be ambiguous regarding a possible\r\n    interaction between smoking and oral contraceptive use. On balance,\r\n    there is evidence for certain interactions between smoking and oral\r\n    contraceptive use: the US Surgeon General (1983a), concluded that\r\n    \"women who use oral contraceptives and who smoke increase their risk\r\n    of a myocardial infarction by an approximately tenfold factor,\r\n    compared with women who neither use oral contraceptives nor smoke\",\r\n    and \"the use of both cigarettes and oral contraceptives greatly\r\n    increases the risk for subarachnoid haemorrhage among women.\" 3.9.2  Drug and chemical metabolism\r\n\r\n    A number of studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of various\r\n    drugs and other chemicals is influenced by the smoking status of the\r\n    individual. This effect is sufficiently noteworthy that the US Surgeon\r\n    General (1979) report concluded that it is \"apparent that cigarette\r\n    smoking is one of the primary causes of drug interactions in humans\".\r\n    The extensive review of the literature at that time led to the\r\n    conclusions that, with respect to the influence of smoking on the\r\n    disposition/metabolism of other compounds: (a) the dominant effect of\r\n    smoking is enhanced drug disposition caused by the induction of\r\n    hepatic enzymes; (b) tobacco smoke contains many enzyme inducers,\r\n    notably polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons; and (c) smoking can induce\r\n    the metabolism of various therapeutic agents and their pharmacological\r\n    and/or clinical effects. The metabolism of chemical carcinogens\r\n    involves various isozymes of cytochromes P450 and differences in their\r\n    genotypes or phenotypes may be a main factor responsible for\r\n    differences among individuals in susceptibility to carcinogens.\r\n    Metabolic activation of the procarcinogens such as benzo( a)pyrene to\r\n    the ultimate form is accomplished by cytochrome P450IA1 (Kawajiri et\r\n    al., 1990; Kawajiri & Fujii-Kuriyama, 1991; Nakachi et al., 1991).\r\n    Although the most noteworthy effects of smoking cited were related to\r\n    enzyme induction, it should also be noted that other components of the\r\n    smoke, such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, cadmium, some pesticides,\r\n    cyanide and acrolein, may serve to inhibit the function of some\r\n    enzymes (Jusko, 1978). An example for this phenomenon is the\r\n    inhibition by nicotine of the P450 isozymes that are involved in the\r\n    metabolic activation of NNN and NNK (Murphy & Heiblum, 1990). Nicotine\r\n    levels exceed those of NNN and NNK by more than 500 times. Therefore,\r\n    it was not surprising that even increasing NNN and NNK levels in snuff\r\n    ten-fold by adding the synthetic compounds did not alter the\r\n    carcinogenic potency of snuff in the oral cavity of rats (Hecht et\r\n    al., 1986).\r\n\r\n    Miller (1990) reviewed how cigarette smoking affects the\r\n    pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of various drugs. The\r\n    drugs pentazocine, phenylbutazone and heparin show increased\r\n    metabolism in smokers. Also in smokers, the metabolism of oestrogen\r\n    and theophylline is increased. In addition, although smoking does not\r\n    pharmacokinetically affect the drugs propranolol and pindolol, the\r\n\r\n    nicotine in smoke is associated with elevations in blood pressure, and\r\n    thus smoking might serve to inhibit the antihypertensive effects of\r\n    these beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. On the other hand, smoking\r\n    had no effect on the drug disposition and/or pharmacological effects\r\n    of various other drugs examined (Jusko, 1978; Miller, 1990). 3.10  Animal studies of the interactions between cigarette smoke\r\n          exposure and other agents Fourteen chronic inhalation studies (whole-body or nose-only exposure)\r\n    with mainstream cigarette smoke in rats and mice were reviewed by\r\n    Coggins (1998) and the results and histopathological changes\r\n    contrasted with epidemiological studies in humans. In most of the\r\n    studies there were epithelial changes in conducting airways and\r\n    increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, occasionally associated\r\n    with alveolar metaplasia. Lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas were seen\r\n    in some of the studies but no statistically significant increase in\r\n    the incidence of malignant lung tumours was found in either rats or\r\n    mice. This contrasts with human epidemiology where there is an\r\n    increased lung cancer risk. In an invited commentary, Morgan (1998)\r\n    stated that, based on these differences, rodents may be ineffective\r\n    models for predicting human health risk, at least for certain inhaled\r\n    materials, but stressed the interspecies differences in respiratory\r\n    anatomy and physiology and the need for consideration of the many\r\n    factors that may lead to differences in the effects of tobacco smoke\r\n    exposure.\r\n\r\n    The existing animal toxicology studies regarding interactions between\r\n    tobacco smoke and other materials do not form a comprehensive body of\r\n    work on the topic. A number of combinations of exposures between smoke\r\n    and other agents have been studied. Results are at times inconsistent\r\n    or contradictory, and the mechanisms by which interactions occur are\r\n    often not understood. This section provides a brief review of the\r\n    literature. In general, the existing work: (a) was generally performed\r\n    using rodents; (b) usually (but not always) examined the effects of\r\n    cigarette smoking (or components of the smoke) combined with either\r\n    with specific chemical components of the smoke or with radiation; and\r\n    (c) usually examined cancer as the biological response end-point of\r\n    interest. Other studies have focused on the use of cigarette smoke\r\n    components or condensates, and have used models such as in vitro cell systems or mouse skin; a discussion of these studies is beyond\r\n    the scope of this section. 3.10.1  Non-cancer end-points\r\n\r\n    Several studies in experimental animals have examined the effects of\r\n    cigarette smoke administered over short periods of time (from hours to\r\n    daily exposures over several weeks). The cigarette smoke-induced\r\n    increase in the number of pulmonary macrophages and leukocytes noted\r\n    in humans has also been seen in animals such as the guinea-pig, even\r\n    after short exposures (Rylander et al., 1979). In addition, Morimoto\r\n    et al. (1993) observed a synergistic increase between mineral fibres\r\n\r\n    and exposure to cigarette smoke in the production of tumour necrosis\r\n    factor by rat alveolar macrophages. On the other hand, a 10-week\r\n    tobacco smoke exposure in rats suppressed radiation- induced pulmonary\r\n    inflammation (Nilsson et al., 1992), and a 12-week exposure of rats to\r\n    smoke did not influence the lung damage caused by an intratracheal\r\n    instillation of cadmium (Lai & Diamond, 1992).\r\n\r\n    Nishikawa et al. (1992) studied in guinea-pigs the effects of combined\r\n    exposure and single exposure to ozone and cigarette smoke on airway\r\n    responsiveness and tracheal vascular permeability and found that the\r\n    combined exposure increased airway responsiveness and vascular\r\n    permeability to a greater extent in terms of magnitude, but not in\r\n    duration, than a single exposure. This indicated that combined\r\n    exposure was more harmful than exposure to either agent alone. 3.10.2  Cancer studies: tobacco (cigarette) smoke plus other chemicals\r\n\r\n    Mori (1964) studied rats receiving multiple subcutaneous injections of\r\n    the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO) with or without 6-7\r\n    month inhalation of cigarette smoke. Six of eight rats had lung\r\n    carcinomas in the combined exposure group compared to 3 of 9 rats in\r\n    the NQO-only group, and tumours occurred earlier. Davis et al. (1975)\r\n    studied Wistar rats receiving single intratracheal instillations of\r\n    benzo( a)pyrene with or without cigarette smoke inhalation for most\r\n    of the lifespan. Slight elevations of pulmonary squamous neoplasia\r\n    were noted in the combined exposure group compared with the individual\r\n    agents alone. However, the effects were not statistically significant.\r\n\r\n    In mice, inhaled cigarette smoke did not influence the occurrence of\r\n    lung tumours in (a) B6C3F1 mice pretreated with 3-methylcholanthrene\r\n    or benzo( a)pyrene (Henry & Kouri, 1984), (b) C57BL mice receiving\r\n    benzo( a)pyrene or influenza virus(Harris & Negroni, 1967), (c) A/J\r\n    mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of the tobacco specific\r\n    nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and a\r\n    6-month inhalation of smoke using a whole-body mode of exposure (Finch\r\n    et al., 1996), or (d) A/J mice exposed to sidestream smoke plus the\r\n    carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene or urethane (Witschi et al., 1997). On\r\n    the other hand, a carcinogenic synergism in lung adenoma formation was\r\n    reported in Strain A mice some 6 months after initiation of treatment\r\n    with intraperitoneally injected urethane and skin-painted cigarette\r\n    smoke tar (DiPaolo & Sheehe, 1962). However, the non- pulmonary route\r\n    of exposure makes it difficult to interpret the relevance of this\r\n    result.\r\n\r\n    Several studies in hamsters have combined cigarette smoke exposure\r\n    with other agents. Dontenwill et al. (1973) combined smoke exposure\r\n    with a single intratracheal instillation of asbestos, but found no\r\n    significant differences in laryngeal lesions or tumours in the group\r\n    exposed to both materials, compared with the group receiving smoke\r\n    alone; the asbestos alone was non-tumorigenic. The combination of a\r\n    single intratracheal administration of dimethylbenz( a)anthrene\r\n    (DMBA) and smoke was found to increase the tumour incidence in the\r\n\r\n    oral cavity, pharynx, trachea and non-pulmonary tissues, compared to\r\n    the individual agents alone (Dontenwill et al., 1973). A similar\r\n    synergism between DMBA and smoke in producing laryngeal papillomas and\r\n    other oral and laryngeal lesions was reported by Hoffmann et al.\r\n    (1979) and by Kobayashi et al. (1974), and a synergism was also noted\r\n    between the nitrosamine DENA and smoke (Dontenwill et al., 1973).\r\n    Hamsters pretreated with a single dose of either 1.0, 3.3 or 10.0 mg\r\n    of NNK, and subsequently exposed twice daily for up to 72 weeks to\r\n    diluted cigarette smoke developed significantly more tumours in the\r\n    respiratory tract than hamsters receiving the identical dosage of NNK\r\n    and subjected to sham-smoking (Hecht et al., 1983). This supports the\r\n    concept that tobacco smoke has tumour-promoting activity. A\r\n    combination of smoke plus benzo( a)-pyrene adsorbed onto haematite\r\n    produced tracheal and laryngeal hyperplasia, whereas either agent\r\n    alone did not (Hoffmann et al., 1979), but no tumours were produced. 3.10.3  Cancer studies: cigarette smoke plus radiation\r\n\r\n    Dogs were used to study the potential interactions between radon and\r\n    cigarette smoke inhalation in producing lung cancer (Cross et al.,\r\n    1982). The lung tumour incidence in dogs exposed to radon plus\r\n    cigarette smoke for 4-5 years was decreased compared to that of dogs\r\n    receiving a mixture of radon, radon daughters, and uranium ore dust.\r\n\r\n    Studies have examined the potential interactions between tobacco smoke\r\n    and the alpha-emitters radon or plutonium-239 in rats or mice. In a\r\n    series of studies, Chameaud et al. (1982) examined the effects of\r\n    combined exposures to radon and cigarette smoke in Sprague-Dawley\r\n    rats, as well as the effects of pre-treatment with either radon or\r\n    smoke exposure. Smoke exposures begun before radon exposure did not\r\n    influence the radon-induced lung tumour incidence, but this increased\r\n    by 2- to 3-fold in the combined exposure group receiving radon before\r\n    cigarette smoke compared to the group receiving radon alone.\r\n\r\n    Finch et al. (1995a) examined F-344 rats receiving a single inhalation\r\n    exposure to 239PuO2, combined with chronic (up to 30 months)\r\n    cigarette smoke exposure, and found a synergistic crude tumour\r\n    incidence in rats receiving both agents, compared with animals\r\n    receiving the radiation alone. Most of these effects could be\r\n    explained by a cigarette-smoke-induced retardation of lung clearance\r\n    of the 239PuO2 particles (Finch et al., 1995b). This group is\r\n    continuing to study the potential combined effects of smoke and X-ray\r\n    exposure in rats, and the potential effects of smoke combined with\r\n    either X- or alpha-irradiation in mice (Finch et al., 1995a). Talbot\r\n    et al. (1987) reported results of a study in which mice inhaled\r\n    cigarette smoke, 239PuO2 or both materials. As in the case of rats,\r\n    cigarette smoke exposure caused retarded lung clearance and thus led\r\n    to greater radiation doses in animals receiving both agents. 4.  EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE AND OTHER AGENTS: SEPARATE\r\n        EFFECTS OR POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS 4.1  Coal mining 4.1.1  Coal dust\r\n\r\n    Coal miners can suffer from chronic bronchitis, coal workers\r\n    pneumoconiosis, progressive massive fibrosis, and emphysema. The\r\n    respiratory impairment appears as radiologically visible and\r\n    functional changes in the lungs, but although some of these are\r\n    associated solely with coal dust, some are also closely associated\r\n    with smoking. In the past it has been difficult to apportion\r\n    attributable risk to the two causes due to the fact that coalface\r\n    workers, the group subjected to the highest dust exposure, have a\r\n    different smoking pattern and perhaps a different daily consumption of\r\n    smoking materials than non-coalface workers because smoking in the\r\n    mine is forbidden. With the limitation of dust in modern mining, the\r\n    effect of the two factors, dust and smoking, is becoming clearer.\r\n    However, difficulties arise in interpreting data because non-smokers\r\n    may accumulate more dust, as they have less absenteeism, a different\r\n    pattern of lung clearance and a longer life (NIOSH, 1995).\r\n\r\n    In most of the countries surveyed, the prevalence of smoking by miners\r\n    tends to have been somewhat higher than in either the male population\r\n    as a whole, or among most other occupational groups, although a\r\n    distinction is seldom drawn between miners and coal miners except in\r\n    studies centred on coal mining populations. Between 1963 and 1975 in\r\n    the United Kingdom, the smoking prevalence fell for the male\r\n    population (and for miners) from 54% (miners 77%) to 47% (miners 49%)\r\n    (Lee, 1976). The figures for 1988 and 1990 were 33% and 31% (Bennett\r\n    et al., 1996) and for face-trained coalminers 35.7% in 1989 (Elliott,\r\n    1995). In a study of 8555 American miners from 29 bituminous coal\r\n    mines (Kibelstis et al., 1973), over 50% were smokers and 25% were\r\n    ex-smokers. In a United Kingdom study (Love & Miller, 1982), only 13%\r\n    of 1677 coal miners from 5 British collieries, who were examined in a\r\n    lung function study, were non-smokers; 66% were regular smokers and\r\n    the remainder were intermittent or ex-smokers. In a 20 year follow-up\r\n    study of a population of coal British miners and others (Cochrane &\r\n    Moore, 1980), 69% of the coal miners were smokers. These examples\r\n    typify the smoking prevalence of coal miners prior to the early\r\n    1980's. A 1982 survey of 800 000 American men and women in relation to\r\n    their occupations (Stellman et al., 1988) found that among miners\r\n    (type unspecified) 29.4% had never smoked regularly, 31.5% were\r\n    current smokers and 39.1% were former cigarette smokers. This may\r\n    reflect a general trend in the countries with higher income economies\r\n    where smoking has been decreasing in many sections of the population. 4.1.2  Bronchitis in coal miners\r\n\r\n    Kibelstis et al. (1973) found that the prevalence of bronchitis in\r\n    coal miners who smoked was higher than in non-smoking coal miners.\r\n    Coalface workers had more bronchitis and more airway obstruction than\r\n\r\n    surface workers and the difference between smokers working at the\r\n    coalface and non-smoking surface workers showed that the effect of\r\n    smoking was five times greater than that of coal dust. A German\r\n    epidemiological evaluation of chronic obstructive bronchitis in 5605\r\n    miners, 1276 ex-miners and 3898 individuals who had never worked in a\r\n    mine showed that smoking has a more serious effect on miners than on\r\n    other groups (Roth et al., 1985). It is possible that, within a mining\r\n    community, the other two groups may have a predisposition to the\r\n    disease and have achieved their status by job selection or job escape.\r\n    In a study of new entrants into coal mining McLintock (1971) found\r\n    that those who drop out of mining tend to be less physically fit and\r\n    more prone to chest problems than those who remain.\r\n\r\n    Morgan (1982) analysed the effects of cigarette smoking, dust exposure\r\n    and environmental factors on respiratory disease, and concluded that\r\n    bronchitis and airways obstruction were two separate responses to\r\n    cigarette smoking. The airflow obstruction found in smokers is due to\r\n    small airways disease and an involvement of respiratory bronchioles\r\n    leading to the development of emphysema. In coal miners, the\r\n    prevalence of bronchitis among non-smokers is related to the degree of\r\n    dust exposure. Marine et al. (1988) analysed data from studies on 53\r\n    382 coal miners in the United Kingdom and found that smoking miners\r\n    were at greater risk of developing chronic bronchitis. In a study by\r\n    Selig & Nestler (1985) of the relationship between chronic bronchitis,\r\n    smoking and dust (unspecified source), heavy smoking was equated with\r\n    20 years of dust exposure. From postmortem examinations of coal mine\r\n    workers, a correlation was reported between clinical chronic\r\n    bronchitis and smoking (Selig & Nestler, 1985).\r\n\r\n    The chronic bronchitis of coal miners is probably a combination of (a)\r\n    mucus hypersecretion caused by dust; (b) mucus hypersecretion, mucus\r\n    modification and clearance impairment caused by tobacco smoke; (c)\r\n    small airways disease caused by tobacco smoke; and (d) the effect of\r\n    dust on small airways tissue already inflamed by smoking. Bronchitis\r\n    due to smoking causes mucus hypersecretion which is much greater than\r\n    that due to coal dust (Morgan, 1982). Cigarette smoke impairs lung\r\n    clearance by changing the physical and chemical properties of mucus\r\n    and causing ciliastasis. Rheological measurement show changes in the\r\n    viscoelastic properties of mucus; chemically the mucus glycoprotein\r\n    structure is changed (King et al., 1989) and the irritant gases in\r\n    smoke cause abnormal mucus secretion and ciliastasis (Holbrook, 1977).\r\n    Small airways disease and bronchiolitis, leading to emphysema, are due\r\n    to smoking rather than to dust (Morgan, 1982). 4.1.3  Emphysema and pneumoconiosis in coal miners\r\n\r\n    Dust in coal mining is considered to be the primary cause of coal\r\n    workers pneumoconiosis. In a study of coalworkers and non-coalworkers,\r\n    Cockroft et al. (1982) concluded, after taking any effect of smoking\r\n    into account, that there was a 7-fold excess of emphysema in\r\n    coalworkers. Results of postmortem examinations of 866 Australian\r\n    miners (Leigh et al., 1983) showed a positive correlation between dust\r\n\r\n    exposure and emphysema and pneumoconiosis, with the severity highest\r\n    in non-smokers. However, smoking and non-smoking coalface workers were\r\n    not compared. From a postmortem comparison of lungs from 450 coal\r\n    miners, Rockley et al. (1984) found that emphysema occurred more\r\n    frequently in smokers (72%) than in ex-smokers (65%) or in non-smokers\r\n    (42%) and the relative frequency increased with age at death. The\r\n    study considered the possibility that coal dust might cause emphysema\r\n    which inhibits clearance and, in turn, promotes fibrosis, or\r\n    alternatively that fibrosis caused by dust increases the chance of\r\n    emphysema. However, the findings of a study of South Wales coal miners\r\n    (Fletcher., 1972) militated against dust-induced emphysema. It has\r\n    been suggested that differences in emphysema between coalworkers and\r\n    non-coalworkers can be accounted for by taking into account current\r\n    smokers in the two groups. Morgan (1982) concluded that the evidence\r\n    militates against obstructive emphysema occurring more commonly in\r\n    coal miners than in the general population, or that more dust\r\n    inhalation leads to a greater likelihood of emphysema developing.\r\n    Reviews of small airways disease (SAD) suggested that emphysema\r\n    proceeds from smoking-induced SAD. Cosio et al. (1980) considered that\r\n    their observations supported the hypothesis that SAD is causally\r\n    related to centrilobular emphysema, but not necessarily to panlobular\r\n    emphysema. 4.1.4  Lung cancer in coal miners\r\n\r\n    Perhaps as a result of failure to control confounding factors, there\r\n    has been a lack of consistency among reports on the relationship\r\n    between coal mining and lung cancer incidence in miners. In a direct\r\n    evaluation of the relationship between lung cancer mortality and coal\r\n    mine dust exposure, controlling for smoking status, Ames et al. (1983)\r\n    found no evidence of a link between coal mine dust exposure and lung\r\n    cancer risk, nor of an interaction effect, although the expected lung\r\n    cancer risk in cigarette smokers was observed. From a study of dust\r\n    exposure, pneumoconiosis and mortality of coal miners (Miller &\r\n    Jacobsen, 1985) it was found that lung cancer mortality among miners\r\n    who smoked was 5.5 times higher than in \"never smokers\" but that the\r\n    effect was entirely due to smoking.\r\n\r\n    Radon and radon daughter contamination of the dust in coal mines might\r\n    be expected to be as prevalent as in all other mines, and thus the\r\n    apparent very low lung cancer risk in coal mining may seem unexpected.\r\n    However, because of the explosion risk in coal mines, the ventilation\r\n    is usually efficient and a build-up of radioactivity is probably less\r\n    likely than in other types of mine. 4.2  Other mineral dusts 4.2.1  Talc\r\n\r\n    Talc is a hydrated magnesium silicate, often contaminated with free\r\n    silica or fibrous asbestos-like minerals such as tremolite and\r\n    anthophyllite. The only significant difference in the effects on\r\n\r\n    exposed and non-exposed was in the number and severity of cases of\r\n    dyspnoea in the talc workers, and smoking was considered to be an\r\n    aggravating factor (Kleinfeld et al., 1973). 4.2.2  Kaolin\r\n\r\n    Kaolin (pure China clay) is a hydrated aluminium silicate used for\r\n    ceramics and as a filler in the paper, rubber and paint industries.\r\n    The dry powder can give rise to fibrotic nodules in the lungs (Seaton\r\n    et al., 1981; Wagner et al., 1986). Characteristic smoker's inclusions\r\n    have been seen in transmission electron micrographs of pulmonary\r\n    alveolar macrophages obtained from cigarette smokers. The contents of\r\n    these inclusions are heterogeneous and include electron-dense areas,\r\n    lipid material and needle-like structures. These have properties\r\n    consistent with the composition of kaolinite. Kaolinite is present in\r\n    cigarette smoke from different brands, and pulmonary alveolar\r\n    macrophages are able to ingest this material in vivo (Hocking &\r\n    Golde, 1979). 4.2.3  Alumina\r\n\r\n    Alumina (aluminium oxide) is extremely hard and is used as an abrasive\r\n    (corundum). A cross-sectional study of 788 employees of an aluminium\r\n    production company examined the relationship of radiographic\r\n    abnormalities to smoking and dust exposure during bauxite and alumina\r\n    mining and refining (Townsend et al., 1988). Chest radiographs showed\r\n    a moderate time trend of increasing prevalence of small opacities in\r\n    non-smokers with high cumulative dust exposures. In most exposure\r\n    categories, smokers had a higher prevalence of opacities than\r\n    non-smokers. For cumulative exposures of less than 100 mg/m3-years,\r\n    increasing trends with duration of exposure were accentuated in\r\n    smokers as compared to non-smokers. The stronger effects observed in\r\n    smokers were attributed to the joint effects of duration of smoking\r\n    and duration of occupational exposure (Townsend et al., 1988). 4.3  Fibrous minerals Fibrous minerals have been implicated in pleural thickening, pulmonary\r\n    fibrosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer in some villages in the\r\n    Anatolian region of Turkey (Artvinli & Baris, 1979), where fibrous\r\n    zeolite minerals (chabazite and erionite) are present in volcanic\r\n    deposits and used in buildings. Erionite has been shown to induce\r\n    mesothelioma. The symptoms and pathology of the respiratory disorders\r\n    and malignant disease were similar to those of asbestos. Asbestos-type\r\n    diseases have also been described in communities exposed to zeolite\r\n    minerals and tremolite dust in other similar regions by Baris et al.\r\n    (1979) and Yazicioglu et al. (1980). Non-asbestos fibrous materials\r\n    have been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (Stanton et al., 1977).\r\n    There are no data on any interaction of these minerals with smoking\r\n    but there appears to be a potential for interaction.\r\n\r\n    Wollastonite is a fibrous monocalcium silicate, which has been used as\r\n    a substitute for asbestos, as a filler and flux in ceramics, in\r\n    grinding wheels, refractory products, building blocks and acoustic\r\n    tiles. It is weakly fibrogenic. Hanke et al. (1984) studied a small\r\n    population of workers exposed to wollastonite and attributed\r\n    significant levels of chronic cough, phlegm and bronchitis to smoking\r\n    and not to exposure to wollastonite. 4.4  Metals 4.4.1  Antimony\r\n\r\n    Antimony is chemically similar to arsenic. Arsenic is metalloid,\r\n    antimony is a metal, both have volatile hydrides and form halogen,\r\n    oxygen and sulfur derivatives. Compounds of both frequently occur\r\n    together, particularly in smelter fume. Biological effects are similar\r\n    to those of arsenic (De Wolff & Edelbroek, 1994; De Wolff, 1995).\r\n\r\n    The concentrations of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt,\r\n    lanthanum, lead, selenium and zinc measured in lung tissues of\r\n    deceased smelter workers suggested that lung cancer risk was\r\n    multifactorial, involving carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic factors\r\n    (Gerhardsson & Nordberg, 1993). A 30-year study at an antimony smelter\r\n    did not specifically implicate antimony as the cause of excess lung\r\n    cancer because of concurrent exposure to other carcinogens (Jones,\r\n    1994). In another study of smelters, the data suggested an increase in\r\n    lung cancer and non-malignant respiratory and heart disease (Schnorr\r\n    et al., 1995).\r\n\r\n    Antimony can have harmful effects on lung tissues, including\r\n    pneumoconiosis. IARC (1989a) evaluated antimony trioxide and antimony\r\n    trisulfide and concluded that the trioxide was possibly carcinogenic\r\n    to humans (Group 2B) and the trisulfide was not classifiable (Group\r\n    3). It is likely that the effects of inhalation of antimony fume/dust\r\n    and tobacco smoke would be worse than inhaling either separately. The\r\n    similarities of antimony to arsenic, both chemically and in some\r\n    biological effects, leads to the conclusion that tobacco smoke and\r\n    antimony could interact like tobacco smoke and arsenic in producing\r\n    toxicity. 4.4.2  Cadmium\r\n\r\n    Most zinc and lead-zinc ores contain small amounts of cadmium. It is\r\n    used in electroplating, in metal alloys (with copper for overhead\r\n    wires, and aluminium for casting), in nickel-cadmium dry cells, for\r\n    pigment manufacture and use, added to silver to prevent staining, and\r\n    it is a hazard of welding. The main route of exposure for the\r\n    non-smoking general population is via food, while for exposed workers\r\n    it enters the body mainly by inhalation. Tobacco is an important\r\n    source of cadmium in smokers (IPCS, 1992), and the tobacco source\r\n    affects the level of cadmium exposure (Yue, 1992). Any intake is\r\n    important because cadmium has an extremely long biological half-life.\r\n\r\n    It was suggested (Hassler et al., 1983) that higher levels of cadmium\r\n    in the blood and urine of exposed workers could arise both from\r\n    workplace contamination of cigarettes and transfer as fume during\r\n    smoking.\r\n\r\n    Cadmium has various toxic effects, the earliest being impairment of\r\n    renal tubular function leading to failure of resorption and excretion\r\n    of low molecular weight protein, glycosuria, aminoaciduria and\r\n    hypercalciuria (IPCS, 1992; IARC, 1993). It has been associated with\r\n    some types of lung disorder (emphysema, obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n    and diffuse fibrosis) (IPCS, 1992) Exposure to cadmium compounds has\r\n    been associated with cancer of the lung. There is some evidence for an\r\n    association with prostatic cancer (IARC, 1993). Other epidemiological\r\n    studies did not confirm an increased risk of prostatic cancer\r\n    (Kazantzis et al., 1992). The evaluation by IARC (1993) concluded that\r\n    cadmium and cadmium compounds are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\r\n    The supposition that cadmium in cigarette tobacco or in the workplace\r\n    may cause lung cancer has been questioned (Lamm et al., 1992;\r\n    Hertz-Picciotto & Hu, 1994). In a cohort mortality study of cadmium\r\n    workers in England, an observed increase lung cancer risk could not be\r\n    attributed strictly to cadmium due to the presence of multiple\r\n    confounding factors, particularly arsenic (Kazantzis et al., 1992).\r\n    Lamm et al. (1992) also suggested that arsenic may be responsible for\r\n    the observed lung cancer increased. The many elements in the lung\r\n    tissues of deceased smelter workers (Gerhardsson & Nordberg, 1993)\r\n    illustrates the difficulty in apportioning a role to one material in a\r\n    multifactorial environment.\r\n\r\n    Cadmium affects the myocardium and produces hypertension in animal\r\n    studies but the induction of cardiovascular disease and hypertension\r\n    in humans has not been demonstrated in epidemiological studies\r\n    (Kristensen, 1989; IPCS, 1992)). Blood and urine cadmium levels are\r\n    higher in smokers than in non-smokers and were found to be\r\n    considerably elevated in smokers working in an alkaline battery\r\n    factory (Hassler et al., 1983) and in smelter workers who were also\r\n    smokers (Kazantzis & Armstrong, 1984; Lilis et al., 1984a,b).\r\n\r\n    Davison et al. (1988) reported a cadmium dose/effect relationship in\r\n    functional and radiological evidence of emphysema in 101 subjects.\r\n    Leduc et al. (1993) described the very rapid development of emphysema\r\n    in a smoker after exposure to very high levels of cadmium. Smoking by\r\n    cumulatively increasing the body burden and hindering the lung\r\n    clearance may have provided an additional cause for the emphysema.\r\n    However, an additive or synergistic mechanism for the cadmium plus\r\n    smoking effect could not be inferred in this case because of the high\r\n    cadmium dose. 4.4.3  Cobalt\r\n\r\n    Cobalt is used in the production of alloys, tungsten carbide tools,\r\n    permanent magnets, and in the electrical industry.\r\n\r\n    Cobalt has toxic effects (Beliles, 1994). Cobalt exposure has been\r\n    linked to various allergic reactions (Shirakawa et al., 1992); hard\r\n    metal exposure and smoking together arithmetically increased total IgE\r\n    levels. Interstitial lung disease has been associated with cobalt in\r\n    susceptible individuals (Sprince et al., 1988), although in a study\r\n    involving the manufacture of permanent magnets (Deng et al., 1991)\r\n    abnormalities in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms were no\r\n    higher than those of a reference population, except for 4 subjects out\r\n    of 362, who showed diffuse patches consistent with pneumoconiosis. 4.4.4  Lead\r\n\r\n    Lead is used in batteries, paint, glass, ceramics, fuel additives and\r\n    other industrial applications. In lead-using industries the main route\r\n    of exposure is by inhalation, mainly as dust and fume. Lead has a\r\n    range of toxic effects on blood, and the renal and nervous systems\r\n    (IPCS, 1995).\r\n\r\n    Levels of lead in blood vary from one area to another, between urban,\r\n    rural and occupationally exposed populations, and between men and\r\n    women (IPCS, 1995). The tobacco plant absorbs lead from the soil and\r\n    around 5-6% of that in cigarettes is inhaled in the smoke. Lead\r\n    concentrations in the smoke from one cigarette were found to range\r\n    from 0.017 to 0.98 \u00b5g (IARC, 1986). Higher blood lead and erythrocyte\r\n    protoporphyrin levels have been demonstrated in heavy smokers exposed\r\n    to lead (Williams et al., 1983; Landrigan & Straub, 1985); these could\r\n    have been partly due to contaminated cigarettes acting as vectors.\r\n    Other studies on occupationally exposed workers showed a progressive\r\n    increase in blood lead with an increase in the number of cigarettes\r\n    smoked (Maheswaren et al., 1993).\r\n\r\n    The association between lead exposure, tobacco smoke exposure and\r\n    blood pressure was examined in a cross-sectional study on 809 men\r\n    occupationally exposed to lead in a battery factory but only a small\r\n    increase in systolic blood pressure was found (Maheswaren et al.,\r\n    1993). There was no evidence of interactive effects between smoking\r\n    and lead exposure, but the absorbed lead from cigarettes added to the\r\n    body burden. 4.5  Rubber industry Some of the principal hazards in the industry are fumes, talc, carbon\r\n    black, chemical additives and organic solvents but the components of\r\n    the hazard mixture differ between different areas of work. A high risk\r\n    of pulmonary disease has been reported in the rubber industry. It was\r\n    elevated for smokers, particularly those employed in areas where there\r\n    were respirable particulates and/or solvents (Lednar et al., 1977).\r\n    The data suggested an interaction between smoking and hazards\r\n    encountered in mixing (particulates), extrusion (solvent sprays and\r\n    mould release agents), and curing (solvents and rubber reaction\r\n    products). A problem in epidemiological studies in the industry arises\r\n    because of movement of workers between jobs. Some high-risk workers\r\n\r\n    who were also smokers were involved in finishing and inspection but\r\n    they tended to be older employees who had worked in other areas before\r\n    moving to this particular job. Emphysema was the principal pulmonary\r\n    condition leading to premature termination of employment (Lednar et\r\n    al., 1977).\r\n\r\n    IARC (1987) classified the rubber industry as Group 1, based on\r\n    sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity to humans. Excess mortality\r\n    from cancers of various sites, the site usually being associated with\r\n    the nature of the work and types of exposure, has been reported with\r\n    bladder cancer being associated with exposure to aromatic amines (Fox\r\n    et al., 1974; Monson & Nakano, 1976a,b; Monson & Fine, 1978;\r\n    Kilpikari, 1982; IARC, 1987; Zhang et al., 1989; Weiland et al.,\r\n    1996). Lung cancer was associated with curing and inner tube\r\n    manufacture. The use of talc in the rubber industry has been\r\n    associated with pulmonary disease (Kleinfeld et al., 1973). In the\r\n    rubber industry the relative risk of lung cancer for talc-exposed\r\n    workers was 3.2 for men and 4.4 for women (Zhang et al., 1989),\r\n    compared with 2.5 times excess lung cancer risk in talc-using\r\n    industries not associated with rubber manufacture (Thomas & Stewart,\r\n    1986). In jobs where very high lung cancer rates were found, smoking\r\n    levels were also very high, but any possible interaction effect from\r\n    the two exposures could not be assessed.\r\n\r\n    Gastrointestinal cancer, bladder cancer and leukaemia were found to be\r\n    associated with jobs in the rubber industry (Monson & Fine, 1978;\r\n    IARC, 1987). Possible causes, such as exposure to carbon black,\r\n    plasticisers, antioxidants, arylamino compounds and benzene have been\r\n    suggested. Urine samples from rubber workers showed a higher mutagenic\r\n    activity in the middle of a working week than at the beginning of a\r\n    week in both smokers and non-smokers, indicating the presence of\r\n    mutagens in the work environment. In a study involving the analysis of\r\n    urine from rubber workers for mutagenic factors, a possible\r\n    synergistic effect of smoking and occupational exposure was found in\r\n    smokers (Wicklund et al., 1988). There was a relationship between skin\r\n    contamination and urinary mutagenicity (Bos et al., 1989). Other\r\n    studies involving the analysis of urine from rubber workers for\r\n    mutagenic factors also suggested a possible synergistic effect of\r\n    smoking and occupational exposure among smokers (Falk et al., 1980;\r\n    Crebelli et al., 1985).\r\n\r\n    Andjelkovich et al. (1988) carried out a case-control study of lung\r\n    cancer in workers at a rubber manufacturing plant. There was an\r\n    association between lung cancer mortality risk and work in certain\r\n    areas for smokers and non-smokers, and the risk was greater in\r\n    smokers. Zhang et al. (1989) studied a cohort of 957 men and 667 women\r\n    employed in a rubber factory. The relative risk of lung cancer for\r\n    smokers was 8.5 for men and 11.4 for women, and for those exposed to\r\n    curing agents or talc the relative risk was 3.2 for men and 4.6 for\r\n    women. Additive and multiplicative models were used to evaluate the\r\n    interaction between smoking and occupational exposure on lung cancer.\r\n    The additive interaction term was not statistically significant and\r\n\r\n    the multiplicative interaction was negative. Weiland et al. (1996)\r\n    were not able to find interactions between smoking and exposure in the\r\n    rubber industry. 4.6  Petroleum industry Petroleum refining involves exposure of workers to a large number of\r\n    chemical compounds occurring in crude oil or encountered in production\r\n    processes as intermediates, catalysts, additives or in the final\r\n    products. Because of fire risk, there are sections of the industry\r\n    where smoking is not permitted. However, in a study of 10 923 male and\r\n    624 female employees of the Australian petroleum industry between 1981\r\n    and 1984, it was found that the smoking habits did not differ\r\n    substantially from those of the general population (Christie et al.,\r\n    1986), and continued surveillance of these workers showed that\r\n    mortality rates were lower than for the general population (Christie\r\n    et al., 1987).\r\n\r\n    IARC (1989b) concluded that there is limited evidence that working in\r\n    petroleum refineries entails a carcinogenic risk. This limited\r\n    evidence applies to skin cancer and leukaemia; for all other cancer\r\n    sites on which information was available, the evidence was inadequate.\r\n    The overall evaluation, taking account of sufficient or limited\r\n    evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of various\r\n    distillates produced during petroleum refining, was that occupational\r\n    exposures in petroleum refining are probably carcinogenic to humans\r\n    (Group 2A).\r\n\r\n    In a study of 92 men with histologically confirmed renal cell\r\n    carcinoma (Domiano et al., 1985), it was concluded that there could be\r\n    an interaction between long-term gasoline exposure and heavy smoking.\r\n    In a case-control study of bladder cancer in New Jersey, USA, Najem et\r\n    al. (1982) found a significantly elevated risk of bladder cancer in\r\n    patients who had worked in the petroleum industry (OR, 2.5, CI, \r\n    1.2-5.5). While the risk was increased in current smokers (OR, 2.6), \r\n    it was higher in \"never smokers\" (OR, 5.6) and only slightly elevated \r\n    in ex-smokers (OR, 1.4). In another hospital-based study in Argentina \r\n    an association was found between bladder cancer and oil refinery work,\r\n    along with an elevated risk of lung cancer in smokers, but the numbers\r\n    were too few for any evaluation of the interaction (Iscovich et al.,\r\n    1987).\r\n\r\n    There was no increased mortality from either kidney cancer or\r\n    leukaemia in employees exposed to gasoline (Wong et al., 1993). A low\r\n    frequency of bladder cancer among refinery workers was attributed to\r\n    an assumed lower level of smoking among the group of workers studied\r\n    (Higginson et al., 1984).\r\n\r\n    In the study of workers occupationally exposed to gasoline vapour, the\r\n    sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency in peripheral blood\r\n    lymphocytes was used as an indicator of genotoxic response. Workers\r\n    employed in gasoline retail outlets were classified according to\r\n\r\n    cigarette smoking habits. The SCE frequency in lymphocytes was\r\n    unaffected by cigarette smoke or gasoline exposure alone, but\r\n    increased with combined exposure. The increased SCE frequency observed\r\n    in smokers occupationally exposed to gasoline vapour could be due to\r\n    the activation of hepatic enzymes by cigarette smoke, leading to a\r\n    greater formation of reactive metabolites of gasoline vapour (Edwards\r\n    & Priestly, 1993). 4.7  Pesticides A variety of chemical compounds, natural and synthetic, are used as\r\n    pesticides. The number of individuals exposed during manufacture is\r\n    relatively small, and processes are usually contained, but the\r\n    worldwide population of pesticide users is very large. Most of the\r\n    world's population is exposed to pesticide residues in food and\r\n    drinking-water (Ecobichon, 1995). There is some information concerning\r\n    effects on health from interaction of pesticide exposure and smoking.\r\n\r\n    \"Vineyard sprayer's lung\", is an occupational disease associated with\r\n    the spraying of copper-sulfate-based Bordeaux Mixture. In a study of\r\n    the cytological changes in the respiratory tract of vineyard workers\r\n    spraying Bordeaux Mixture (Plamenac et al., 1985), the macrophages of\r\n    control subjects contained no copper whereas copper was detected in\r\n    64% of the sprayers. Abnormal cytological changes in the sputum were\r\n    found in smokers, in sprayers and controls, and atypical squamous\r\n    metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium was observed in 29% of the\r\n    sprayers who were smokers.\r\n\r\n    In a study to evaluate the hypothesis that exposure to lead arsenate\r\n    resulted in an excess mortality from lung cancer, Wicklund et al.\r\n    (1988) compared 155 male orchard workers who had died of respiratory\r\n    cancer with 155 orchard workers who had died of other causes. Two\r\n    groups of non-orchard workers (620) were used as matched controls.\r\n    There was no difference in lead arsenate exposure between the orchard\r\n    worker group. Although cigarette smoking was common among the orchard\r\n    workers, their smoking habits were similar to the non-orchard worker\r\n    control groups. In both groups of orchard workers mortality from\r\n    respiratory cancer was higher in smokers than in non-smokers.\r\n\r\n    McDuffie et al. (1990) examined the possibility that pesticide use was\r\n    related to the risk of primary lung cancer. In a case-control study\r\n    using data from a population-based cancer registry, they interviewed\r\n    273 men and 103 women with diagnosed primary lung cancer and compared\r\n    their occupational exposures, medical history and working\r\n    characteristics with 187 male community control subjects. There was no\r\n    correlation of lung cancer risk with exposure to pesticides and\r\n    adjusting for smoking did not alter this. 5.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1  Conclusions 1.  Tobacco use, particularly smoking, is the single most important\r\n        public health hazard in the world today, and a major preventable\r\n        cause of morbidity and mortality.\r\n\r\n    2.  In addition to the adverse health effects of active tobacco use,\r\n        adverse health effects have also been demonstrated as a result of\r\n        exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\n    3.  The risks from tobacco smoke are demonstrably increased through\r\n        interactions with certain chemical, physical and biological\r\n        hazards found in the workplace and general environment.\r\n\r\n    4.  Based on this review of the scientific literature, additional\r\n        interactive effects, not yet identified, may exist.\r\n\r\n    5.  In addition to synergistic interactions between tobacco smoke and\r\n        other agents, a few instances of antagonistic interactions were\r\n        also noted. However, even in these cases, the health risks of\r\n        tobacco smoke far outweigh any apparent protective effects. 5.2  Recommendations for protection of human health 1.  All possible measures should be taken to eliminate tobacco use,\r\n        particularly smoking.\r\n\r\n    2.  In order to avoid interaction with occupational exposures, and\r\n        eliminate the risks of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,\r\n        smoking in the workplace should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n    3.  Smoking in public places should be strongly discouraged.\r\n\r\n    4.  In order to reduce the risks of exposure to environmental tobacco\r\n        smoke, particularly for children, smoking in domestic \r\n        environments should be strongly discouraged. Such action will also\r\n        avoid possible deleterious interactions between tobacco smoke and\r\n        residential exposures to other hazards.\r\n\r\n    5.  Awareness-building through active educational programmes on the\r\n        health hazards of smoking should be undertaken in both developed\r\n        and developing countries. This should include enhanced\r\n        communication about deleterious interactions between tobacco and\r\n        other agents. Governments, industry, health and educational\r\n        professionals, and the general public should share in this\r\n        responsibility.\r\n\r\n    6.  Since smoking may result in altered response or adverse reactions\r\n        to drugs and other therapeutic treatments, appropriate dose\r\n        adjustments and patient surveillance should be taken into\r\n        consideration by clinicians.\r\n\r\n    7.  Health professionals should provide assistance to smokers to stop\r\n        smoking. This may necessitate the allocation of additional\r\n        resources for this purpose. 6.  FURTHER RESEARCH 1.  A number of different methodological approaches to investigating\r\n        interactions currently exist. The feasibility of harmonizing\r\n        methodologies for the assessment of potential interactions\r\n        between two or more health hazards should be explored. In the\r\n        interim, investigators should make every effort to state clearly\r\n        which methodologies have been used when reporting their results.\r\n\r\n    2.  In many of the observational studies included in this review,\r\n        exposure data were limited. In order to improve future\r\n        investigations of interactions among human health hazards, more\r\n        complete and accurate exposure assessments should be performed.\r\n\r\n    3.  Further epidemiological investigations of potential interactions\r\n        between tobacco smoke and other hazards in both the occupational\r\n        and general environments are needed to identify additional\r\n        populations at risk. Such interactive effects can lead to risks\r\n        higher than would be predicted by separate analyses of the risks\r\n        associated with individual hazards.\r\n\r\n        Epidemiological investigations in countries where the health\r\n        effects of tobacco have not been extensively studied previously\r\n        are of particular importance. This information would be of value\r\n        in characterizing the morbidity and mortality due to tobacco use\r\n        in those countries.\r\n\r\n    4.  Additional research is needed to clarify the toxicological\r\n        mechanisms by which tobacco smoke leads to adverse health\r\n        effects, and by which tobacco smoke and other agents interact.\r\n        This information will be of use in the design and interpretation\r\n        of epidemiological studies on the health effects of tobacco,\r\n        including interactive effects.\r\n\r\n    5.  Additional epidemiological research on the health effects of\r\n        passive smoking, particularly carcinogenic, cardiorespiratory and\r\n        allergic effects, would be of value in characterizing the effects\r\n        of low levels of exposure to tobacco smoke. Interactions between\r\n        environmental tobacco smoke and other health hazards also warrant\r\n        further investigation.\r\n\r\n    6.  Established biomarker methods should be applied to the monitoring\r\n        of workers for the early detection of harmful exposures to toxic\r\n        or carcinogenic agents, and, in many areas, new biomarker methods\r\n        should be developed to improve hazard identification.\r\n        Consideration should be given to evaluating the ongoing exposure\r\n        of workers to active or passive tobacco smoke by monitoring\r\n        salivary or urinary cotinine, one of the major nicotine\r\n        metabolites.\r\n\r\n    7.  A comprehensive review of the adverse health effects of\r\n        environmental tobacco smoke should be undertaken. This review\r\n        would provide an authoritative summary of the health impacts of\r\n        environmental tobacco smoke, as well as interactions between\r\n        environmental tobacco smoke and other health hazards.

Introduction Le tabac, notamment lorsqu'il est fum\u00e9, exerce divers effets nuisibles\r\n    \u00e0 la sant\u00e9; il est directement en cause dans un certain nombre de\r\n    maladies graves et peut accentuer l'action nocive d'autres agents\r\n    chimiques, physiques ou biologiques. Les produits chimiques et autres\r\n    agents pr\u00e9sents sur les lieux de travail peuvent, si l'on n'y veille pas\r\n    suffisamment, provoquer diverses pathologies, des invalidit\u00e9s et des\r\n    d\u00e9c\u00e8s pr\u00e9matur\u00e9s. Il est clair que sur les lieux de travail, des effets\r\n    ind\u00e9sirables peuvent r\u00e9sulter de la synergie entre le tabagisme et\r\n    d'autres facteurs de risque. La plupart des interactions entre les\r\n    constituants nocifs de la fum\u00e9e de tabac et certaines substances\r\n    chimiques toxiques se produisent lorsque celles-ci sont pr\u00e9sentes dans\r\n    l'atmosph\u00e8re, mais le tabagisme peut \u00e9galement, comme on l'a observ\u00e9,\r\n    interagir avec des agents toxiques absorb\u00e9s par voie buccale ou autre.\r\n\r\n    La consommation de tabac est universelle, des pays \u00e9conomiquement\r\n    d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s aux nations industrialis\u00e9es les plus riches. Le tabac est\r\n    consomm\u00e9 par les hommes et les femmes, les enfants et les adultes et des\r\n    millions de gens sont expos\u00e9s malgr\u00e9 eux \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e de tabac pr\u00e9sente\r\n    dans l'environnement. Il y a de nombreuses explications au tabagisme,\r\n    mais la raison principale de son universalit\u00e9 tient \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence, dans\r\n    les feuilles de toutes les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s de tabac, de nicotine, une substance\r\n    qui engendre la d\u00e9pendance. Cette derni\u00e8re p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans l'organisme du\r\n    consommateur en quantit\u00e9 variable, selon le type de tabagisme auquel il\r\n    s'adonne (Chapitre 2). L'apparition de la cigarette, qui peut \u00eatre\r\n    produite en quantit\u00e9s industrielles, qu'il est facile de se procurer \u00e0\r\n    un prix relativement bas et que sa l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 permet de tenir entre les\r\n    l\u00e8vres en gardant les mains libres, a profond\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 le\r\n    comportement des fumeurs, que ce soit dans la vie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou sur les\r\n    lieux de travail.\r\n\r\n    Il y a beaucoup de pays o\u00f9 fumer est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tr\u00e8s dangereux pour\r\n    la sant\u00e9 et comme un facteur qui contribue de mani\u00e8re importante \u00e0 la\r\n    mortalit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant d'un certain nombre d'affections courantes. Ces pays\r\n    ont adopt\u00e9 une l\u00e9gislation qui vise \u00e0 alerter les consommateurs des\r\n    risques qu'ils courent et ils ont \u00e9galement pris des mesures pour\r\n    freiner la consommation, soit par la taxation, soit par la mise en\r\n    oeuvre de campagnes d'information \u00e0 destination du grand public qui ont\r\n    pour but d'attirer l'attention sur les dangers du tabagisme et les\r\n    avantages qu'il y a \u00e0 cesser de fumer ou \u00e0 ne pas commencer du tout.\r\n    Certains pays n'ont toutefois pas encore pris de mesures d\u00e9cisives pour\r\n    traiter le probl\u00e8me du tabagisme.\r\n\r\n    L'activit\u00e9 professionnelle comporte souvent une part de risque. Elle\r\n    peut \u00eatre de nature \u00e0 mettre la sant\u00e9 en danger et \u00e0 contaminer\r\n    l'environnement. La culture du tabac elle-m\u00eame implique l'utilisation de\r\n    pesticides, la r\u00e9colte des feuilles peut provoquer des intoxications\r\n    dues \u00e0 l'absorption percutan\u00e9e de nicotine et les diverses op\u00e9rations\r\n    auxquelles elles sont ensuite soumises expose les travailleurs \u00e0\r\n\r\n    respirer les poussi\u00e8res et les spores de champignons pr\u00e9sentes dans\r\n    l'atmosph\u00e8re. Dans les zones o\u00f9 sont implant\u00e9es des manufactures de\r\n    tabac, on observe une incidence \u00e9lev\u00e9e de cancers chez les sujets de\r\n    sexe masculin. L'air des exploitations mini\u00e8res est charg\u00e9 de poussi\u00e8res\r\n    min\u00e9rales et dans l'agriculture ou les industries qui utilisent des\r\n    mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res d'origine biologique, les travailleurs sont expos\u00e9s\r\n    \u00e0 des poussi\u00e8res de m\u00eame origine. Le soudage donne \u00e9galement lieu \u00e0 la\r\n    production de vapeurs, et les gaz, fum\u00e9es, brouillards etc. produits\r\n    dans de nombreuses industries sont aussi source de dangers. Une chaleur\r\n    excessive ou l'exposition aux ultraviolets peuvent nuire au bien-\u00eatre\r\n    des travailleurs. On admet d\u00e9sormais que les rayonnements ionisants \u00e9mis\r\n    dans les mines ou par certains appareils modernes constituent un risque\r\n    professionnel. Nombreuses sont les activit\u00e9s professionnelles qui\r\n    entra\u00eenent une exposition \u00e0 des niveaux de bruit excessifs ou \u00e0 des\r\n    vibrations nocives. Toutes ces conditions de travail ont des effets\r\n    ind\u00e9sirables sur la sant\u00e9, mais qui peuvent \u00eatre plus graves pour les\r\n    fumeurs que pour les non fumeurs. Dans un grand nombre de pays, il est\r\n    interdit de fumer sur les lieux de travail, essentiellement d'ailleurs\r\n    en raison des risques d'incendie ou d'explosion. Dans d'autres, cette\r\n    r\u00e9glementation n'est pas toujours appliqu\u00e9e. Dans certains pays\r\n    nouvellement industrialis\u00e9s, les probl\u00e8mes sanitaires li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9\r\n    professionnelle ne sont pas encore totalement pris en compte et de\r\n    nombreux employ\u00e9s et ouvriers ne sont pas conscients des risques de leur\r\n    m\u00e9tier sur le plan sanitaire. En outre, il existe un vaste secteur\r\n    industriel \"non officiel\", en particulier dans les pays en\r\n    d\u00e9veloppement, o\u00f9 le travail, qui se fait \u00e0 domicile, peut comporter\r\n    l'utilisation de produits chimiques (solvants, r\u00e9sines, colorants de\r\n    synth\u00e8se etc.) auxquels toute la famille va donc se trouver expos\u00e9e. En\r\n    outre, il n'existe pas de r\u00e9glementation qui restreigne l'exposition ou\r\n    interdise de fumer dans ces circonstances.\r\n\r\n    Beaucoup moins bien d\u00e9fini est le cas d'effets nocifs r\u00e9sultant de\r\n    l'action combin\u00e9e d'une exposition \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e de tabac, provenant du\r\n    courant principal ou de l'environnement, et \u00e0 des agents pr\u00e9sents dans\r\n    le milieu domestique. On sait toutefois qu'en ce qui concerne\r\n    l'incidence du cancer du poumon, la courbe dose-r\u00e9ponse obtenue dans le\r\n    cas d'une exposition domestique au radon est analogue \u00e0 celle qu'on\r\n    obtient chez des mineurs expos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce gaz, avec un risque plus important\r\n    chez les fumeurs. 2.  Exemples d'effets combin\u00e9s d'une exposition \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e de tabac et\r\n        \u00e0 d'autres agents On est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 penser que dans le cas de certains effets toxiques (en\r\n    l'occurrence le cancer) il existe une synergie entre le fait de fumer et\r\n    l'exposition \u00e0 l'arsenic, \u00e0 l'amiante, \u00e0 l'\u00e9thanol, \u00e0 la silice et aux\r\n    rayonnements (radon, bombe atomique, rayons X). D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il y a\r\n    \u00e9galement lieu de croire \u00e0 l'existence d'un antagonisme entre le\r\n    tabagisme et les chlorom\u00e9thyl\u00e9thers canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes comme le\r\n    chlorom\u00e9thyl-m\u00e9thyl\u00e9ther (CMME) et le bis (chlorom\u00e9thyl\u00e9ther) (BCME)\r\n    (Hoffmann & Winder, 1976; CIRC, 1986), entre le tabagisme et l'alv\u00e9olite\r\n    allergique ou encore entre le tabagisme et la b\u00e9rylliose chronique.\r\n\r\n    Fumer accentue les effets nocifs d'une exposition \u00e0 la poussi\u00e8re chez\r\n    les mineurs de charbon, ou aux pesticides chez ceux qui en manipulent,\r\n    et cette accentuation du risque s'observe \u00e9galement dans l'industrie du\r\n    caoutchouc et du p\u00e9trole. Les mineurs de charbon qui fument risquent\r\n    davantage de contracter une bronchite chronique ou une pneumopathie\r\n    obstructive, mais pas un emphys\u00e8me. Les cancers du poumon observ\u00e9s chez\r\n    les mineurs de charbon sont attribu\u00e9s en totalit\u00e9 au tabagisme. Fumer\r\n    peut accro\u00eetre les effets d'une exposition aux poussi\u00e8res v\u00e9g\u00e9tales qui\r\n    engendrent des affections respiratoires chroniques, comme la byssinose\r\n    produite par la poussi\u00e8re de coton et le cancer des fosses nasales\r\n    provoqu\u00e9 par la poussi\u00e8re de bois. 3.  Composition des feuilles et de la fum\u00e9e de tabac On a isol\u00e9 plus de 3040 compos\u00e9s chimiques des feuilles de tabac apr\u00e8s\r\n    transformation (Roberts, 1988). La plupart d'entre eux sont des\r\n    constituants de la feuille, mais d'autres r\u00e9sultent des conditions de\r\n    culture (sol et atmosph\u00e8re de la r\u00e9gion) ou encore des produits\r\n    agrochimiques utilis\u00e9s et des traitements subis (sau\u00e7age,\r\n    humidification, aromatisation et s\u00e9chage). On constate des diff\u00e9rences\r\n    selon la r\u00e9gion d'origine du tabac, les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s et les diverses\r\n    m\u00e9thodes de s\u00e9chage et de transformation utilis\u00e9es. Ces diff\u00e9rences\r\n    peuvent affecter la proportion des divers constituants mais la\r\n    composition globale ne varie pas. Parmi les importants compos\u00e9s toxiques\r\n    que l'on a mis en \u00e9vidence, on trouve, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la nicotine, des\r\n    nitrosamines canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes qui proviennent de l'action des nitrites, des\r\n    amines, des prot\u00e9ines et des alcalo\u00efdes d'origine foliaire, des\r\n    hydrocarbures aromatiques polycycliques form\u00e9s au cours du s\u00e9chage, des\r\n    \u00e9l\u00e9ments radioactifs capt\u00e9s dans le sol et dans l'air ainsi que du\r\n    cadmium dans le cas de tabacs cultiv\u00e9s sur des sols riches en cadmium.\r\n    Lorsque l'on fume, la combustion du tabac conduit \u00e0 la formation de\r\n    nombreux produits de pyrolyse ou r\u00e9sultant d'autres types de r\u00e9actions. 4.  Fum\u00e9e du courant principal La fum\u00e9e de tabac est un a\u00e9rosol consistant en une phase particulaire\r\n    constitu\u00e9e de gouttelettes de liquide dispers\u00e9es dans une phase gazeuse\r\n    ou vapeur. Lorsque l'on fume une cigarette, il se forme de nombreux\r\n    compos\u00e9s qui r\u00e9sultent de la pyrolyse du tabac. Ceux-ci peuvent, soit\r\n    traverser la cigarette dans la fum\u00e9e constituant le courant\r\n    principal-certains d'entre eux se condensant l\u00e9g\u00e8rement en arri\u00e8re du\r\n    c\u00f4ne incandescent-, soit pass\u00e9 dans l'air \u00e0 partir de l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9\r\n    incandescente, dans la fum\u00e9e qui constitue le courant lat\u00e9ral. A chaque\r\n    bouff\u00e9e, ces compos\u00e9s se concentrent dans la fum\u00e9e car les produits qui\r\n    s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 condens\u00e9s viennent s'y ajouter -- la zone de condensation\r\n    se r\u00e9duisant \u00e0 mesure que la cigarette se raccourcit. La nature\r\n    physicochimique de la fum\u00e9e d\u00e9pend du traitement subi par le tabac et de\r\n    sa combustion, de la porosit\u00e9 et du traitement du papier et du type de\r\n    bout-filtre (Hoffmann & Hoffmann, 1997). Dans le cas d'une cigarette ou\r\n    de ce que l'on appelle un \"bidi\" en Asie (du tabac roul\u00e9 dans la feuille\r\n    d'une plante), la composition chimique de la fum\u00e9e d\u00e9pend de facteurs\r\n    tels que les dimensions et la porosit\u00e9 de l'enveloppe ainsi que des\r\n\r\n    param\u00e8tres du fumage : volume, fr\u00e9quence et dur\u00e9e des bouff\u00e9es (NIH,\r\n    1998). Les variations de composition chimique concernent davantage la\r\n    proportion des diff\u00e9rents constituants que la pr\u00e9sence ou l'absence de\r\n    tel ou tel compos\u00e9.\r\n\r\n    La fum\u00e9e du courant principal est produite \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du c\u00f4ne\r\n    incandescent dans une atmosph\u00e8re relativement pauvre en oxyg\u00e8ne \u00e0 une\r\n    temp\u00e9rature de combustion de 850-950\u00b0C. Au d\u00e9part, les particules de\r\n    cette fum\u00e9e ont un diam\u00e8tre a\u00e9rodynamique massique m\u00e9dian (DAMM) de 0,2\r\n    \u00e0 0,3 \u00b5m; toutefois, d\u00e8s qu'elles p\u00e9n\u00e8trent dans les voies\r\n    respiratoires, o\u00f9 le degr\u00e9 d'humidit\u00e9 est de 100%, elles s'agr\u00e8gent pour\r\n    former des particules de plus grande taille et se comportent alors comme\r\n    si leur DAMM \u00e9tait de l'ordre du microm\u00e8tre. Environ 50 \u00e0 90% des\r\n    particules inhal\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre retenues dans les voies respiratoires\r\n    (Wynder & Hoffmann, 1967; Hinds et al., 1983). Pour des raisons d'ordre\r\n    dimensionnel, les particules pr\u00e9sentes dans l'a\u00e9rosol, les constituants\r\n    de la phase gazeuse et les gaz permanents sont capables d'atteindre les\r\n    alv\u00e9oles lors de l'inhalation de la fum\u00e9e. Le comportement des\r\n    constituants hydrophiles en pr\u00e9sence d'une forte humidit\u00e9 fait que le\r\n    d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans l'arbre trach\u00e9obronchique rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re complexe, mais\r\n    de toute mani\u00e8re, la fum\u00e9e s'insinue dans la totalit\u00e9 des voies\r\n    respiratoires.\r\n\r\n    Pr\u00e8s de 4000 constituants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s dans la fum\u00e9e du courant\r\n    principal \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'un nombre ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s de substances non identifi\u00e9es\r\n    (Roberts, 1988). La fum\u00e9e du courant principal comporte une phase\r\n    particulaire et une phase gazeuse. La phase particulaire contient de la\r\n    nicotine, des nitrosamines telles que la\r\n    4-(m\u00e9thylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NKK) et la N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), des m\u00e9taux comme le cadmium, le nickel, le\r\n    zinc et le polonium-210, des hydrocarbures polycycliques et des amines\r\n    canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes comme le 4-aminobiph\u00e9nyle. La phase gazeuse renferme du\r\n    monoxyde et du dioxyde de carbone, du benz\u00e8ne, de l'ammoniac, du\r\n    formald\u00e9hyde, du cyanure d'hydrog\u00e8ne, de la N-nitrosodim\u00e9thylamine, de\r\n    la N-nitrosodi\u00e9thylamine et un certain nombre d'autres compos\u00e9s. Les\r\n    compos\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents dans la fum\u00e9e de tabac peuvent, selon leurs effets\r\n    biologiques, \u00eatre class\u00e9s en asphyxiants, irritants, ciliatoxines,\r\n    mutag\u00e8nes, canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, inhibiteurs d'enzymes, neurotoxines ou d\u00e9riv\u00e9s\r\n    dot\u00e9s d'action pharmaceutique. C'est principalement par les voies\r\n    respiratoires que la fum\u00e9e de tabac p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans l'organisme mais de\r\n    nombreux constituants, pr\u00e9sents en particulier dans la fum\u00e9e de pipe et\r\n    de cigare, se dissolvent dans la salive et sont soit aval\u00e9s, soit\r\n    absorb\u00e9s au niveau de la cavit\u00e9 buccale. Les fumeurs de pipe et de\r\n    cigare n'inhalent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas la fum\u00e9e, qui demeure dans la cavit\u00e9\r\n    buccale o\u00f9, on vient de le voir, elle se dissout dans la salive et peut\r\n    \u00eatre soit absorb\u00e9e par passage \u00e0 travers la muqueuse buccale, soit \u00eatre\r\n    directement aval\u00e9e (NIH, 1998). Les boissons alcoolis\u00e9es, par leur effet\r\n    solvant sur les constituants de la fum\u00e9e, en facilitent la r\u00e9sorption. 5.  Fum\u00e9e du courant lat\u00e9ral La fum\u00e9e du courant lat\u00e9ral est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement produite \u00e0 une temp\u00e9rature\r\n    de combustion plus faible (500-600\u00b0C) dans une atmosph\u00e8re r\u00e9ductrice.\r\n    Les particules de cette fum\u00e9e ont, lorsqu'elles sont fra\u00eechement \u00e9mises,\r\n    une taille \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle des particules du courant\r\n    principal, avec un diam\u00e8tre a\u00e9rodynamique massique m\u00e9dian (DAMM)\r\n    d'environ 0,2 \u00b5m. Quantitativement, la composition de la fum\u00e9e du\r\n    courant lat\u00e9ral est analogue \u00e0 celle de la fum\u00e9e du courant principal.\r\n    Certaines substances du courant lat\u00e9ral sont \u00e9mises \u00e0 une concentration\r\n    (rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 1 g de tabac br\u00fbl\u00e9) plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que les constituants du\r\n    courant principal. C'est notamment le cas de compos\u00e9s canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes comme\r\n    la N-nitrosodim\u00e9thylamine et la N-nitrosodi\u00e9thylamine ou encore de\r\n    m\u00e9taux comme le nickel et le cadmium. Beaucoup de d\u00e9riv\u00e9s canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes\r\n    sont plus concentr\u00e9s dans la fum\u00e9e du courant lat\u00e9ral que dans celle du\r\n    courant principal. Des \u00e9preuves biologiques consistant \u00e0 badigeonner la\r\n    peau de souris avec un condensant de fum\u00e9e du courant lat\u00e9ral ont montr\u00e9\r\n    que ce dernier est plus canc\u00e9rog\u00e8ne que celui de la fum\u00e9e du courant\r\n    principal (Wynder & Hoffmann, 1967; US Surgeon General, 1986; NIH,\r\n    1998). 6.  La mani\u00e8re de fumer la cigarette et ses effets sur la toxicit\u00e9 de la\r\n        fum\u00e9e Les cigarettes n'ont pas toutes la m\u00eame teneur en nicotine et le fumeur\r\n    \"tire\" plus ou moins fort en inhalant plus ou moins profond\u00e9ment pour\r\n    satisfaire son besoin de nicotine. Il s'ensuit qu'en fumant une\r\n    cigarette \u00e0 bout-filtre pauvre en nicotine (< 1,2 mg) le fumeur va\r\n    tirer plus intens\u00e9ment, ce qui ne sera pas sans effet sur la toxicit\u00e9\r\n    (NIH, 1998). 7.  R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conclusions et des recommandations La consommation de tabac, notamment en le fumant, constitue un probl\u00e8me\r\n    de sant\u00e9 publique d'une extr\u00eame importance en raison de la morbidit\u00e9 et\r\n    de la mortalit\u00e9 qui en r\u00e9sultent. Outre les effets nocifs caus\u00e9s par une\r\n    utilisation active du tabac, on a montr\u00e9 qu'il en existe aussi qui\r\n    r\u00e9sultent de l'exposition passive \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente dans\r\n    l'environnement. Les dangers du tabagisme sont \u00e9galement accrus par la\r\n    possibilit\u00e9 d'interactions avec certains agents chimiques, physiques ou\r\n    biologiques pr\u00e9sents sur les lieux de travail ou dans l'environnement en\r\n    g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. On conna\u00eet certes quelques cas d'interactions antagonistes,\r\n    mais les risques inh\u00e9rents au tabagisme l'emportent de tr\u00e8s loin sur ses\r\n    effets protecteurs apparents. Tout doit \u00eatre mis en oeuvre pour faire\r\n    cesser la consommation de tabac et en particulier l'habitude de fumer.\r\n    Il faut s'opposer tr\u00e8s vigoureusement au tabagisme sur les lieux\r\n    publics. En outre, pour \u00e9viter des interactions avec d'autres types\r\n    d'exposition tout en \u00e9liminant le risque d'exposition passive \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e\r\n    de tabac, il faut interdire de fumer sur les lieux de travail.\r\n\r\n    Il faut aussi vivement inciter les gens \u00e0 ne pas fumer \u00e0 la maison afin\r\n    de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 de la famille et notamment celle des enfants. On\r\n    \u00e9vitera ainsi \u00e9galement des interactions potentiellement dangereuses\r\n    avec d'autres types d'exposition pouvant survenir dans l'environnement\r\n    domestique. Il est n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir sans attendre des programmes\r\n    \u00e9ducatifs sur les dangers du tabagisme pour la sant\u00e9. Les professionnels\r\n    de la sant\u00e9 doivent pr\u00eater assistance aux personnes qui d\u00e9sirent cesser\r\n    de fumer. Comme le tabagisme peut entra\u00eener une modification des\r\n    r\u00e9actions aux m\u00e9dicaments ou autres formes de traitement, voire susciter\r\n    \u00e0 leur encontre des r\u00e9actions ind\u00e9sirables, les m\u00e9decins doivent ajuster\r\n    les doses de leurs patients en cons\u00e9quence et surveiller leurs\r\n    r\u00e9actions. PANORAMA GENERAL 1. Introducci\u00f3n El consumo de tabaco, particularmente el h\u00e1bito de fumar, provoca una\r\n    serie de efectos nocivos para salud, est\u00e1 directamente relacionado con\r\n    varias enfermedades graves y puede aumentar los efectos adversos de\r\n    otros agentes qu\u00edmicos, f\u00edsicos y biol\u00f3gicos. Si no se controlan, los\r\n    agentes qu\u00edmicos y de otro tipo pueden producir en el puesto trabajo\r\n    enfermedades, discapacidades y la muerte prematura. Es evidente que en\r\n    el lugar de trabajo los efectos adversos pueden deberse a la interacci\u00f3n\r\n    sin\u00e9rgica del humo de tabaco con otros peligros. La mayor parte de las\r\n    interacciones de los constituyentes nocivos del humo de tabaco con\r\n    sustancias qu\u00edmicas t\u00f3xicas se producen cuando estas \u00faltimas est\u00e1n en el\r\n    aire, aunque se han notificado asimismo interacciones del humo con\r\n    agentes perjudiciales ingeridos y/o absorbidos.\r\n\r\n    El consumo de tabaco est\u00e1 generalizado en todo el mundo, desde los\r\n    pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos hasta los industrializados m\u00e1s ricos. Lo\r\n    utilizan hombres y mujeres, ni\u00f1os y adultos, y millones de personas\r\n    est\u00e1n involuntariamente expuestas al humo de tabaco en su entorno. Si\r\n    bien hay numerosas explicaciones del h\u00e1bito de fumar, la raz\u00f3n principal\r\n    de su ubicuidad es el efecto adictivo de la nicotina, droga presente en\r\n    todas las formas de la hoja de tabaco y que llega al consumidor en\r\n    cantidades variables seg\u00fan los distintos tipos de consumo  (cap\u00edtulo 2).\r\n    La aparici\u00f3n del cigarrillo, de producci\u00f3n masiva, f\u00e1cil de obtener,\r\n    relativamente econ\u00f3mico y ligero de peso, de manera que se puede llevar\r\n    en la boca dejando las manos libres, ha tenido repercusiones importantes\r\n    en el h\u00e1bito de fumar, tanto en general como en el puesto de trabajo.\r\n\r\n    En muchos pa\u00edses se reconoce que el humo de tabaco constituye un peligro\r\n    grave para la salud y es un factor que contribuye de manera importante\r\n    a la muerte causada por diversas enfermedades comunes. En esos pa\u00edses se\r\n    ha aplicado una legislaci\u00f3n de alerta sanitaria y medidas impositivas\r\n    para el control de su consumo, as\u00ed como programas de educaci\u00f3n del\r\n    p\u00fablico sobre los peligros del tabaco y las ventajas de no comenzar a\r\n    fumar o de interrumpir el consumo. Sin embargo, todav\u00eda hay pa\u00edses donde\r\n    no se han puesto en marcha medidas decisivas para abordar el problema\r\n    del consumo de tabaco.\r\n\r\n    Son muchas las situaciones laborales que conllevan un elemento de\r\n    riesgo. El tipo de trabajo puede generar efectos nocivos para salud y\r\n    las actividades laborales pueden provocar la contaminaci\u00f3n de medio\r\n    ambiente. El propio cultivo del tabaco requiere el uso de plaguicidas,\r\n    la recolecci\u00f3n de la hoja puede ocasionar trastornos debido a la\r\n    absorci\u00f3n de nicotina a trav\u00e9s de la piel y su elaboraci\u00f3n expone a los\r\n    trabajadores a peligros para la salud provocados por el polvo y las\r\n    esporas de hongos presentes en el aire. Se ha notificado una elevada\r\n    incidencia de c\u00e1ncer en el sexo masculino en zonas con industrias\r\n    tabaqueras. En la miner\u00eda existe polvo de minerales en el aire y en la\r\n    agricultura y la industria basadas en materias primas producidas\r\n    biol\u00f3gicamente hay polvo biol\u00f3gico. Durante las actividades de soldadura\r\n\r\n    se produce humo y en muchas industrias crean peligro los gases, humos,\r\n    neblinas y vapores cargados de sustancias org\u00e1nicas y/o inorg\u00e1nicas\r\n    t\u00f3xicas. Un calor excesivo o la  exposici\u00f3n a luz ultravioleta pueden\r\n    ser perjudiciales para el bienestar de los trabajadores. Est\u00e1 admitido\r\n    que las radiaciones ionizantes en la miner\u00eda y en la tecnolog\u00eda moderna\r\n    son un peligro en el lugar de trabajo. En numerosas actividades, los\r\n    trabajadores est\u00e1n expuestos a un ruido excesivo o a vibraciones\r\n    mec\u00e1nicas peligrosas. Estas condiciones laborales pueden afectar m\u00e1s\r\n    negativamente a la salud de las personas fumadoras que a la de las no\r\n    fumadoras. Son muchos los pa\u00edses en los que est\u00e1 prohibido fumar en el\r\n    trabajo, fundamentalmente por razones de seguridad en cuanto\r\n    incendios/explosiones. Sin embargo, en algunos pa\u00edses no siempre se\r\n    cumple la reglamentaci\u00f3n. En varios pa\u00edses recientemente\r\n    industrializados no se han abordado todav\u00eda plenamente los problemas de\r\n    salud asociados con el trabajo y muchos empleadores y trabajadores\r\n    desconocen los peligros para la salud de sus actividades. Adem\u00e1s, existe\r\n    un amplio \"sector extraoficial\" de la industria, particularmente en los\r\n    pa\u00edses en desarrollo, en que se trabaja en el hogar y se utilizan\r\n    sustancias qu\u00edmicas (en particular disolventes, resinas y colorantes\r\n    sint\u00e9ticos), estando expuesta toda la familia, y no hay restricciones\r\n    sobre la exposici\u00f3n a los peligros en el trabajo o al humo.\r\n\r\n    Est\u00e1 mucho menos definida la situaci\u00f3n en relaci\u00f3n con los efectos\r\n    adversos en la salud derivados de la exposici\u00f3n combinada al humo de\r\n    tabaco -- de la corriente principal o del medio ambiente -- y a los\r\n    agentes del entorno dom\u00e9stico. Sin embargo, la incidencia de c\u00e1ncer de\r\n    pulm\u00f3n y la concentraci\u00f3n de rad\u00f3n en los hogares tiene una relaci\u00f3n\r\n    dosis-respuesta similar a la que se produce entre el c\u00e1ncer de pulm\u00f3n y\r\n    la concentraci\u00f3n de rad\u00f3n en las minas, y el riesgo es m\u00e1s elevado para\r\n    los fumadores. 2.  Ejemplos de efectos combinados de la exposici\u00f3n al humo de\r\n        tabaco y a otras sustancias Est\u00e1 demostrada la existencia de sinergia en la producci\u00f3n de efectos\r\n    nocivos (c\u00e1ncer) entre el humo de tabaco y la exposici\u00f3n al ars\u00e9nico, el\r\n    amianto, el etanol, el silicio y las radiaciones (rad\u00f3n, bomba at\u00f3mica,\r\n    rayos X). Por otra parte, hay pruebas de antagonismo en el caso del humo\r\n    de tabaco y los clorometil\u00e9teres carcinog\u00e9nicos, es decir, el\r\n    clorometilmetil\u00e9ter (CMME) y el bis(clorometil)\u00e9ter (BCME) (Hoffmann y\r\n    Wynder, 1976; CIIC, 1986), el humo de tabaco y la alveolitis al\u00e9rgica y\r\n    el humo de tabaco y la beriliosis cr\u00f3nica. El humo de tabaco influye en\r\n    el riesgo para la salud  de la exposici\u00f3n en la extracci\u00f3n de carb\u00f3n, el\r\n    manejo de plaguicidas y las industrias del caucho y el petr\u00f3leo. Los\r\n    trabajadores de las minas de carb\u00f3n que fuman tienen un riesgo m\u00e1s\r\n    elevado de contraer bronquitis cr\u00f3nica y enfermedades obstructivas de\r\n    las v\u00edas respiratorias, pero no enfisema. El c\u00e1ncer de pulm\u00f3n de los\r\n    mineros del carb\u00f3n se ha atribuido totalmente al humo de tabaco. El humo\r\n    de tabaco puede aumentar el riesgo para salud de la exposici\u00f3n a polvos\r\n    vegetales que producen trastornos respiratorios cr\u00f3nicos, como la\r\n    bisinosis debida al polvo del algod\u00f3n y el c\u00e1ncer nasal provocado por el\r\n    polvo de la madera. 3.  Composici\u00f3n de la hoja del tabaco y del humo de tabaco De las hojas de tabaco elaboradas se han aislado m\u00e1s de 3040 compuestos\r\n    qu\u00edmicos (Roberts, 1988). La mayor\u00eda son constituyentes de la hoja, pero\r\n    la presencia de algunos depende de las condiciones de cultivo, como el\r\n    suelo y la atm\u00f3sfera de la zona, mientras que otros se derivan del uso\r\n    de productos qu\u00edmicos agr\u00edcolas, de revestimientos, humectantes y\r\n    aromatizantes a\u00f1adidos a las hojas y de los m\u00e9todos de curado. Las\r\n    diferentes variedades de tabaco que se cultivan en los distintos pa\u00edses,\r\n    as\u00ed como las distintas formas de curado y elaboraci\u00f3n, ponen de\r\n    manifiesto diversas diferencias. Las proporciones de los distintos\r\n    constituyentes pueden ser diferentes, pero no la composici\u00f3n general.\r\n    Entre los compuestos t\u00f3xicos importantes identificados, aparte de la\r\n    nicotina, figuran nitrosaminas carcinog\u00e9nicas, derivadas de nitritos,\r\n    aminas, prote\u00ednas y alcaloides presentes en la hoja, hidro-carburos\r\n    arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos procedentes del proceso de curado, elementos\r\n    radiactivos absorbidos del suelo y el aire, y cadmio en el tabaco\r\n    cultivado en suelos ricos en este elemento. Cuando se quema tabaco al\r\n    fumar, se forman numerosos productos derivados de la pir\u00f3lisis y de\r\n    otras reacciones. 4.  Corriente principal del humo de tabaco El humo del tabaco es un aerosol formado por una fase particulada de\r\n    gotitas de l\u00edquido dispersas en una fase de gas/vapor. Al fumar un\r\n    cigarrillo se forman numerosos compuestos por la pir\u00f3lisis del tabaco.\r\n    \u00c9stos pasan a trav\u00e9s del cigarrillo en la corriente principal del humo,\r\n    condens\u00e1ndose algunos a corta distancia detr\u00e1s del cono de combusti\u00f3n,\r\n    o bien se emiten en el aire a partir del extremo que se quema como humo\r\n    lateral. En cada bocanada el humo se hace progresivamente m\u00e1s fuerte,\r\n    porque se le a\u00f1ade material previamente condensado y porque la longitud\r\n    del cigarrillo disponible para la ulterior condensaci\u00f3n disminuye. Las\r\n    caracter\u00edsticas fisicoqu\u00edmicas del humo dependen de la elaboraci\u00f3n y la\r\n    combusti\u00f3n del tabaco, la porosidad y el tratamiento del papel en el que\r\n    est\u00e1 envuelto y del tipo de filtro (Hoffman y Hoffman, 1997). En el caso\r\n    de un cigarrillo o \"bidi\" asi\u00e1tico (tabaco envuelto en hoja vegetal), la\r\n    qu\u00edmica del humo se ve afectada por factores tales como las dimensiones,\r\n    la porosidad de la envoltura y los par\u00e1metros del volumen, la frecuencia\r\n    y la duraci\u00f3n de la bocanada de humo (NIH, 1998). Las variaciones en la\r\n    qu\u00edmica del humo se dan fundamentalmente en la proporci\u00f3n entre sus\r\n    constituyentes, m\u00e1s que en la presencia o ausencia de compuestos\r\n    concretos.\r\n\r\n    El humo de la corriente principal se genera en una atm\u00f3sfera con un\r\n    contenido comparativamente bajo de ox\u00edgeno a una temperatura de\r\n    combusti\u00f3n de 850-950\u00b0C en el cono de combusti\u00f3n. Al principio, las\r\n    part\u00edculas presentes en la corriente principal tienen un di\u00e1metro\r\n    aerodin\u00e1mico medio de la masa (MMAD) de 0,2 a 0,3 micras; sin embargo,\r\n    en cuanto llegan al tracto respiratorio, con una humedad del 100%, se\r\n    unen para formar part\u00edculas mayores y se comportan como si su MMAD fuera\r\n    del orden de micras. En el tracto respiratorio se puede retener\r\n    alrededor del 50-90% de todas las part\u00edculas inhaladas (Wynder y\r\n    Hoffmann, 1967; Hinds et al., 1983). Por lo que se refiere al tama\u00f1o, al\r\n\r\n    inhalar el humo pueden llegar a los alv\u00e9olos las part\u00edculas en aerosol,\r\n    los constituyentes de la fase de vapor y los gases permanentes. La\r\n    deposici\u00f3n en el \u00e1rbol traqueobronquial se ve complicada por el\r\n    comportamiento de los constituyentes hidrof\u00edlicos en condiciones de\r\n    humedad elevada, pero el humo llega a todas las partes de las v\u00edas\r\n    respiratorias.\r\n\r\n    El humo de la corriente principal contiene cerca de 4000 sustancias\r\n    qu\u00edmicas identificadas y un n\u00famero desconocido de sustancias qu\u00edmicas\r\n    sin identificar (Roberts, 1988). El humo de la corriente principal se\r\n    puede dividir en una fase de part\u00edculas y otra de gas. La fase de\r\n    part\u00edculas contiene nicotina, nitrosaminas como la\r\n    4-(metilnitrosamino)-1-(3-piridil)-1-butanona (NNK) y la N-nitrosonornicotina (NNN), metales como el cadmio, el n\u00edquel, el zinc\r\n    y el polonio-210, hidrocarburos polic\u00edclicos y aminas carcinog\u00e9nicas,\r\n    como el 4-aminobifenilo. La fase de vapor contiene mon\u00f3xido de carbono,\r\n    anh\u00eddrido carb\u00f3nico, benceno, amon\u00edaco, formaldeh\u00eddo, cianuro de\r\n    hidr\u00f3geno, N-nitrosodimetilamina, N-nitrosodietilamina y otros\r\n    compuestos. Los compuestos del humo de tabaco se pueden clasificar por\r\n    su actividad biol\u00f3gica como asfixiantes, irritantes, ciliatoxinas,\r\n    mut\u00e1genos, carcin\u00f3genos, inhibidores de las enzimas, neurotoxinas o\r\n    compuestos farmacol\u00f3gicamente activos. El principal punto de entrada del\r\n    humo del cigarrillo en el organismo es por las v\u00edas respiratorias, pero\r\n    muchos constituyentes, en particular del humo de pipa y de cigarro, se\r\n    disuelven en la saliva y se absorben en la cavidad bucal o se ingieren.\r\n    Los fumadores de cigarros y de pipa no suelen inhalar el humo, que\r\n    permanece en la cavidad bucal, se disuelve en la saliva y se absorbe a\r\n    trav\u00e9s de las membranas mucosas o se ingiere (NIH, 1998). Las bebidas\r\n    alcoh\u00f3licas tienen un efecto disolvente de los constituyentes del humo,\r\n    facilitando su absorci\u00f3n. 5.  Humo de tabaco lateral El humo lateral se forma con una temperatura de combusti\u00f3n m\u00e1s baja\r\n    (500-600\u00b0C) en una atm\u00f3sfera reductora. Las part\u00edculas del humo lateral\r\n    fresco son pr\u00e1cticamente del mismo tama\u00f1o que las de la corriente\r\n    principal, con un di\u00e1metro aerodin\u00e1mico medio de la masa de alrededor de\r\n    0,2 micras. Desde el punto de vista cualitativo, la composici\u00f3n del humo\r\n    lateral es semejante a la del humo de la corriente principal. Algunas\r\n    sustancias qu\u00edmicas se emiten en el humo lateral con una concentraci\u00f3n\r\n    mayor por gramo de tabaco quemado que en el humo de la corriente\r\n    principal. Esto es particularmente aplicable a carcin\u00f3genos como la N-nitrosodimetilamina y la N-nitrosodietilamina y a metales como el\r\n    n\u00edquel o el cadmio. Muchos compuestos carcin\u00f3genos est\u00e1n m\u00e1s\r\n    concentrados en el humo lateral que en el principal. En biovaloraciones\r\n    con aplicaci\u00f3n a la piel de ratones se ha demostrado que el humo lateral\r\n    condensado es m\u00e1s carcinog\u00e9nico que el principal (Wynder y Hoffmann,\r\n    1967; US Surgeon General, 1986; NIH, 1998). 6.  Efectos de la manera de fumar los cigarrillos en la\r\n        toxicidad del humo El contenido de nicotina de los distintos cigarrillos var\u00eda, y el\r\n    fumador, para satisfacer la necesidad adquirida de nicotina, la ajusta\r\n    mediante la intensidad con la que fuma y la profundidad de la\r\n    inhalaci\u00f3n. Por consiguiente, el fumador de cigarrillos con filtro y de\r\n    contenido bajo en nicotina (< 1,2 mg) fuma con mayor intensidad, y esto\r\n    influye en la toxicidad (NIH, 1998). 7.  Resumen de las conclusiones y recomendaciones El consumo de tabaco, en particular el h\u00e1bito de fumar, representa un\r\n    peligro para la salud p\u00fablica de la m\u00e1xima importancia y es una causa\r\n    prevenible importante de morbilidad y mortalidad. Adem\u00e1s de los efectos\r\n    adversos del consumo activo de tabaco para la salud, se han demostrado\r\n    efectos adversos derivados de la exposici\u00f3n al humo de tabaco presente\r\n    en el medio ambiente.

De esta\r\n    manera se previenen posibles interacciones perjudiciales entre el humo\r\n    de tabaco y la exposici\u00f3n a otros peligros en la vivienda.

Los profesionales de la salud deber\u00edan\r\n    prestar asistencia para ayudar a los fumadores a dejar este h\u00e1bito.\r\n    Debido a que el humo puede provocar una alteraci\u00f3n de la respuesta a los\r\n    medicamentos y otros tratamientos o una reacci\u00f3n adversa a \u00e9stos, los\r\n    m\u00e9dicos deber\u00edan estudiar la posibilidad de introducir ajustes\r\n    apropiados de la dosificaci\u00f3n y vigilar a los pacientes.\n"}, {"score": 462.56427, "uuid": "ea7671b7-1647-5d51-9308-dcdfe956709e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1108wb-71-23625", "target_hostname": "www.52marathons.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.52marathons.co.uk/node/18?page=2", "page_rank": 1.1815673e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "The blog <em>of</em> a man who <em>is</em> running 52 marathons <em>in</em> 2011 - starting on New", "snippet": "With the copy <em>of</em> the purchase contract <em>in</em> his hand, he <em>is</em> <em>in</em> a <em>better</em> position to determine whether your Steel Stampings will be approved by the building code office <em>or</em> not.", "explanation": null, "document": "The blog of a man who is running 52 marathons in 2011 - starting on New Year's Day!!!\nSubmitted by Kevin Betts on Fri, 12/31/2010 - 17:44\nNew year, new challenge.\nHi everyone. So this is the first blog of the new year and with it comes a new challenge. This year I\u2019ve charged myself with the task of completing 52 sub-4 hour marathons.\nLast year I ran a few marathons/ultramarathons and it turned out to be a hell of a challenge. I laughed, cried, bled, wee\u2019d myself, enjoyed it, hated it, fel over, stood in numerous dog shits and generally had a whale of a time. It was a hell of an achievement and one of the things I enjoyed most was blogging about it. So I will be doing it again this year!\nSo why do something else? Why not have some time off and do something else? It\u2019s the mental challenge, I think. I read a book earlier this year my Mike Stroud that suggested that once the intense pain of an event is over, we are quick to forget it and can\u2019t fathom just how much it hurt until we do it again. Apparently it\u2019s why women are eager to give birth again after their first. That, and some sort of bond that adults and children allegedly develop throughout the years\u2026\nThere is of course the obligatory charity challenge. I wouldn\u2019t bother if it was just for myself. I want motivation beyond my own ego, and hopefully people will benefit from it in the form of money, promotion and raised awareness.\nSo this year they are:\nPassingiton www.passingiton.org.uk\nRethink \u2013 Survivors of Suicide www.rethink.org\nI have to have the obligatory suicide charity in there \u2013 and this one is local to Brighton. I don\u2019t think I would be motivated enough if dad hadn\u2019t have topped himself \u2013 something good has to come of it. BUT, there\u2019s plenty of time in the next year to discuss the ins and outs of the effects of suicide.\nPassingiton is an amazing Brighton based charity. Run by two cracking blokes, James and Matt, with the help of lots of great well wishers, they have gone from running the Dublin Marathon dressed as Batman and Robin to staging a World Record breaking Heroes run on Brighton seafront each year. www.heroesrun.org.uk for more information. Further to this, James is acting as my PR machine. For this, I\u2019m eternally grateful!\nSo here goes \u2013 tomorrow is New Years Day and already we\u2019ve hit a snag. We\u2019re unable to make the Brooks Serpentine 10km, so I\u2019m playing cat and mouse with James instead. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013\nI am running setting off from Shoreham train station at 1.30pm. James will leave Brighton at the same time. We will both head to Newhaven swing bridge and back, finishing within 4 hours. Question is, will I catch him before he gets there? Doubtful if you ask me \u2013 I\u2019ve done naff all, all Christmas!\nFinally, a huge thank you for reading this \u2013 please keep checking back. The website is very important and will be updated as much as possible. There will be many more insights into how it\u2019s all going and hopefully some great tales of support. I\u2019ve already had people get in touch with their best wishes. I always want to hear from people.

However, unique and meaningful ideas can be a daunting task. Gifts that keep giving and growing are a perfect solution. Plants are not just beautiful, but also cheer up any space and even improve air quality in a home or office space.\nWhen gifting plants:\nGive care:\nAlways include care instructions for the plant gift. Even the most experienced indoor plant grower appreciates a little help. Most live goods come with suggested light feeding and watering recommendations. If the plant selected does not have these care instructions, ask before leaving the nursery so the recipient can keep this lovely gift green.\nCustomize the plant to the person:\nFlowers, succulents, cacti, tropicals and even bulbs can make great presents. The varieties and combinations are as endless as the personalities on your gift list. It is important to match the plant to the recipient. For instance, a plant needing daily watering would not make a good gift for a constant traveler. Instead, give them an interesting cactus or succulent, which needs less frequent care. For an artistic friend, try a terrarium that can be customized to their tastes. The more sophisticated giftee may appreciate a colorful and delicate orchid. For those with asthma or allergies, plants like palms, peace lilies and ferns do an excellent job of improving air quality and filtering out toxins.\nContainers make a difference:\nThose boring, plastic pots that house most plants are not very attractive or personal. Pop your plants into colorful ceramic, glass, wood or even metal containers for a more interesting and personal touch. Inexpensive terra cotta pots can be painted in bright or metallic-colored paint, large coffee cups as containers can add a quirky element or baskets can be lined with plastic and used to hold small pots. When repotting plants yourself, make sure to use a high-quality potting mix such as Miracle-Gro Potting Mix or Miracle-Gro Organic Choice Potting Mix. Also, keep in mind that specialty plants like cacti, African violets and orchids may perform better in special potting mixes. When in doubt, ask the nursery for recommendations. For presentation, wrap foil, paper or cellophane around the outside of the container and use fabric bows or raffia to add a finishing touch.\nPlants at the party:\nLittle gifts from nature go a long way in spreading the holiday cheer to friends, family and neighbors. When hosting a party, offer little mementos for your guests to take home. Try a small terra cotta pot painted gold and planted with rosemary or thyme and tied with a lovely ribbon Or, maybe small, colorful pots filled with soil and a bulb to add a pop of spring to the winter months. Add a photo of the flower your guest can expect and directions on forcing the bulb to the gift tag. Whether paying a call on friends or attending a party, host or hostess gifts are another fun way to spread holiday cheer. Poinsettia, amaryllis and Christmas cactus are seasonal favorites.\nPlants make excellent gifts and will be a reminder of the good times you shared.\n"}, {"score": 439.28827, "uuid": "8f4de8ec-fdc0-56de-97da-31522b8af034", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0812wb-12-26850", "target_hostname": "waverley-leader.whereilive.com.au", "target_uri": "http://waverley-leader.whereilive.com.au/local-info/story/council-services-in-waverley/rea.buy/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Council services <em>in</em> Waverley - Services - Local Info - Waverley Leader", "snippet": "Approved items are food scraps, meat, nappies (wrapped), <em>ceramics</em>, paper, window glass, mirrors, pyrex, light bulbs, wrapped vacuum dust, non-recyclable <em>plastics</em> such as bags and <em>plant</em> <em>pots</em>.

When we bring plants home, it's important to remember that we bring their preferences with them. We need to know what conditions they needed in their natural habitat such as light, water, temperature and humidity and try to meet those requirements.\nLight Requirements\nLight is the most critical factor in growing interior plants successfully. What light intensity do you have?\nLight can be described as follows:\nFull sun \u0096 5 hours of sun, southern window\nSome sun \u0096 less that 5 hours of sun, within 2 ft of a southern window, in an east/west window\nBright light \u0096 within 5 ft of any window that gets some sun.\nMedium light - 5-8 ft from a sunny window or directly in a northern window\nLow light \u0096 receiving indirect light only such as a corner or hall\nA few tips about light\nLight duration is the total amount of light a plant gets in a 24-hour period. Sometimes a plant can grow in less intense light than recommended if it receives lower light for a longer time.\nLight quality is the source of light energy, whether sun or artificial. If there isn't enough natural light you can supplement with artificial light.\nFlowering plants generally require more light that non-flowering. Foliage plants with variegated leaves need more light than plants with solid green leaves.\nWater Requirements\nWhen do you water and how much? This is extremely important. Over-watering is the number one cause of interior plant death.\nWater Frequency\nDo not water on a schedule. Water only as needed. There are many factors that determine when to water.\nThe Plant Variety \u0096 know your plant and its requirements. A cactus needs much less frequent watering than a primrose.\nThe Container \u0096 the soil in clay pots dries out much more quickly that that in plastic or glazed ceramic.\nThe Potting Soil \u0096 Every soil holds water differently. Soils with organic material hold water better than those with more drainage material.\nThe Light \u0096 a plant in bright light will need more frequent watering than the same plant in lower light.\nThe Stage of Growth \u0096 actively growing plants need more frequent watering than dormant plants.\nThe Size of the Plant \u0096 a 4-inch plant requires more frequent watering than the same 10-inch plant, which holds moisture longer.\nHanging Plants \u0096 as a rule they need more frequent watering because it is warmer closer to the ceiling.\nTemperature \u0096 when the temperature is warmer, plants need more frequent watering.\nHumidity \u0096 the less humid the home, the more frequent you need to water.\nThick Leaved Plants \u0096 as a rule they require less frequent watering because of their ability to store water.\nWater Amount\nBasically when watering, water thoroughly allowing water to go completely through the plant so that the complete root system is watered, and also so that salts that collect in the soils are washed out.\nDo not allow plants to sit in water. Empty excess from saucer.\nMoist-not-wet, as a general rule.\nDo not allow soil to become \"bone\" dry.\nIn reading about your particular plant requirements you will run into several terms. Here are their definitions.\nKeep evenly moist: soil should be wet throughout but not soggy. Water when the surface feels dry.\nWater when dry: when you put our finger 1 inch down in the soil and it's dry, it's time to water.\nAllow to dry: water when the soil is dry between 1-2 inches deep. Allow to dry completely; as in cacti and succulents.\nTemperature Requirements\nMost plant prefer 65-75\u00b0 F. during the day and 10\u00b0 less at night. Extended time below 50\u00b0 F. can damage foliage plants and cause leaf drop or discoloration. All plants have a temperature range where they grow best. It would be good to know what your plant prefers.\nHumidity Requirements\nMost plants prefer humidity over 30%. Homes and offices in the winter usually have less than that. You can do several things to meet those humidity requirements.\nUse a humidifier.\nPlace plants on pebbles in a tray of water (the plant pot bottom should not sit in the water).\nGroup plants together.\nMist with a mister bottle (especially ferns).\nWe have covered the four major requirements (light, water, temperature, humidity) for plants but also key to interior plant success are fertilizing, soil, repotting and grooming.\nFertilizer\nAs a general rule: when in doubt, don't fertilize.\nIt is not a medicine for sick plants. Fertilizer does not magically correct a water or light problem. (Darn!)\nWait 6 months before fertilizing a newly purchased plant. Most growers use slow release fertilizers. If you fertilize on top of that, you could burn roots.\nFollow directions on the package and do not make the mixture stronger than manufacturers recommendations. Too frequent or too strong can damage or kill your plant.\nSoil\nThere are a wide variety of soils available. Your goal is to get a well-balanced soil that holds water but allows for good drainage.\nDo not use native soil \u0096 because of possible pathogens and/or weeds.\nDo not use topsoil \u0096 often very heavy.\nThe plant determines the type of soil you should use. A cactus needs very well drained, sandy soil.\nRe-potting\nPlants need re-potting when they start to need water more frequently than normal, and when their roots encompass the soil in the pot, forming a heavy circle at the base of the plant. Take the plant out of the pot and see if you have evidence of root-crowding.\nUse a good basic potting soil and put rocks in the bottom of the pot and then a layer of soil.\nIf roots encompass the soil mass, cut them from top to bottom in 3 or 4 spots.\nPot up into the next size pot (example: a 6 inch pot re-pots into an 8 inch pot).\nDon't plant deeper than it was in the previous pot.\nBe sure sides are filled with soil, press gently, then rap bottom of pot on hard surface several times to get out air pockets.\nWater thoroughly until it runs through the drainage hole.\nPlant Grooming\nShape the plant by pruning, or pinching back the growing tips.\nPrune out damaged or sick areas. The plant will then put energy into new growth.\nRemove faded blooms so energy goes back into flower production.\nOccasionally wash leaves with water and a soft sponge so the plant's stomata are clear.\nBy knowing your home or office light intensity you can pick a plant for any corner of your home or office. Then meet the other requirements such as temperature, humidity, and proper watering and you'll have your own interior plant success story!\nOur goal is to help you be successful by helping you choose the right plant for your home or office and to answer questions you might have about keeping them looking good long term.\nWe offer many long lasting interior landscape floor plants, hanging plants and a good variety of 3 and 4-inch plants for dish gardens and windowsills. In addition, we have a constantly changing selection of flowering plants, cactus, succulents and citrus plants, depending on the season. Later in the spring we have the larger tropical orange trees, lemon, tangerine, and hibiscus trees so you can really create a tropical paradise in your home.\nIf you don't see the plant you are searching for, please ask: we will try to find it for you.\n\u00a9Copyright O'Donal's Nursery, Inc.\n"}, {"score": 412.7291, "uuid": "a3a79784-1672-57e5-b964-7eb08afa15f5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0501wb-10-30174", "target_hostname": "www.hbci.com", "target_uri": "http://www.hbci.com/%7Ewenonah/tommy/do.htm", "page_rank": 1.3648889e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Tommy&#x27;s Grand Adventure <em>of</em> Discovery", "snippet": "<em>Plants</em> display visual symptoms regarding the state <em>of</em> their <em>health</em> <em>which</em> <em>is</em> a reflection <em>of</em> their ability to extract the minerals they need from the growth medium.", "explanation": null, "document": "My Grand Adventure of Discovery\n( A Half Century Report for Myself, My Friends and Investors )\n( As Always, You Can Resize My Windows \u0097 Maximize Yours \u0097 Click here for Tips \u0097 Click here for frames )\nI think its really neat to be able to sit back and consider the years and say to yourself, \u00a0 \" WOW, \u00a0 What a Grand Adventure My Life Has Been ! \u00a0 If the next fifty years are as intense as the first fifty years of my life \u00a0 ... \u00a0 \u00a0 Kaaa\u0097\u0097POW ! \" \u00a0 I've witnessed our planet's rapid development of technology close up. I've spent my years working with key industries designing and installing new technology, creating new products. From my perspective, the future is bright with exciting possibilities.\nToday, we are being presented with more options than ever. It seems that an endless stream of new discoveries and inventions are presented to us each day. We've demonstrated, what we as a nation are capable of when we put one of our citizens on the moon's surface. The team work involved was tremendous. Our imaginative powers were put to the task of creating the many different devices that were needed for accomplishing the task of getting to the moon and back, with the best technology known at the time. The project brought a open time of discovery and invention. There was large scale dissemination of information.\nAs soon as something new was discovered, the information was published. New materials were created from Nature's atomic erector set. New ways of doing old tasks were perfected. Our creative urges were being fulfilled with thoughts of being part of a positive, exciting project.\nAfter the moon missions, our society continued to unfold the possibilities of Nature's erector set construction. But, with the atmosphere of the \"Cold War\" the disseminate of new discoveries was not as open. Companies claimed a right to withhold information regarding new discoveries. Nationally, technology was developed for the sole purpose of creating greater weapons of destruction.\nThankfully, the attitude of openness is returning. The National Labs have been given the mandate to assist with the transfer of technology, developed for the military, into the commercial business sector. Wonderful new worlds of possibilities loom before us. Our ever increasing understanding of the atomic nature of our world has given us the ability to create natural materials in a new way, plus, a whole fascinating tool kit full of new exotic materials. We have learned to enhance biological environments and can increase the growth rate of almost anything we desire. All that is necessary to realize the great benefits available to us is a slight change of outlook. Acknowledging that we are part of global system. That all things are interlinked in one amazing clock\u0096works.\nIn the past we have introduced materials and manufacturing processes without duly considering the influences that these marvelous things have on our own personal biology and the planetary system of which we are a part. We are now just beginning to understand the incredible disaster we have rained down upon us. We are being poisoned by our water pipes, cookware, china, flaking paint pigments, auto emissions, herbicides, bug sprays, even the dyes we use to color our cloths have the potential to be harmful, especially when mixed in combinations. Happily, just a slight shift in our present conscientious allows an imaginative mind to implement scientific principles. If You allow yourself to view all happenings from the perspective of environments, a remarkable cohesiveness is apparent.\nWe simply need to move past our symptomatic treatment of sociological and biological issues and address the causal realities. If our approach is only to treat the diseases or their symptoms, the true causes, the real source of the disease may continually go unnoticed. If we can learn to prevent the disease entirely the benefits should be obvious and many.\nWe can no longer return to the land and live as the original Native Americans or early immigrants. We have burned the bridges of our past culture, through our disruption of the natural balanced echo-system. Fortunately, our technology has given us the wherewithal to not only reverse the effects we have had on our ecology, but to enhance the life force on this planet to an almost unimaginable level. The horn of plenty can easily be made available to everyone, thereby reducing the stresses that promote disharmony.\nLife can only flourish in a very narrow range of environmental values. Too cold, too hot is a simple example we all know. The same holds true for air, water and the mineral content of the medium. Very small changes can have very dramatic effects. Some elements need to be controlled in parts per Billion. ( 1 X 10\u00969 ). That notation may seem small, but an ounce of iron actually has more than 977,648,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 individual iron atoms in it. So, as Einstein said, \"Its all relative.\" That is ... Related!\nThe mysteries of nature have been slowly unfolded for me during an incredible journey of discovery. We are all equipped with a marvelous array of senses that go far beyond the presently known six physical senses . One of these is termed by psychologists as the sense of homeostasis. Put simply, the feeling that everything is alright. All systems check 'A' OK !\nBack in the fall of '71', I was unconsciously heading into my usual winter slow down. The dramatic loss of energy was usually accompanied by frustration in my level of performance and often resulted in a cycle of depression. The idea occurred to me that I always seemed to have more energy when there was green growing things around. So I planted some bean seeds and watched them sprout. Their tiny leaves growing ever larger. Each day the little leaves would lift themselves up and track the sun, actually follow the sun across the sky. And then one day the little bean plants took sick and soon died. So I planted some more seeds and went out and bought some plant food and fed them really good, and guess what ? These plants died in less time than the first group.\nNow, this was a real problem for me, because ever since I was five our family had a large garden of over an acre and it was very productive. I had never had an issue with things not growing. We had good river bottom land and we were able to obtain very large quantities of organic substances to mix into it.\nThe fact that I had two plantings die on me was just the kind of mystery that I needed to perk up my mind a little.\nAbout this time the first Whole Earth Catalog was making its rounds and I noticed this little section on Hydroponics. Names and addresses for additional information was included so I sent several letters asking for information and headed off to the library. I found several good books on the subject and proceeded to acquire the needed materials to grow some plants hydroponically. I decided that the tomato plant would be best suited for my studies. I started some seeds and headed off to a chemical supply company to see if I could obtain some small quantities of pure, water soluble salts. We rummaged through some dusty old shelves in back and soon I had amassed the salts listed in a government pamphlet that had arrived in the mail. It didn't take long until I had an impressive tomato garden growing in my window.\nOne day, Gillian, our resident six year old, was playing in the back yard when a rather large Black Labrador wandered into the yard. Somehow, Gillian managed to grasp the dog's collar and he backed out of it. Upon inspecting the collar, I discovered the name, Smokey, and a phone number. I called the number and gave our address.\nLater that evening, an elderly gentleman, Paul Ottmann, knocked on our back door. He thanked us for returning the collar and then noticed the tomato plants growing in the window. He lit up with a big smile and said, \"Did you know that there is a hydroponic green house just a couple of blocks West of here?\" I responded that I hadn't lived in the area long and had no knowledge of it. He gave me the address of his shop and told me to stop by some evening and he would show it to me. I promised to accept his invitation and bid him good night.\nA few days later I stopped by his \"shop\" and discovered that it was an incredible multi\u0096million dollar metal working facility. All around intermixed with incredible machine tools were racing cars and various industrial machines that were being designed and fabricated. He greeted me and after a few moments of chat he reached for a set of keys on a shelf and we headed off out the back door, down the rail road tracks, and into the back door of another building a couple of hundred yards away. And there in the basement of this factory, full of machines that Paul had created, was this wonderful hydroponic research garden .\nA few days later I received a surprise visit from Paul and the plant manager from Nitragin Sales, the company that we had visited. They had come to see my hydroponic tomatoes.\nThe next day, I receive a phone call from Paul asking if I could respond promptly to a problem over at Nitragen. They had just called him regarding one of the machines that he had built and he had determined that the problem was electrical. Since that was my specially he thought that I should run over. It took me about fifteen minutes to resolve the problem and I didn't even want to bill them for the call. I used the opportunity to learn more about the operation of the plant and the uses of its products.\nIn the following weeks, I received more calls from Nitragin. Mostly just little things that only took me a few minutes to fix. These little visits allowed me to become friends with a number of the people there and I slowly made my way into the laboratory where the research was being done.\nThe company was started in 1896 and was the first to commercially grow and sell nitrogen fixing bacteria. The relationship between plant and bacteria is very specific so, research is constantly being performed to find the best bacteria for each new hi-bred. A hydroponic solution is prepared that is lacking in nitrogen and the effects of each bacteria strain is determined through chemical analysis.\nThe people at Nitragin freely shared information with me, about lighting, chemistry , and the problems encountered when one endeavors to take an idea from the lab and make it work in the field. I learned how to better adjust the trace elements in my hydroculture formula and what to watch for when adding elements to an organic soil garden.\nThen I decided to scale up my own research project. My mother's brother had a sheet metal shop, so I bent myself a little 6 X 6 tray shape, 10 feet long, out of sheet metal and then took it to my brother's Canoe factory and fabricated 10 \u0096 20 foot sections of fiberglass tray. I went over to Paul's \"shop\" and welded up some simple \"H\" stands, sandblasted them, primed them and painted them black. I had the good fortune to be able to buy a small \"close out inventory\" of drip irrigation thingies. And with all this, together with a recycled water tank and a couple of recycled wash machines, I was able to create a nifty little hydroculture operation.\nAs I intensified my study into hydroponics, I uncovered other elements that were discovered by researchers but not listed in the government pamphlet. As each new atom was verified, I would rush off to my chemical supplier. Soon I had accounted for 18 atoms involved in this planetary life cycle. Shortly though, the pattern of new discoveries plateau. Most of the agricultural community had for the most part concluded that there were eighteen atoms needed for healthy plants. If anyone of these atoms is missing, there are noticeable physical changes, some quite dramatic, in the growth and appearance of the plants. There were a couple of other atoms that some researchers called growth promoters, but non-essential, like selenium for instance. We know today, that none of us could move a single muscle without selenium, since it is part of an enzyme that makes ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), the equivalent of gasoline for our body's cells.\nA nagging question occurred to me. Could healthy humans possibly require more than 18 elements? More than 64 different atoms have been found in plants, basically, some of everything in the growth medium. However, just because an atom is present, doesn't mean that the atom is serving a useful purpose. In fact, some atoms like aluminum , have a very negative effect on the growth process.\nI set up an experiment as a general test to determine if more than 18 atoms were needed. My experiments to date had used sand or gravel as a rooting medium for the plants. It was very possible that the plants could be extracting elements from their rooting medium. So, I set up two plastic pots, one filled with sand and the other with vermiculite and used a dilute hydroculture solution instead of water for my little test plants. It didn't take long to notice a rather large difference in the size and general appearance of the plants. It was most obvious that the plants were indeed extracting some very beneficial nutrients from the sand medium.\nIt was clear that the next stage of the experiment was going to take a bit of work. The workings of cells would need to be unfolded. An understanding of chemical processes on the level of proteins, enzymes and amino acids was clearly indicated. Each part of the human body would need to mapped out in terms of its atomic structure. The needs and speeds of the various enzymatic systems would need to be calculated and the hydroculture solution rebalanced each time a new atom was added.\nIn the last twenty years, I have added 11 additional atoms to the list of elements required for a healthy life cycle and I suspect that there are a few more yet to be documented. As we develop test equipment with ever greater sensitivity, I'm confident that we will acquire additional understanding of the subtlety of the life processes found on this planet.\nAbout this time, I encountered some incredible photographs of the earth taken from the surface of the moon. From that vantage point, it was possible to photograph the \"electrostatic aura\" around our planet that is created by the action of sunlight passing through the atmosphere. The dramatic change from day to night once again aroused my curiosity. Could this dynamic, cyclic change in electrical energy affect the growth of plants? I had come across a curious reference in one book I had found at the library. The researcher noted that, \"for what ever reason, plants seem to grow better in metal containers, than wooden ones.\"\nThe possibility that the difference in growth could be due to electrical effects crossed my mind.\nI designed an experiment that I felt would high\u0096light the negative. I took two identical potted plants and put them in a stable environment. One was placed on an iron plate and a wire screen about 2 square feet, was placed about six inches above the top of the pot. A power source outputting a short, sixty per second, 800 volt pulse was connected across the iron plate and wire screen. The idea was to block the normal, natural effects of the earth's electrostatic field. The results were dramatic ! The plants in the artificial field were severely stunted. There could be no doubt that there was an electrical effect involved in the growth of plants.\nIn the Secret Lives of Plants, I read of an experiment where two identical plants were placed inside two wooden boxes located in a basement. A metal plate of several square feet was mounted on the roof of the building. Another metal plate was fastened to the top, of one of the wooden boxes. An insulated wire (underground electric fence wire works) connected the two plates. The plant inside the box with the plate remained green while the other plant turned yellow and died. This experiment too, suggests that the earth's electrostatic field plays a role in the growth of plants.\nAll this was very interesting, but, I was facing a more pressing problem. The chemistry I was using was very expensive, I needed to develop a system to recover my mineral salts. Super pure salts are needed to do the research work because none of the test equipment available was sensitive enough to measure parts per billion, when there is a large grouping of different atoms. Very pure water and very pure salts were needed to consistently produce the exacting mixtures that are necessary for hydroponic research. Fortunately, it doesn't take high tech devices to re\u0096 use the ex\u0096hydroponic salts to grow food for the table. Mother Nature's finest, the organic garden is the perfect choice. At least that's what I started out thinking.\nFirst, I recycled a pair of large wash machine tubs to recycle my hydroponic organics. Next, I readied an old aquarium with it's heater. I took two gallon bottles and filled them with a mixture of horse manure and water. I took a gallon pickle jar, filled it with water and inverted it in the aquarium. This was to be used to collect the methane gas that would be given off by the bacterial action. I plumbed the bottles into the jar and ran an outlet line to a Bunsen burner. In a couple of days I had burnable gas being produced by the project.\nAbout this time, my home town, Winona Minn. installed a new waste water treatment plant for the city. My brother's Fiberglass company was contracted to do some on site work, so, one day I coaxed him to give me a little close\u0096up look-see tour. I checked all the plumbing and took note of the basic operating setup. I also obtained a sample of the anaerobic digester's solid output. It was gray and powdery, heavily loaded with Hot Lime (Calcium Carbonate).\nI heard that Racine Wisconsin also had a modern waste water treatment plant that used anaerobic Digesters. I call them up and they said \"sure come on down ...\". So, I and two friends set off on an adventure that to many would have seemed \"Weird\" at least.\nThe Racine water treatment plant was an ambitious one for the time. The plant was engineered to be powered from the natural gas being produced in the anaerobic Digesters. The gas was burned in internal combustion engines and the power used to compress air for use in a series of large aerobic Digesters used to process suspended organics that didn't filter out in the settling tanks. The waste heat from the engines was used to heat the anaerobic Digesters and the building. There was only one problem there wasn't enough organics in the waste water. The city pass an ordinance requiring all new homes to be equipped with garbage disposals, but even that hasn't brought in enough organic matter to power the plant. We received a very detailed tour of the facility. I felt quite qualified to run the place by the time we left. Every switch and valve was carefully explained. It was a most complete tour.\nI decided to play with some numbers. I calculated that the average suburban home could efficiently and handsomely be powered by 60,000 BTUs of energy an hour. Converting that into pounds of grass and compost, I came up with 20 pounds an hour. That's 480 pounds a day. Plants may be good solar collectors, but that is a mighty big lawn. It became clear that a single home system didn't make sense.\nThere was another serious issue with what was being removed from the bottom of the anaerobic Digesters. The material was a fine powder, and wasn't very easy to work with. The usual method of broadcasting the material on the field would result in one very large cloud of dust and if a strong wind was to come along before a soaking rain much of the material would be carried off by the wind. Some process is required to make the material more workable.\nAbout this time my home town, Winona, Minn., decided to undertake an interesting project. At one time Winona was for all practical purposes, an island in the Mississippi River. Over the years in the process of dredging the main navigation channel, the southern \"back water\" channel had been isolated from the river. As a result a shallow lake was formed that acted as a settling pond for a water shed that extended up away from the river. A number of species of fish would come in from the river and use the lake or its water shed creek for spawning. One of the species was Carp, a bottom feeding fish. As a result, the silty bottom of the lake was constantly being stirred up producing dark muddy water. This not only made the lake less than desirable for swimming, but also prevented light from penetrating to any considerable depth. The result was the lake was very low in oxygen especially when the water warmed in the summer. This caused fish to die off and a state of purification. In other words the lake stank!\nVarious schemes had been tried in the past, dredging the lake to make it deeper and sweep netting of the carp. The results were short lived and had a serious side effect. Now that light was able to penetrate to a deeper depth and aided by fertilizer run\u0096off from farms, the lake became a huge mass of weeds and algae. With new Carp coming in from the river things really got bad. The lake was turning into a swamp.\nIt became obvious that for the lake to become a asset for the city a complete echo management program was needed. A community was formed and working with one of the collages, a strategy was created. An underwater electric fence was placed at the outlet of the lake to prevent fish from going back and forth between the river and the lake. Then a poison was used to kill the fish and parasites. Three large aerators were installed in the lake to help maintain the oxygen level. Because the lake was very shallow, this was particularly important in the winter when the lake froze. This technique produced areas of open water where the fish could sun themselves as well as maintaining the oxygen level. \"Soil conservation\" measures were implemented on the water shed to reduce the influx of silt and fertilizers. Then the lake was stocked with several species of desirable fish and fishing peers were set up for fishermen.\nLastly, there was the issue of the weeds that always will grow in a shallow healthy lake. The weeds needed to be harvested and disposed of in some way. Since, in essence, the weeds were solar collectors and were removing minerals from the water and silt, the idea that they could be used as a commercial resource, seemed a reasonable possibility.\nI set up an experiment in a 21 liter bottle using a culture of lake weeds. Once again in a few days I was producing good quantities of high grade methane gas. Everything was working nicely until I had a moment of creative madness. I had some leftover pea soup and I wondered what effect it would have on methane production. Here let me say, at this point, my experiment was in my basement.\nI had read about some \"foaming problems\" that several experimenters had encountered, But !, ... Well, I had foam all over the place. All my pipes, my gas accumulator, everything was loaded with foam, and the smell ...? Well, this was a good demonstration of what can happen in a small unit. The culture medium is very easily upset by any change that is too rapid or the introduction of even the smallest amount of oxygen.\nAdditional testing of lake weeds and a combination of leaves and grass clippings proved to be most successful. The resultant after the digestion cycle was complete proved to be of excellent quality for use as a soil enhancement since the fiber content was still in tact. The quality was such that I suspect that it would make an excellent material to use to make \"Grow Blocks\" or \"Peat Pots\". Such items are an effective way of adding fiber to the soil near the top where it is most effective for retaining moisture and channels for oxygen to penetrate the soil.\nI determined that there was sufficient excess capacity in Winona's anaerobic Digesters to accommodate the weed harvest from the lake and with the addition of the weed fiber, the output from the Digesters would then be of commercial quality. I also found a nearby industry that was willing to buy the surplus methane. The next step was to set up for selling the fertilizer. For that an analyses of the content was needed. Although the material was rich in many factors that make up a good organic fertilizer, it was also rich in heavy metals, lead and cadmium in particular and dioxins, plus PBCs. This meant simply, that instead of having a saleable product that could offset the cost of operating the waste water treatment plant, we had instead a large quantity of hazardous waste that would require additional tax money to dispose of properly and legally. This is a perfect example of how a few can ruin something wonderful for the many. The problem isn't the lake weeds, they are being hauled away by several farmers, the contamination is coming from the water system pipes and various commercial establishments.\nThe time had come to use my hydroponic compost. I decided to set up a test plot to see if I would get better results from this compost than I did from my standard compost of leaves and grass, or from a section of garden where I had mixed in three pickup loads of peat that I had obtained from Nitragen's peat mine in Waukesha. I should have better anticipated the actual results but what occurred was a surprise to me.\nWhen I first started developing my hydroponic formula, I had used a dry leaf analyses of a corn plant, which was the only plant that I had encountered at the time, that was close to a tomato plant. Then over the coarse of several years, I slowly fined tuned the different salts to produce the type of plant and fruit that I wanted. Early efforts had produced a series of plants that were showing signs of deficiency. I was startled to see the same deficiencies in the plants that were growing in the hydroponic compost. This pointed out to me the major drawback of organic gardens. One needs to start out with the perfect balance of nutrients in the soil and then you have to return the elements you have removed in the form of your biological waste products. Otherwise, you need to know exactly what was removed in terms of its elemental make-up and then apply a biologically compatible soil enhancement.\nAt one point I decided to set up a organic greenhouse experiment. The structure was approximately 15 X 24 feet with insulated panels extending four feet into the ground. Fifty feet of \u00be inch plastic pipe was snaked across the bottom of the unit before the organic medium was introduced. Also, since I knew oxygen was needed for healthy root growth, I laid in several perforated lines hooked into a manifold. The snake was hooked to a water coil near the top of the green house through a small circulating pump and a fan was installed on the coil. The system was controlled by a thermostat. Experiments have shown that within limits, plants grow better when their roots are warmer than their shoots. The results were impressive. My tomato plants reached a length of over twenty five feet. However, the most impressive aspect of the experiment was the results gained from my ability to introduce air more than one meter below the surface. Plants display visual symptoms regarding the state of their health which is a reflection of their ability to extract the minerals they need from the growth medium. Since plants only can absorb inorganic ions, in an organic garden, they are totally dependent of the activity of bacteria and other organisms in the medium. After the plants had been growing for a couple of weeks, I noticed a yellowing of the growing tips. This indicated that the plants were experiencing difficulties obtaining needed ions. At this point, I connected the perforated manifold to the exhaust port of a vacuum cleaner and operated it for about twenty minutes. The next morning when I checked the plants, they were all dark green. Just that fast, overnight, a major change had taken place. This project clearly demonstrated the importance of having a well aerated growth medium.\nHydroponics has progressed since the 1930's. Commercial green houses can handle 1100 plants in a space only 26 X 126 feet. With only the most basic consideration of the plant's environmental needs, marketable tomatoes are produced only 90 days after the seedlings are transplanted. An inexpensive operation like his one can produce over 80,000 pounds of tomatoes a year. Hydroponic's versatility allows one to fine tune the growth medium to the specific needs of the plant of your choice.\nThere is little doubt in my mind that a properly managed organic garden has the best overall advantages. However, what ever system is used, the science of growth remains the same. Plants only absorb inorganic ions and they have optimum temperature cycles for roots and shoots. They also require both oxygen and carbon dioxide in the proper amounts both for proper leaf growth as well as for proper root growth. Studies have discovered that plant roots will only penetrate the rooting medium as deeply as the soil can breath. The root zone must be supplied with oxygen for both proper root growth and the micro-organisms that provide the water soluble elements for the plants to feed on.\nAs the biological processes developed on this planet, they removed carbon from our primitive atmosphere and released oxygen. The early earth atmosphere had virtually no molecular oxygen in it. When the organisms died, the carbon compounds that they contained remained in solid form to form first, organic soil, then peat and later coal and oil. As the result, the atmosphere gradually accumulated enough molecular oxygen to support animal life. The oxygen not only provided the basis for aerobic life processes, but also, as anyone who works with spectrometers knows, molecular oxygen (O2) absorbs ultraviolet radiation in the 179\u0096182 nanometers region. Without this filtering effect of oxygen and also water vapor, the sun's powerful ultraviolet wavelengths would break apart the chemical bonds that make biological life and much of our chemical technology possible. Since life processes operate in very narrow ranges, it should make perfect sense that digging up all the world's deposits of coal and oil and burning them will quickly bring about unwanted effects. Happily, with today's technology, there are ways of achieving our desired purposes without burning the resources. In today's view, coal and oil are worth more as feed stock for new advanced materials, making it seem crazy to burn them as energy fuels.\nBack in the early sixties, while I was studying engineering in collage, I worked for an advanced material company as an electrician. Among the special materials that we manufactured was what is now called graphite fiber which we sold to the government for $800.00 a pound back when gold was selling for $560.00. We also made the material for re\u0096entry heat shields for missiles, the material for space suits, plus many different materials for advanced electronic devices. Today, that super strong graphite fiber can be obtained for about $20.00 a pound and is used for many different products.\nToday's standards make those materials seem primitive by comparison. In Albuquerque New Mexico, the National Science Foundation, Sandia National Lab, Los Almos National Lab and the University of New Mexico, working with private companies have set up a special facility for developing new materials. I had the opportunity to do some research there in the early 90's when they first began operations. Advanced ceramics, special thin films, memory metals, new insulators, and more are being perfected. Crystalline ceramic fibers which are much stronger than the graphite fiber and able to withstand temperatures above 1600 degrees centigrade have been perfected. Made from natural gas and sand this type of material can be used to replace resources that are becoming scarce. We also grew new forms of Cadmium fibers that promise to improve battery technology.\nElsewhere, a new thin film solar cell is being developed that is 80% efficient. A one horse power motor will soon be operated from a solar collector of only one square meter.\nI have worked on a new method of purifying water that is remarkably simple and super efficient. I have developed microwave technology for the casting industry that reduces air pollution from the process by 95% and uses only 10% of the energy of the old process. We have new technology for removing exhaust emissions, new materials for light bulb filaments and cutting tools. New lubricants are being created, diamond fiber promises to produce tires that will last the life of your car, reducing the problem of disposing of the old tires. A new improved method for recycling tires and the like into fuel oil and boiler gas has recently been scaled up and is under going pre-production testing.\nThe seeds of a new technological future are being readied by talented and innovative people. However, seeds need to be planted and cared for lovingly. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent by our tax payers on sophisticated research is being handed over to other nations because no one in this country wants to setup factories in the U.S. to produce the new products. We paid for the knowledge, but we will benefit little from it, unless attitudes change. A new source of energy will become available soon and the future is looking for young minds that are good at putting scientific puzzles together. However, young minds need support, tools, financing and encouragement if society is to benefit from their talents.\nEngineering today is the art of creating shapes with composites. Most of the restrictions of the past have been overcome through the properties of our new generation of building materials. Our new homes can be hurricane poof and tornado resistant. Shape is no real limitation. Living spaces can be constructed to fully enhance health and creativity.\nBy taking an overview of all the research that has been performed in this country, we can gain an understanding of the biological world of which we are a part. This knowledge can allow us to tune our environment to enhance our surroundings to benefit both us and the other life forms that occupy our domain.\nOne of the most important aspects of our environment that we can control is lighting. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that not only plants, but apparently all animals including humans have biological cycles that are controlled by light. Perhaps the most surprising aspects of the studies is the fact that certain colors and intensities are needed to control these biological rhythms. Plants need specific frequencies of red and blue to perform photosynthesis and are greatly inhibited by ultraviolet. A single pain of window glass used as an ultraviolet filter has been shown to greatly increase the growth rate of many plants. Plants can be prevented from going to seed for years by keeping them in a constant artificial light environment. Some plants, during the early stages of their growth cycle, can be kept in constant light. Others, especially during the later reproductive part of their cycle must have a dark cycle.\nBears and humans, among others, will go into a hibernation cycle if there is insufficient blue light of a minimum intensity. Some people are more strongly affected for some reason than others. These people are said to be affected by what is called the SAD syndrome ( Seasonally Affected Disorder ) , but I prefer to call it the \"Tendency To Hibernate\" ( TTH ). We all have this mechanism in our Pituitary that produces a hormone, Melatonin, in the absence of bright blue light. This hormone is involved in the healing process and also is responsible for regulating our metabolism, and our awake and sleep cycles. If an excess quality of this hormone builds up in our system, our mental and physical processes slow down and we have a tendency to sleep a lot. Personally I find the experience analogous to having my mind perform like a \"Cray Computer\" in the summer and an old style \"Turbo XT PC\" in the winter. The solution is to supply bright blue-green light of the type produced by daylight or Full Spectrum Bulbs. The timing of when the light is needed, varies from person to person and varies with intensity. The results produced for myself and others are nothing short of a miracle. \"In my book\", a hour of light has more worth than a pot of coffee.\nPlant growth too can be accelerated by extending the hours of lighting. Plants too, need special colors of light to perform their role of releasing oxygen. They need a narrow band of red and a narrow band of blue. Current research is focusing on tuning bulbs and emitters to emit light strongly at desired frequencies and not at others. This means that we are creating lighting equipment that is much more efficient at doing the job at hand. The Fun, the convenience, the health benefits of having a few large plants in a small convenient location is exciting.\nThe importance of light was known to me before I left for New Mexico. Also, I had developed an interest in growing exotic crystals in the late sixties. So when I heard about a retired Los Almos researcher, Dr. John V. Milewski , who was growing crystal fibers for use as a light bulb filament, I set out to meet him.\n"}, {"score": 411.78357, "uuid": "2b6b291e-5e9f-5979-8a90-be6e2639db1d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300wb-83-25721", "target_hostname": "www.theecophile.com", "target_uri": "http://www.theecophile.com/tag/15cm/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.1702936e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "15cm &raquo; 2/3 &raquo; the ecophile", "snippet": "study <em>in</em> (96 unlined page) * Thick and supple bison leather complete with necktie fastener Lokta ecological card <em>is</em> a C% sustainable assets as it <em>is</em> made from the cinnamon <em>of</em> a works <em>which</em> grows degree <em>in</em> the Himalayas.", "explanation": null, "document": "Large leather diary is hundred% Handmade at every stage!\nLokta covered strawboard Box and palpebra ~ also handmade throughout\nLokta paper is a hundred% Sustainable assets\nLovely ecological card to write or study in (96 unlined page)\nThick and supple bison leather complete with necktie fastener\nLokta ecological card is a C% sustainable assets as it is made from the cinnamon of a works which grows degree in the Himalayas.

Consider, if you will, the present moment as a topologist would: it is, simply put, `a point' in time, which is infinitely near to `the set of all points' in the past, and infinitely near, without the slightest gap, to `the set of all points' in the future. A topologist can represent, with mathematical rigour, the essence of the present moment. He has only to recall the topological structure of `the real line.' \"\nIt seemed ironic that, even as he was speaking of the infinite nearness of points in time, the eminent Russian mathematician should be running 15 minutes late for the seminar he teaches at six o'clock on Monday evenings. An hour earlier, he had been standing at the door of his apartment, changing out of his slippers and into his oxfords, when the telephone had rung. An old friend was on the line, and Alexander Vladimirovich had sat down on a rickety wooden chair in the entrance hall for a chat. He might have cut the conversation short had he known that he would have to wait longer than usual for the Lomonosovskii-Prospekt bus.\n\"Don't worry,\" he said now, as we hurried across the verdant top of Lenin Hill. \"My students expect me to be at least fifteen minutes late.\" Approaching the university's soaring central tower, we passed a paved, hedged-in courtyard and joined a crush of students entering the building, one by one, through a swinging glass door. We filed quickly by three uniformed guards, then jostled our way through a grand, marble-clad lobby to take the elevator.\nM.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University opened in 1755, upon the issue of an edict by Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, daughter of Peter the Great. Its official title bears the name of its founder, Mikhail Vasilevich Lomonosov: a scientist, historian, linguist, and poet who, in Russia, possesses the stature of Leonardo da Vinci. Originally housed in a building in Red Square, M.S.U. is now one of the largest higher-educational institutes in the former U.S.S.R., employing roughly 3,500 instructors and 4,000 researchers, and with an enrollment of more than 32,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Dominating the city's skyline south-west of the Kremlin, its principal modern edifice rises 32 storeys, the tip of its red-starred spire reaching a height of 994 feet. The central tower is flanked on both sides by 18-storey wings, each of which in turn branches off into two 12-storey wings. The labyrinthine structure comprises a total of 45,000 rooms: students of mathematics like to tell you that to spend just a minute in each would take 37 days and require walking 90 miles.\nThe Chair of General Topology and Geometry is located in Room 1222 on the 12th floor, the first of four floors occupied by the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics. Its heavy door opens into a narrow chamber whose furnishings are sparse, worn with age, and \"low-tech\": a long wooden table and, at right angles to it, a big square desk with the secretary's manual typewriter resting on its top. A chess set and two timers sit permanently at one end of the room: members of the Chair drop by, on occasion, for a couple of matches of \"Blitz.\"\nA large, finely wrought portrait hangs in the centre of the north wall. It depicts an old man with a completely bald head and round, black spectacles. Seated calmly behind an ancient desk, he leans on his elbows, palms facing each other, fingertips lightly touching. His eyebrows are slightly raised, as if he were listening to a student explain a difficult mathematical proof. \"That's Pavel Sergeevich,\" said Arhangel'skii, nodding to the portrait. He was referring to his mentor, P.S. Alexandroff: one of the greatest figures in Russia's mathematical history and one of the world's foremost pioneers of that branch of modern mathematics known as topology.\nSurrounding the painting are a number of quick, gestural pencil sketches; most of these also portray Alexandroff, caught in the act of lecturing. One drawing, however, is of someone else: a man in his late 20s, perhaps, viewed in profile and slightly from behind, seated at a small desk, hunched in concentration over some papers. The sketch accentuates the subject's long, wavy mane of hair and the massive bulk of his shoulders. There is something vaguely Grecian in his profile, which reveals thin lips, a straight nose, and a slightly hooded eye. I did not need my host to tell me who was depicted in this sketch; for although it was made in his youth, it was still a good likeness. Alexander Vladimirovich has evidently changed little over the past 25 years. A few wrinkles have etched themselves about his hooded eyes, which, in real life, flash a wintry blue. His hair, once strawberry blond, has thinned slightly and turned snow white, and he now keeps it closely cropped. He has put little excess weight on his athletic, six-foot-tall frame.\nWhen the drawing was made, in 1966 (more than 10 years after its subject had enrolled as an undergraduate student of mathematics at Moscow State University and had decided to concentrate his thinking in the field of topology, under Alexandroff's tutelage), Arhangel'skii had already won substantial recognition for introducing the concept of \"a network,\" which has since become fundamental to the study of the field. (He devised it in 1959, as part of the thesis he wrote in order to receive his diplom: an undergraduate degree awarded after five years of study, which is, however, more akin to an American master's than a bachelor's degree). Already, too, he had been accepted as an aspirant (graduate student) at Moscow State University and had been awarded his kandidat nauk (candidate of sciences degree, equivalent to an American Ph.D.). He had also been granted the position of docent (associate professor) at the Chair of Higher Geometry and Topology. It was in 1966, at the unusually young age of 28, that he was awarded his doktor nauk (doctor of sciences degree, which is of higher rank than an American Ph.D., and for which there is no American equivalent); he was correspondingly granted the title of professor. Three years later, Arhangel'skii proved that you cannot construct \"a compact, first-countable, topological space\" whose size, or \"cardinality,\" is greater than that of ``the real line.\" In doing so, he solved a fundamental question, regarding the possible size of such a topological space, that had been posed by Alexandroff in 1922. He thus dramatically strengthened his reputation and launched a new area of interest for general topologists to do with \"cardinal functions.\"\nI first met A.V. Arhangel'skii in August 1987, at York University in Toronto. He had been invited there to speak at a conference on set theory and its applications, an event attended by 80 mathematicians from 12 countries. The organizers were particularly pleased by Arangel'skii's presence: it was the first time in 22 years that he had been permitted to leave the Soviet Union to visit North America. Our meeting was fortuitous: I am not a mathematician, but rather the wife of one (which is, at times, an art unto itself), and thus had no reason to attend the mathematical lectures. But because my husband, topologist Stephen Watson, was one of the organizers of the conference, Arhangel'skii was one of many renowned set theorists and topologists whom I had the opportunity to meet socially.\nIt was at a small dinner party held in an elegant Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto that I first spoke to Arhangel'skii. The party had been organized by Frank Tall, a sociable professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto, who relishes Oriental food. (Besides being a noted topologist and an editor of the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, he is a practitioner of a kind of psychotherapy from California called \"neurolinguistic programming\" -- which he says involves \"the study of the structure of subjective experience.\") Tall had invited an illustrious group of mathematicians to dine that evening. Seated about the round table with him, Arhangel'skii, and my husband were American set theorist Lee Stanley; Dutch topologist Jan van Mill, who, among other things, has a special interest in \"ultrafilters\"; and Mary Ellen Rudin, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who is universally respected by her peers as North America's greatest living set-theoretic topologist.\nSeated beside Arhangel'skii, I noticed that he was neatly attired in a jacket, dress shirt, and tie. (While there are exceptions to the rule, mathematicians are not generally known for their sartorial flair.) He proved to be an interesting and charming conversationalist whose manner, when speaking to women, could at times be construed as mildly flirtatious. His English was surprisingly fluent and colloquial: he explained that in the 1970s he had spent several years working at the University of Islamabad, in Pakistan, where he had habitually spoken English. An accomplished linguist, he also speaks some French, Italian, and Spanish, and is an avid reader of foreign literature. In the course of the evening, he conversed thoughtfully and eloquently not only about mathematics but also about politics, classical music, literature, and art. I detected in the manner of his speech an unhurried politeness that I couldn't help but associate with a past age. I felt, too, that the list of purchases he hoped to make while visiting Toronto -- teas, coffees, tobacco, and parfum -- could have been stolen from the moneybag of a 19th-century gentleman traveller.\nI was most intrigued by his questions about Canada and Canadians. He wanted to know which native poets Canadians were currently reading; what issues concerned them; in what styles did they write. Who were the local artists currently in fashion? Where could he go to view some recent Canadian art? His mother, he told me in passing, was a painter. I was also intrigued by a brief exchange on mathematics that passed between him and my husband. He wanted to know not only which problems Stephen was in the process of trying to solve but why Stephen had chosen to work on those particular ones. It seemed to me that Arhangel'skii was, at least on the surface, more overtly philosophical than the North American and European mathematicians that I had previously encountered. He seemed to be more the scion of that long line of venerated mathematicians, from the time of the ancient Greeks up until the 20th century, who had also been philosophers. I began to wonder whether he would be able, willing, or even perhaps keen to convey to a general audience some of the central notions, intellectual rigour, and beauty inherent in his chosen field.\nI found, too, that Arhangel'skii, like many mathematicians, was not without a sense of humour and competitive spirit. At one point during the evening, he mentioned to Dutch topologist Jan van Mill that, while living in Pakistan, he had acquired a taste for very hot curries. Van Mill countered that he too liked very spicy food and often dined in Indonesian restaurants. Overhearing their conversation, Frank Tall called over our waiter and whispered something in his ear. With a quick nod, the waiter scurried off to the kitchen, returning several moments later with two large bowls brimming with small, shiny, deep red peppers, each of them curled like half moons. \"These are the chef's hottest Thai peppers,\" he said.\nTall bade the waiter to set down one bowl in front of Arhangel'skii and the other in front of van Mill. He then asked if the two mathematicians would care to partake in a hot-pepper-eating competition: he who finished his bowl first would be declared winner. Rising to the challenge, Arhangel'skii and van Mill turned to look one another squarely in the face, as Tall counted down: \"On your mark. . . . Get set. . . . Go!\" As the men devoured the peppers, their faces turned pale, then several shades of red. At last, with both bowls almost empty and sweat pouring from both men's brows, van Mill conceded defeat. Arhangel'skii, unable to resist a dramatic flourish, popped one last pepper into his mouth.\nFrank Tall once conveyed to me a piece of conventional wisdom regarding the evaluation of a given work of mathematics by mathematicians. A mathematical work, he held, could be judged fairly on the basis of its depth and its breadth -- both of which criteria could be applied to either a discussion of a single theorem or the accumulated achievements of a lifetime. The terms require some explanation. When speaking about the \"depth\" of a piece of mathematics, mathematicians are, to some extent, making reference to how far that piece penetrates to the essence of a known problem -- an essence that may be hidden to all but the finest of minds. They may also be making reference to how far it ventures from known territory into uncharted realms. The term deep, therefore, can be used by mathematicians to describe a mathematical result that is deemed original, and thus most likely difficult. It is, however, quite possible for mathematicians to debate about the level of originality and difficulty inherent in a given result even when the veracity of that result is beyond any doubt. Breadth, on the other hand, is used to say something about the range of mathematical ideas present in a given discovery, or the range of ideas to which it naturally connects. (Note that neither the depth nor the breadth of a mathematical work -- and here I am referring only to a work of pure mathematics, such as topology, which is pursued for its own sake, as opposed to applied mathematics, which is pursued for the purposes of science -- is related in any way to its potential or realized practical applications.)\nNot surprisingly, the work of most great mathematicians exhibits both breadth and depth -- and this is certainly true of Arhangel'skii's. Over the past three decades, his mathematical discoveries have reflected a broad range of topological concerns, as well as those that stand outside the domain's traditional bounds. Influenced, no doubt, by the struggles of his teacher, Alexandroff, to unify the field, he has shown interest in such varying matters as \"cardinal functions,\" ``mappings,\" \"topological groups,\" and, most recently, ``function spaces.\" The breadth of his mathematical reflection has given him an overall perspective on topology that is rare. It has enabled him to pose problems of relevance and difficulty for other topologists to work on. In doing so, he has wielded considerable influence upon the way in which the field has developed, especially in the former Soviet Union.\nIt is also, perhaps, this breadth of knowledge that has helped him make his deepest mathematical discoveries. Certainly, the depth of Arhangel'skii's thinking has resulted from an idiosyncratic bent that is best described as philosophical. He has won for himself an eternal place in the history of topology, not so much through the resolution of difficult problems (though he has solved his fair share) but rather through the creation of concepts. These concepts -- such as that of a \"network,\" or the \"tightness\" of a topological space, or the presence of a ``free sequence\" within it -- have become fundamental to the ways in which topologists think about space.\n\"Mathematics is, for me, an investigation of the reality of thought,\" Arhangel'skii once said. \"It investigates the mind's thinking, perfects the thinking, creates new modes of thinking. For me, the truth that is revealed by mathematics is, above all, the truth about the working of the mind.\"\nThe word topology is derived from the Greek words topos and logos and means \"the science of place.\" Adapted from the French topologie, the word came into use in English in the 1600s. Its original meaning -- the branch of botany that deals with the localities of particular plants -- has fallen into disuse, along with a host of later ones. (In the 1860s, the word primarily referred to the art of assisting the memory by associating the thing to be remembered with some well-known place.) Topology was introduced as a mathematical term by the German mathematician Johann Benedict Listing, whose Vorstudien zur Topologie, published in 1847, was the first systematic treatise on the subject. The branch of mathematics known today as topology divides into two connected but separate divisions: \"algebraic\" topology and -- Arhangel'skii's area of expertise -- \"set- theoretic\" topology. Set-theoretic topology comprises a modern, abstract geometry that deals with the construction, classification, and description of the properties of \"topological spaces.\" Its development into a distinct mathematical realm was dependent upon the 19th-century creation of a geometry that was non-Euclidean and the subsequent re- evaluation of the relationship between geometry and the reality of the physical space.\nWhile the name geometry is derived from two Greek words -- ge, meaning \"earth\" or ``ground,\" and metrein, meaning ``to measure\" -- the science was invented, at some unknown date, by the ancient Egyptians. The architecture of the great pyramids, which were constructed between the 30th and 26th centuries B.C., indicates that their builders possessed some geometric knowledge. As its name suggests, geometry probably arose as a tool for the accurate surveying of land. The writings of Herodotus in the fifth century B.C. and Proclus in the fifth century A.D. recount that flooding of the Nile river made it difficult for royal surveyors, gathering information for the levying of taxes, to measure agricultural lands along its banks. The priests were thus called upon to invent a system of measurement to assist them. Ancient Egyptian surveyors were known as \"rope stretchers,\" because they used ropes in the taking of their measurements. There is considerable evidence that they were aware of some fundamental geometric theorems: it seems they knew, for example, that when three ropes of lengths three, four, and five units respectively are brought together to form a triangle, the particular triangle that is formed is a right-angled triangle.\nKnowledge of the rise of mathematics in Egypt, gleaned from Greek sources, was corroborated and supplemented by the information brought to light by the Rhind Papyrus: a scroll named after the young Scottish antiquary, A. Henry Rhind, who purchased it in Luxor in 1858. It was written around 1700 B.C. by a scribe named Aahmes and rather mysteriously entitled Directions for Knowing All Dark Things.\nThe science of geometry was developed further by the classical Greeks. From a variety of sources, scholars date the beginnings of Greek mathematics (and philosophy) at roughly 600 B.C. Both disciplines developed, simultaneously, in several successive centres where the civilization of the Greeks had established itself. At each centre, a group of scholars gathered about one or two influential leaders to form an informal or formal school. The first of these was founded by Thales (c.640 - c.546 B.C.) in the wealthy Mediterranean port city of Miletus, Ionia. The second school of Greek mathematical thought was founded by Pythagoras (who may have been a student of Thales) in Croton, southern Italy, in the sixth century B.C. The Pythagoreans are credited with having discovered many geometric theorems, concerning triangles, regular polyhedra, polygons, circles, spheres, etc.\nThe geometric discoveries of the Greeks were compiled and recorded by Euclid in the Elements. Unfortunately, all that is known of Euclid is that he lived and taught in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C. Unfortunately, too, no original manuscript of his famous treatise has survived; standard English versions, such as T.L. Heath's The Thirteen Books of Euclid's \"Elements\" (1908), are derived from Arab and Latin translations. Nevertheless, no other work has had greater influence than the Elements on mathematical and scientific thought. Sir Isaac Newton, for example, patterned his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica after it.\nIn setting down the Elements, Euclid employed, in its nascent form, the axiomatic method. Probably invented by the Pythagoreans, the axiomatic method manifests the Greeks' unparalleled recognition of the power of deductive reasoning to discover truth. It remains the means by which logicians of all stripes, be they mathematicians or philosophers, formulate their ideas. It consists of setting forth certain statements, which are believed but not demonstrated to be true, then inferring other statements from the first, in a logical chain. (Bertrand Russell argued that the axiomatic method was the essence of mathematics. In his 1929 essay \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\" he wrote, \"Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that, if such and such a proposition is true of anything, then such and such another proposition is true of that thing.\")\nEuclid had indubitably looked to Aristotle's writings for guidance on the mode of deductive reasoning. Aristotle had argued persuasively that \"every demonstrative science must start from indemonstrable principles; otherwise, the steps of demonstration would be endless.\" He had divided these indemonstrable principles into (a) axioms, which are common to all sciences, and (b) postulates, which are particular to a specific subject such as geometry. Euclid thus began the Elements with a set of postulates and axioms (which he called common notions), as well as a set of definitions. The first five of each of these three sets reads as follows:\nDefinitions\nA point is that which has no part.\nA line is breadthless length.\nThe extremities of a line are points.\nA straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\nA surface is that which has length and breadth only.\nPostulates\nIt is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any point.\nIt is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.\nIt is possible to describe a circle with any centre and distance.\nThat all right angles are equal to one another.\nThat if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.\nCommon Notions\nThings which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.\nIf equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.\nIf equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\nThings which coincide with one another are equal to one another.\nThe whole is greater than the part.\nBased upon his set of axioms and postulates, Euclid deduced the truth of further propositions, called theorems. Many of these concern the relationships between various distances and angles embodied in abstract, ideal figures. The most famous theorem among them, known as the Pythagorean theorem, states that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.\nFor more than 2,000 years, mathematicians held the truth of Euclidean geometry to be absolute and incontrovertible. The theorems put forward in the Elements were believed to be \"certain\" and ``necessary,\" because they were demonstrated to be true without appeal to empirical fact. (It is the deductive, as opposed to inductive, nature of mathematical thinking that inspires trust in the validity of mathematical discoveries and accounts for the historic acclaim of mathematics as \"the queen of sciences.\" The findings of all other sciences -- derived from testing the accuracy of reasoned hypotheses through careful experimentation and observation -- do not, and cannot, elicit the same faith. A scientific hypothesis can be regarded as the truth only within a high degree of probability, on the basis of available evidence. A scientist must accept that, no matter how many tests he conducts, any given hypothesis may have to be thrown out in the light of new evidence. A mathematician, however, can feel confident that once he has proven the truth of a given hypothesis, it will stand as proven, once and for all.) The geometric theorems of Euclid's Elements -- the truths of which were established without address to experiential evidence -- were imbued with that particular \"mathematical certainty,\" and, for this reason, esteemed.\nParadoxically, non-empirical Euclidean geometry was also believed to describe and reflect the properties of physical space. The roots of this self-contradictory posture are profound, bedded in the interlocking history of Greek philosophy and mathematics (in which the discovery of geometry plays a crucial part). Greek philosophic inquiry began in the seventh century B.C. with questions regarding the physical world. Filled with wonder, the first Greek philosophers (who were also the civilization's first mathematicians), Thales of Miletus and his pupils Anaximander and Anaximenes, asked themselves: What are things really like? How can we explain the process of change in things? How can we distinguish what things seem to be, from what they are, between their \"appearance\" and their ``reality\"? They put forth their replies in the belief that nature was patterned by a coherent design that could be apprehended by the reasoning mind. By the fifth century B.C., the Pythagoreans recognized that nature's design was mathematical, that mathematics -- the truths of which were discovered by means of deductive reasoning -- was therefore the key to unlocking her secrets. The importance of mathematics was thus linked, from one of its earliest inceptions, to its applicability in the search to comprehend the physical world. Furthermore, Euclidean geometry had its specific origins in the generalization and systematization of \"real-life\" discoveries made in connection with the practice of surveying, the physical measurement of areas and volumes, and the development of astronomy.\nIn the 18th century, Immanuel Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, contemplated the truths of Euclidean geometry and their relationship to physical space. Kant, whose major work is the Critique of Pure Reason (1781), held that the true task of philosophy was the critical appraisal of the capacities of human reason. Rejecting the arguments of the radical empiricist David Hume that all our knowledge consists of a series of impressions which we derive through our senses, he maintained, in a somewhat paradoxical fashion, that \"though our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it all arises out of experience.\" He called this knowledge, which arises out of our faculty of rational judgment, a priori; and, to provide an example of a priori knowledge, he offered up \"any proposition in mathematics.\" Kant then asked how is it possible that such a priori judgments, which do not arise out of experience, can apply to the external world of sense-perceptions, the world of science. His answer was revolutionary: a priori judgments of the mind do not conform to external reality; the mind, he argued, is so structured that it acts upon the world of sense-perceptions, imposing itself, controlling and organizing, so that the world of sense-perceptions conforms to the mind. Kant also maintained that the mind possesses, innately, what he called \"forms of intuition,\" through which the mind acts upon the objects of the world of sense-perceptions. Among these forms of intuition were space and time. Thus we inevitably perceive the objects of the world as existing in space and time. He argued, too, that the mind's \"form of space\" was Euclidean.\nDespite Kant's influential arguments, and in the face of age-old beliefs, mathematicians began to question the relationship between the truths of Euclidean geometry and the properties of physical space. Their doubts were raised, in the 19th century, by the founding of non-Euclidean geometry -- which is considered by historians to be the most consequential and revolutionary step in the development of mathematics since Greek times.\nDue west of the Kremlin, beyond the ring road that separates Moscow's inner and outer cities, the east-west Kalinina Prospekt bends slightly to the south, heading across the River Moskva, just where it snakes around the gargantuan Hotel Ukraine. Stretching away from the Kalinina Bridge, on the western bank of the river, the avenue continues, now called Kutuzovski Prospekt. It was given this name in 1957 in honour of Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov, who led the Russian forces against Napoleon in the War of 1812. Following the course of the ancient road to Smolensk, Kutuzovski Prospect veers gently toward a rise of land called the Poklonnaya Gora; the Russian name translates as \"the hill you bow to,\" recalling a custom once observed by travellers arriving in Moscow from this direction. It was on this height, which years ago commanded a view of the city, that Napoleon stood, waiting to receive official word of Moscow's surrender.\nThe building of Kutuzovski Prospekt began in the 1930s, entailing the destruction of smaller streets of old wooden houses, and was not completed until the early 1960s. Sixteen lanes wide, its scale is emblematic of the grand proportions (some might think monstrously grand) of modern Moscow, planned and constructed during Stalin's era. It is, to some extent, Moscow's Champs Elysees, imposing and attractive, lined on both sides by large apartment houses built in a neo-classical style. Mainly six to 12 storeys high, and stretching the length of a longer-than-average city block, they look like high-rises tipped on their sides. Their monolithic facades are broken up by large windows, balustrades, and decorative reliefs; stuccoed pastel shades of peach and gold, they grow more roseate when struck by the sun. Ground floors are occupied by shops, purveying bread, milk, fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, canned goods, and clothes. (They were, when I was in Moscow, well-stocked one day and near empty the next, depending upon the vicissitudes of an economic system in the process of change.) Babushkas, who have come into the city from nearby villages, sit out on the wide, tree-lined sidewalks, wearing flowered scarves and printed dresses. They totter on small stools before their baskets of tomatoes, cucumbers, and dill, on sale at black-market rates.\nAlexander Vladimirovich Arhangel'skii lives on Kutuzovski Prospekt with his wife, Olga Constantinovna, and their 27-year-old son, Vladimir Alexandrovich. (The Arhangel'skiis also have a 31-year-old daughter, Tatiana Alexanderovna; she is married and lives in Moscow with her husband and eight-year-old son.) Arhangel'skii enjoys its relative proximity to M.S.U. He also appreciates the fact that from the Kutuzovskaya Metro Station, near the western end of Kutuzovski Prospekt, it is only a two-stop subway ride to the Kievskaya Station. From there, he can board an Elektrishke, an electrical commuter train, and, in less than a half an hour, be walking (or, in winter, cross-country skiing) through a forest of birch. It is not much farther from the Kutuzovskaya station to the Kurski station, from where he can catch another train, and, in roughly an hour's time, arrive in the village of Saltykovskaya, where his mother resides.\n\"It is an important street,\" Alexander Vladimirovich told me as we drove down Kutuzovski Prospekt one time. Its historic name and associations obviously pleased him. His flat is situated on the top floor of a six-storeyed apartment house. Below average height and lacking balconies, it's slightly less grandiose than many of the other apartments on the street. Its distinguishing feature is a small grove of birch and poplar trees growing out front in a sandy patch of earth and shading its neo-classical facade. Alexander Vladimirovich likes these trees. He finds them not only beautiful but a source of pride. \"They are a sign that this is a special place,\" he said. \"In the old days, during festivals, people would hang lamps on their branches.\" He also pointed out that the only other apartment house on the street to be graced by such trees was that standing almost directly across from his own, which housed both Brezhnev and Andropov during their terms of power.\nDuring my two-week stay in Moscow, in July of 1991, Arhangel'skii and his family graciously allowed me to stay in their home, affording me an intimate view of their lives that was unexpected and delightful. Arhangel'skii was a charming, accommodating, thoughtful, and proud host. He went to some effort to meet my flight which, landed in the early evening at Sheremetyevo, Moscow's international airport. His car, a white 1980s Volga, had been in a state of disrepair for several months. (Spare parts, he later explained, were available only on the black market at prices he either couldn't afford or refused to pay.) So he convinced a colleague to make the 45-minute drive to the airport from the city centre. Standing in Sheremetyevo's dingy arrival hall, Arhangel'skii stood out, tall and erect, among a crowd of his compatriots. He looked dapper in a tweed cap, khaki-green Gore-Tex jacket, jeans, and walking shoes -- all of which he had purchased on a recent trip to Oxford, England. On his wrist flashed a Swatch watch. He greeted me with a broad smile and firm handshake, and introduced me to V.V. Tkachuk, a former pupil and professor at Moscow State University. He then politely insisted upon carrying my bags.\n\"I am sorry it is gray for your arrival,\" he fretted. ``It has been sunny and warm for two weeks straight. I hope this bad weather will not continue for too long.\" We left the airport, weaving in and out of traffic, on a rain-slicked eight-laned highway, along which stood shimmering birch trees, interrupted by the odd billboard advertising Goldstar Electronics. After several minutes, Arhangel'skii pointed out a gigantic monument built of World War II tank traps, saying it marked the spot where the German army was halted in its advance toward Moscow in October 1941. Having passed through the city's ever-sprawling suburbs of high-rise towers, we reached the ring road that encircles Moscow's centre. Arhangel'skii commented that officials had rechristened many streets, returning to them their pre-revolutionary names. \"Soon the tourist will require a map from the age of Czar Nicholas!\" he said.\nTo reach his flat, the visitor must first exit off Kutuzovski Prospect, through a square portal large enough to accommodate a car, and enter a courtyard. In the centre is a treed, fenced-in, sandy park, with benches, swings, and slides -- most of them in need of repair and a fresh coat of paint. (On fine days, people hang their laundry to dry on lines strung between the trees.) Leading off the courtyard, an entranceway opens into a small, damp, dark passage, lined with cracked white and red tiles, leading to a gloomy, circular stairwell and grilled elevator shaft. Arhangel'skii's apartment is on the sixth and final floor. The heavy, padded door is double locked: Muscovites have started to worry about break-ins.\nInside, Arhangel'skii's wife and son are waiting to greet us. Olga Constantinovna shyly shakes hands. She is a short, stout, no-nonsense, but kindly-looking woman with brown, grey-streaked hair, clipped boyishly short; a rounded, slightly Oriental face with gently slanted eyes; a flattened nose; and a gold-toothed smile. She calls her husband \"Shurie\" or \"Shurika,\" and speaks to him in a high-pitched, sing-song voice. She too pursued mathematics at Moscow State University and was awarded with a kandidat nauk. She teaches at an institute devoted to the training of high-school teachers. Arhangel'skii 's son, Vladimir Alexanderovich, or \"Volodya,\"as his father calls him, is a strapping, big-boned young man with dark brown hair parted in the middle, reaching past his shoulders. He is dressed all in black: a black T-shirt, black corduroy pants, a black bandanna across his forehead.\nOlga Constantinovna turns to her husband and speaks quietly with him in Russian for several moments. (While she is able to understand simple conversational English, she is not familiar enough with the language to speak it.) He explains that his wife had come home not long before our arrival and wishes to excuse herself to finish cooking dinner. She promptly disappears through a side door. Arhangel'skii then tells me to leave my bags for now in the entrance hall. He beckons me to change out of my shoes into slippers, which he provides from a pile just inside the front door, and he and his son lead me deeper into the apartment.\nInside, Arhangel'skii's apartment exudes a dusty, imperial charm, a faded glamour, romantic and sad. It is larger than the average Moscow flat (one room, plus kitchen and bathroom) that many families must remain content to live in. It has a lovely layout: four rooms -- a number of them serving several purposes -- plus a big kitchen and bathroom, lying off a central entrance hall. The rooms are graced by 15-foot moulded ceilings, the paint peeling in places; aged silken wallpapers; broad-stripped herringbone parquet floors, in need of a new wood finish and wax; and tall windows, their glass slightly grimy, facing east and west. Throughout, the apartment is furnished with a capricious, cluttered mix of things: old and new, exotic and native, precious and worthless, inherited and acquired.\nArhangel'skii ushers me into the apartment's most spacious room, serving as living room, dining room, and guest bedroom, and leaves me there with Volodya while he goes off in search of a bottle of Georgian champagne. The room's furnishings include several glass-fronted bookcases, an assortment of wooden and upholstered chairs, a table, and two divans -- the newest of which Arhangel'skii says was manufactured in Romania and, though purchased less than two years ago, has already collapsed. Among the room's smaller treasures are an end-table with a carved wooden base and hand-worked brass top, bought in Pakistan; a turn-of-the-century inkwell of wood and copper encrusted with agate and lapis lazuli; and numerous framed oil paintings: landscapes and family portraits.\nI chat with Volodya, whose English, acquired at school, is heavily accented but comprehensible. Looking and acting the part of the rebel son, he seems to be in the process of \"trying to find himself.\" He recently attempted to set up a business distributing videotapes of American films in Moscow, but the venture fell through. He is an avid fan of Sylvester Stallone, whom he describes as \"a beautiful actor.\" He also admires Anatoly Sobchak, the radical mayor of St. Petersburg, and Boris N. Yeltsin, then president of the Russian Federated Republic. (In August of this same year, during the attempted coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, Vladimir Alexandrovich stands guard, day and night, with the small band of men defending the Russian parliament building. Arhangel'skii, who has been away from Moscow during the coup, calls to tell me of his son's heroism. \"Perhaps Volodya was born just for this moment,\" he says.)\nArhangel'skii returns with the champagne, which he pours into three crystal glasses. \"Let us toast your visit,\" he says. Olga calls out from the kitchen and Arhangel'skii informs me that dinner will be served shortly. He and his son lift up a long wooden table, standing below the room's west-facing windows, and move it into the centre. He covers it with a white linen cloth, and then puts down bottles of champagne, wine, beer, cognac, and, of course, vodka. (I wonder if there will be any room left for the food.) He lays out old, gold-trimmed, cobalt-blue and white china, silverware, and sets of crystal glasses. Olga carries in the food: fresh breads, both white and brown; plates of sliced cucumbers, salamis, and smoked fish; a bowl of steaming, boiled potatoes; and kabachok, a peppery stew of carrots and vegetable marrow smothered in sunflower oil. \"In Russia,\" Arhangel'skii says as we sit down to eat, \"our shops may be empty, but our fridges are full.\"\nA.V. Arhangel'skii rises at nine o'clock each morning -- ten if he has taken more vodka than he is accustomed to the evening before. He does some calisthenics, then washes and shaves. (In Moscow, morning ablutions can demand a little more time than one might expect. Each summer, the authorities turn off the city's supply of hot water in order to overhaul the system; the repair period usually lasts one month, possibly two. At such times the Arhangel'skiis set three large, mineral-encrusted pots of water to boil each morning on the stove, carrying them into the bathroom as needed.) After dressing and, perhaps, splashing his freshly-shaven face with cologne, Arhangel'skii heads into the kitchen for breakfast.\nOn summer mornings, the wondrously cluttered kitchen, facing east toward the courtyard, is flooded with light. It is furnished with a gas stove, two refrigerators, a round table with plastic cloth, wooden chairs and stools. Its walls are covered with a green-and-white striped paper, peeling in places and splattered with age-old grease. Every available surface -- window sills, counter tops, cupboard-tops, refrigerator-tops, much of the green linoleum floor -- is smothered and weighted down. Dusty stacks of mathematical books and articles are piled up to the ceiling. Empty tins and canisters are strewn about, as well as lidless glass pickle jars. The rest of the available space is occupied by dozens of empty, sticky liquor bottles: I counted 40 vodka bottles on the three window sills alone.\n\"If you return these bottles for a deposit, they will give you fifty kopecks, which is not a bad amount,\" Arhangel'skii explains one morning. \"However, sometimes you might go to the store for a bottle of vodka, and they won't give you one unless you present them with an empty. I can solve many difficult math problems, but what to do with these bottles is a problem I cannot solve.\"\nArhangel'skii's breakfast is hearty, ritualistic, and languidly paced. \"I move slowly in the morning,\" he admits. He begins by making coffee -- grinding beans in an electric grinder, then carefully heating the fresh grounds in an ancient hand-engraved, copper dgezava. In traditionally Turkish fashion, he heats the coffee just to the boiling point, until it froths above the utensil's copper lip. He drinks one or two strong demi-tasse cups, then gets up from the kitchen table to prepare tea, which he does equally fastidiously, using a strikingly decorated ceramic pot purchased by his father at an industrial arts exhibition in 1939 and treasured ever since. Then it is time to think about food. Arhangel'skii loads the kitchen table with an earthy smorgasbord: plates of sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, salami; sheep's milk cheese from Bulgaria, sour cream, and curds; smoked-fish pate; cheese buns and, of course, dark, chewy rye. He will now spend an hour or two easing himself into the new day, slowly digesting the meal and the morning paper. It will then be time to head into his study to think about mathematics.\n\"I cannot resist the temptation to do mathematics,\" he says. \"It is an obsession, perhaps a disease. Sometimes I feel that I should spend more time with my family, but mathematics draws me away. There have been times when I haven't done any math for six months, but then I have been completely drawn into it again. I cannot calculate when those periods of activity or inactivity will be.\n\"It used to be, when I was younger and I had many duties, I had to look for the time for mathematics, so I had a plan to sit down every day at eleven o'clock, whether or not I had an idea, or even knew what I was going to think about. I discovered, when I sat down in the quiet, ideas would come. When I was younger, I also found that I could work anywhere: on the street, on the bus. I remember I was sitting on a bus, talking to a colleague about something unimportant, when I suddenly got my idea for a `p-space.'\n\"Now I don't have so many duties, so I don't have to struggle to find time for mathematics. But I am very driven by my desire, so I don't get distracted.\"\nDuring the school year, which runs from September to mid-June, Arhangel'skii's teaching duties take him to the campus of Moscow State University several times a week. He leads two seminars: the first, for his graduate students, takes place at six o'clock on Monday nights; while formally scheduled to last two hours, it often stretches into three, possibly four. The second, a higher-research-level seminar, is reserved for members of the Chair of General Topology and Geometry. It is scheduled to take place on Thursdays from four p.m. to six. On top of this, he may be asked to deliver a first-year unified course on linear algebra and analytic geometry, or a beginner's course in topology. These usually demand four hours per week. \"I sometimes like to give these undergraduate lectures, because I might directly or indirectly inspire students to study topology,\" he says. Generally, however, undergraduate-level courses at Moscow State University are taught by docents. Except for the hours that he is expected to lecture, and the time it takes to prepare for them, Arhangel'skii's time is free to conduct his own research. As is the case for all mathematics professors employed by M.S.U., he has not been allocated a private office there and thus must work in the library or at home. \"Maybe this is a problem,\" Arhangel'skii says. \"But when P.S. Alexandroff and A.N. Kolmogorov set up the department, they did not think it was important for us to have private offices. They believed that we could think while walking about the corridors, as monks do walking about quadrangles.\"\nArhangel'skii's study, the most beautifully appointed and traditional room in the apartment, is the primary locus of his mathematical thinking. It is decorated with a gold wallpaper, patterned with stars, and with three utterly different Oriental carpets: one, in reds and blues, on the parquet floor; another, geometrically patterned in reds, black, and white, thrown, according to Russian custom, over the settee; and a third, in shades of gold and brown with touches of red and black, hanging on the nothern wall. These dizzily contrasting patterns give the study the atmosphere of a mosque.\nAn old square wooden desk with a deeply scratched top stands by a wall of windows that look out eastwards on a view of birch trees and spires. Against the southern wall leans a lacquered bookcase, its lower shelves crammed with books and journals on mathematics, most of them in Russian, a few in English. The upper shelves are lined with literature, mainly American and French classics. Madame Bovary, Le Rouge et Le Noir, and several volumes of A la Recherche du Temps Perdu stand side by side with Life on the Mississippi and For Whom The Bell Tolls. There are also numerous language dictionaries: English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.\nOn the same wall hangs a collection of photographs and paintings, the latter the work of Arhangel'skii's maternal grandfather, Pavel Alexandrovich Radimov. Among the photographs is a round-framed, sepia-toned portrait of an aristocratic- looking woman with narrow eyes, aquiline nose, fine lips, and dark hair combed loosely back in a bun. This was Arhangel'skii's paternal grandmother, Anastasi Yevgrafovna Arhangel'skaya. It was she who commissioned the magnificent turn-of-the-century chandelier of bronze, crystal, and cobalt-blue glass that illuminates the room; and she, too, who began the education of its present occupant.\n\"She was a teacher,\" says Arhangel'skii, leaning back in the settee. \"When I was four or five, she taught me how to read and write. She also taught me a bit of German. Mostly she was reading to me, religious stories from the Bible. She was a religious woman; she took me to church when I was young -- she even had me baptized. My father also taught me when I was young. He gave me mathematical problems to solve, merchant's problems [word problems]. He also gave me geometry problems. He cut out paper triangles and asked me which ones were congruent. My father had a passion for mathematics.\n\"I think that it was always in my own character to be a mathematician. I believe I was always interested in this striving for the perfection of thought. I do remember clearly that, from a very young age, eight or nine, perhaps, I began to ask myself philosophical questions, which rightly belong to the study of the foundations of mathematics. I remember, for example, asking myself why the answer to 2 + 3 is the same as the answer to 3 + 2. Not many young boys would ask themselves why.\"\nA.V. Arhangel'skii was born on March 13, 1938, in an old hospital which still stands on Kalinskii Prospect near Arbat Street. His father, Vladimir Alexandrovich Arhangel'skii, was a concert pianist who had begun his career as an aeronautical engineer, rising to become director of the prestigious Central Aerohydro Dynamical Institute in Moscow. \"He told me that if he had studied to be a mathematician,\" recalls Arhangel'skii, \"he would not have switched careers.\" His mother, Marija Pavlova Radimova, was a celebrated painter. His godmother (and his father's first wife), Marija Alexandrovna, was the daughter of the famous Russian composer Scriabin.\nDuring his mother's pregnancy, Arhangel'skii's father was arrested and accused of being a German spy. \"My father had travelled a lot during the 1930s. He went to Germany, Austria, maybe even France, playing concerts on the piano. He also travelled all over the Soviet Union, even to the very far east. He wanted to play for simple people. He put his Steinway in the back of a truck, stabilizing it with special shock absorbers he designed himself, so he could drive on very bad roads.\n\"He was arrested in Khabarovsk [a city in the far east of the Soviet Union, on the Amur River, just north of the border with China] and held for some months. The security police were suspicious of this Russian concert pianist, travelling by himself so far from Moscow, with all these foreign stamps in his passport.\"\nVladimir Alexandrovich was lucky to be released. \"It just so happened that around the time of my father's arrest, my uncle, Alexander Alexandrovich, who had become an important aviator, was being awarded a prestigious prize for the design of a Russian fighter-bomber. Stalin even spoke with him personally to congratulate him. During their phone conversation, Stalin evidently asked my uncle if there was anything he could do for him. For a moment, my uncle wondered whether or not he should tell Stalin about my father's arrest and ask for his release. My uncle decided that he could not predict how Stalin would react, and so never said a word. My uncle did tell his superior, the chief of the Ministry of Aviation, who promised to investigate. He found out that the decision to arrest my father had been made only by the local authorities in Khabarovsk. These authorities were not following any orders from Moscow. So my uncle's superior went to see a minister of law, and not long after my father was set free.\"\nWhen Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in June of 1941, A.V. Arhangel'skii's parents feared that Moscow might become dangerous; and so in October of that year they sent him off to live with Alexander Alexandrovich, who had already been evacuated, along with his airplane factory, to Omsk, in the heart of Siberia. On the western wall of his study, tucked between the door frame and a Romanian-made cabinet, hangs a black-and-white photo of the boy and his uncle taken during that period of exile. Both are posed with their legs apart, hands thrust into their pockets. The boy wears a cap, giving him an oddly adult look.\n\"My uncle always loved this photo,\" Arhangel'skii says. \"He had no children of his own and so we were very close to one another. We remained close even when I reached adulthood, partly because he lived twenty years longer than my father.\"\nArhangel'skii returned to Moscow sometime after his fifth birthday. From then on, he was raised in a fashionable, 1930s, high-ceilinged, two-roomed apartment: number 54, 5/7 Nemirovich-Dunchenko, centrally located between Red Square and Pushkin Square, off Gorky Street. He lived in this same apartment for 42 years, even after he married and had children of his own -- right up until the time that he and his family moved to Kutuzovskii Prospekt by means of a private trade. Thirteen storeys high, the apartment house used to be considered a skyscraper, and was known throughout Moscow as the \"Artist's House.\"\n\"Many famous Soviet artists lived there,\" Arhangel'skii says. \"The famous theatre producer Nemirovich Dunchenko, after whom the street was named, lived two floors below us. So did the famous actor Shtrauch, who played the role of Lenin in many movies. The widow of Chekhov lived just through the walls.\" Arhangel'skii lived on Nemirovich-Dunchenko alone with his father; for by the time he was four, his parents had parted ways. \"Mother wanted to keep me, but she thought my father's life was better organized than her own. She also thought that the schools were better in the centre of Moscow than where she was living and working as an artist in the village of Saltykovska, and no doubt she was right.\" Not long after Arhangel'skii's parents divorced, his mother met and married the painter Constantin Pavelovich Radimov.\nFor the most part, young Alexander Vladimirovich was content living in Moscow with his father. \"I know that, at some moments, I would have liked to live with my mother,\" he says. \"My father had a temper and he sometimes got very angry with me. He wanted me to do my duties in school. But I sometimes wasn't as well organized and disciplined as he wanted me to be. I didn't want to do my homework; I wanted to play soccer and volleyball in the courtyard. I wanted to read books by Walter Scott. He would yell at me for my bad marks. At those moments, I wanted to go and live with Mother. But I would see her often. She would come to Moscow to visit me every week or two.\nIn 1953, Vladimir Alexandrovitch Arhangel'skii married a young pianist, Varvara Gryaznaya, with whom he had two children. \"My half-sister lives in Moscow,\" A.V. Arhangel'skii says, ``My half-brother did, but he moved away. I don't see them very much, not because of any ill feelings, but because of lack of time. In fact, I miss my half-brother. My own mother had no other children but me.\" V.A. Arhangel'skii died in 1958, one year after his third wife.\n\"I think that living with my father made me self-sufficient at a very young age,\" Arhangel'skii says after a pause. While contemplating, he delicately bites his right fingernails and gently chews his upper lip. \"I am not saying that I was well-organized, just self-sufficient. At six, I would go to my grandmother's house all by myself. She lived near Arbat and I had to travel through all Moscow to reach her house. I remember, also, that the primary school that I went to was a little distance from our apartment. The school had no name, it was just called School Number 135. It was across Gorky Street, which had a lot of traffic. Crossing this street was a bit of an experience. I remember I was always late and would cross it in a sportive manner. I was proud of this.\"\nListening to him speak, I try to imagine the life of V.A. and A.V. alone together in the Artist's House on Nemirovich-Dunchenko. I imagine the father, seated at his Steinway grand piano, practising concertos in one room, while the son sits at his desk in another, day-dreaming over his school books. I begin to wonder if the father imparted to the son his love of classical music; if it was being reared in a house filled with music that would later influence the son to relate the moment of his discovering a mathematical truth to being overwhelmed by \"a feeling of harmony.\"\nArhangel'skii's memories, however, present a somewhat less romantic picture. \"When I was young, music students were coming to the house all the time to be taught by my father. They would practise scales, or parts of a piece, over and over again. Actually, I found this annoying to listen to. I did develop a love of classical music, much later, that was my own. I was influenced by my teacher P.S. Alexandroff. He loved classical music. Periodically, perhaps once a month, he gave talks on a chosen piece of music for any members of the Chair of Higher Geometry and Topology at Moscow State University who wanted to listen. These took place in the lounge of a campus dormitory. After a talk, he would play a recording of the music he spoke about for us to hear. He also would invite his close students to come to his house to listen to music.\"\nAt this mention of P.S. Alexandroff, I turn the discussion back to mathematics and ask Arhangel'skii to talk about his formal education.\n\"I remember that I always found geometry more satisfying than algebra,\" he recalls. \"Geometry is logical, rather than algorithmic. I liked that, when we started to learn geometry in school, we began with concepts and assumptions that seemed clear. I also liked that it wasn't experimental, like physics. For example, I remember that when we started to study electricity, it seemed that we did not really understand what we were speaking about. The study of geometry seemed to present the correct way of thinking, and it was a pleasure for me.\"\nThe Soviet public school system, into which young Alexander Vladimirovich entered was, and remains, structured in the following fashion. From the ages of four to six, a child could, if his or her parents wished and there was enough space, attend kindergarten. At seven, he began his primary education, which consisted of the first three or four grades, or \"forms.\" The fourth or fifth form, depending on the region, marked the start of his secondary education, which was subdivided into two consecutive parts, the second of which was optional and varied. The first four to five years constituted the \"secondary incomplete\" program that all Soviet children were required to finish. After its completion, however, most furthered their education with two more years of secondary study. Doing so, they could attend a technical or vocational school, or they could attend an academic school and, in this case, finish the \"secondary complete\" program.\n\"By the time I started my secondary-school education, I was interested in subjects other than mathematics,\" Arhangel'skii admits. \"I liked literature, very much. I also liked to write compositions. I remember that one of my teachers was urging me to study humanities. By then I had also developed some liking of physics, as well as biology. But only girls went into biology in those days. I had even wanted to become a movie director for a while, but this was hard to achieve! In the end, I decided to pursue mathematics.\"\nArhangel'skii entered Moscow State University in 1954. Then, as now, only a chosen few were accepted into its undergraduate mathematics program. The application process has also remained unchanged. An applicant, called an abiturient, must apply to the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, or Mekhmat, and must enter a nation-wide competition that entails the submission of grades and the taking of four entry examinations: two mathematics exams (one written and one oral), one physics exam (oral), and one Russian composition exam (written). Each year, roughly 275 students are admitted into the mathematics, and 175 into the mechanics (mathematical physics) program, selected from candidates from across the Soviet Union.\nThe undergraduate mathematics program has always been rigorous. There is, at present, no three- or four-year bachelor's-degree program in place. (The administration is, however, planning to introduce a four-year undergraduate-studies program.) All students enroll for at least five years and work towards their diplom. During the first two years, they are required to attend six to eight hours of scheduled lectures and exercise sessions, six days a week. On top of this, they are expected to work on assigned problems at home. In the third year, mandatory class hours are reduced somewhat, and, in each of the following years, they are reduced again. By the fourth year, however, the better students will try to produce a piece of original mathematical research.\n\"It is not necessary for a student to do so,\" Arhangel'skii explains, \"but every student will try, and it is by judging this work that we can decide whether or not to recommend that a student go on for their Ph.D. If a boy is really good, he will, in the fourth year, get a simple, original result. By the fifth year, he will produce something worth publishing.\" All undergraduate students must pass an oral exam covering the fundamentals of higher mathematics to attain their diplom.\nAccording to official procedures, students wishing to continue studying mathematics must work for two or three years at a scientific institute or an industrial establishment, to which they are assigned by the Ministry of Higher Education, before they may apply to enter a graduate program. A university's Academic Council can, however, (and did in Arhangel'skii's case) recommend that a given student be allowed to apply for graduate studies immediately after attaining the diplom. Each year, roughly 80 students of mathematics are permitted to enter the program at Moscow State University. Graduate students, called aspirants, must study for at least three years in order to receive their kandidat nauk. During this time, they attend seminars, work on a dissertation, and prepare for exams. There are two final stages in the process of obtaining the degree of kandidat nauk: first, a student must defend his dissertation (which must, at this point, have been published in a Russian journal of mathematics) before an academic council; second, a central government body, called the Vysshaya Attestatsionnaya Kommissiya, or VAK, must approve the degree. A.V. Arhangel'skii was awarded the degree of kandidat nauk in June of 1966.\nIt was due, in part, to P.S. Alexandroff that he had decided to specialize in topology. \"P.S. Alexandroff influenced me a lot. He had an impressive, charismatic personality. He was a humanist as well as a mathematician, with a gift for writing and speaking. During my first year as a student at Moscow University, he taught a course in analytic geometry. It was a required first-year course, and so I took it. Alexandroff, I remember, was an interesting lecturer, not always brilliant -- he would sometimes make a mess of the blackboard! -- but always emotional. He was also very attentive and polite when speaking with students after class. He would shake your hand and talk very kindly.\"\nArhangel'skii's interest in topology was also inspired by an introductory seminar on the theory of functions that he attended in his first year. It was given by the blind mathematician Vytushkin. \"He began introducing the study of `functions of a real variable,' `subsets of the real line and of the plane,' and some `set theory' [all of which provide the necessary background for the study of topology]. He gave us many problems, which we had to solve on our own, without referring to any books.\n\"I actually found this seminar very difficult and did not attend much. But I had my inclination for the foundations of mathematics. I was interested in the notion of `the cardinality of infinities,' of the idea of `countable' and `uncountable sets,' of the `convergence of functions.' All these ideas were being discussed in this seminar. Though I did not attend much, I followed what was being done through discussions with my friends on the bus.\"\n(Vytushkin's method of teaching mathematics -- encouraging students to solve problems independently, without the aid of textbooks -- was pioneered in Russia by Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin, a founder of what is known locally as \"The Moscow School of Mathematics.\" Luzin was born in 1883 in Siberia, the son of a merchant and grandson of a serf of Count Stroganoff (after whom the gourmet dish was named). He studied mathematics at Moscow University under Boleslav Kornelievich Mlodzeyevskii (who, in 1901, taught the university's first course on Georg Cantor's revolutionary \"theory of sets\") and Dmitrii Fedorovich Egorov. In 1917, he began teaching at Moscow University, giving a course on the theory of functions and the theory of sets. Luzin possessed an enthusiastic and charismatic character; his personal magnetism and the liveliness and theatricality of his lectures attracted an ardent group of brilliant young students -- including P.S. Urysohn and P.S. Alexandroff, founders of the Russian school of topology. Bonded together by their devotion to Luzin, his students formed a secret society, which they called \"The Order of Luzitania,\" in ironic reference to the American ship Lusitania, sunk by the Germans during World War I.)\nAt the end of Arhangel'skii's first year at university, P.S. Alexandroff began to conduct an introductory seminar in set-theoretic topology. \"This was not usual,\" he explains, \"for most seminars began in September, not in April or May. But Alexandroff had just returned to working in the area after a break. I came to Alexandroff, at the end of the first session, and told him I wanted to specialize in topology. I told him what I had already learned about functions and set theory from following Vytushkin's seminar on my own. At that time, Aleksei Serpionovich Parhomenko was an assistant professor in topology. Alexandroff went to Parhomenko, told him of my interest in topology, and asked him to test my knowledge. Parhomenko met with me, and asked me if I could provide him with a set which is neither open or closed. And so I did. Parhomenko then went back to Alexandroff and told him, `Okay, this boy is serious.'\n\"In September of 1955, Alexandroff's seminar in topology began again. There were only ten students left out of fifty. I enjoyed it immensely, and was treated in this seminar as one who is well advanced. I liked that one's knowledge of topology proceeded from fundamental principles, and not a mixture of structures. Some people like to pull together a combination of things to make a system. But I am not a quick thinker, so I don't like to work with too many instruments at once.\"\nIn his book Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, American mathematician Morris Kline notes that no branch of mathematics, or even a major result, has arisen from the work of one man; at best, some decisive step may be credited to a single individual. The cumulative nature of the development of mathematics is especially evident in the history of non-Euclidean geometry. A complete account, such as Robert Bonola's Non-Euclidean Geometry, would have to consider the accomplishments of Gerolamo Saccheri (1667-1733), Georg S. Klugel (1739-1812), Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777), Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1780-1859), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855).\nBy the age of 15, Gauss had apparently grasped the idea that there could be invented a logically consistent geometry that was different from Euclid's. He began work on the creation of such a geometry around 1813, and there is evidence that he was successful. But because he never published any fully developed mathematical exposition of his work, historians of mathematics do not credit him as the discoverer of non-Euclidean geometry. That honour is usually reserved for two mathematicians who independently achieved results about the same time: Janos Bolyai and N.I. Lobacevskii.\nThere is some indication that Bolyai, a Hungarian, had realized his ideas on non-Euclidean geometry by 1825. In a letter to his father, the mathematician Wolfgang Farkas Bolyai, dated November 23, 1823, he wrote, \"I have made such wonderful discoveries that I myself am lost in astonishment.\" He did not, however, publish his results -- encapsulated in a 26-page paper entitled \"The Science of Absolute Space\" -- until 1832. The first mathematician to publish a definitive work on non-Euclidean geometry was Nikolai Ivanovich Lobacevskii. His paper, \"On the Foundations of Geometry,\" appeared in the Journal of the University of Kazan in 1829. He continued to develop and propagate his ideas in a series of papers, culminating in the \"Pangeometrie\" (1855), which he dictated as a blind old man who still retained his energy and strength of mind. He was, without doubt, Russia's first great mathematician.\nN.I. Lobacevskii was born on November 2, 1792, in the district of Makarief, roughly 200 miles due east of Moscow. He was the second of three sons of a minor government official. His father died when he was aged seven, leaving his mother, Praskovia Ivanovna, in extreme poverty. Soon after, she moved the family to the city of Kazan, several hundred miles further east, on the River Volga. In 1802, Lobacevskii was allowed to enter, as a free scholar, the local gymnasium. (Founded in the 18th century during the enlightened reign of Catherine I, Russia's gymnasia were classically-oriented, state-run schools whose curricula were designed to prepare young men for university. Their teaching programs emphasized the natural sciences and mathematics.) Five years later, at the precocious age of 14, he entered Kazan University, originally to study medicine. He was to spend the next 40 years of his life there, as a student, assistant professor, professor, and, ultimately, rector.\nKazan University had opened in 1804, during the reign of Alexander I, only three years before the arrival of Lobacevskii. While geographically isolated, in a location farther east than that of any Russian university, Kazan was nevertheless a thriving intellectual and cultural centre, tuned to modern European ideas and scientific developments. The university's sophistication and cosmopolitanism was due, in no small part, to the presence on staff of a number of well-recognized professors from Germany. It was Johann Martin Bartels (1769-1836) who had the most profound influence on Lobacevskii. He introduced the young mathematician to the most recent advances in \"differential and integral calculus,\" \"analytical mechanics,\" and ``the applications of analysis to geometry,\" as well as to the ideas of Gauss. Many years earlier, Bartels had tutored Gauss, and some scholars believe that Bartels may have relayed his former pupil's special interest in geometry to Lobacevskii. They are also certain, however, that the Russian came up with the mathematical ideas that founded his non-Euclidean geometry on his own.\nThe non-Euclidean geometry of N.I. Lobacevskii emerged out of a struggle to perfect the logical exposition of Euclid's Elements. As noted previously, Euclid began the Elements with a set of postulates and axioms (which he called \"common notions\"), as well as a preliminary set of definitions, which introduced his fundamental concepts, such as \"point,\" ``line,\" \"surface, \" etc. Modern geometers have recognized that Euclid's definitions are devoid of real meaning and serve no logical purpose: fundamental terms, such as \"point\" and ``line,\" are not made more fundamental, or rigorously defined, by such phrases as \"that which has no part,\" and ``breadthless length,\" even though the phrases are non-technical in nature. As Aristotle advised, a logical system must have a starting point and must, therefore, begin with concepts that stand undefined.\nWhile Euclid's definitions sparked critical debate, it was concern over his fifth postulate that inspired the invention of non-Euclidean geometry. It states \"that if a straight line falling on two straight lines [see Figure 1, below] makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.\" Geometers, over the ages, never doubted the truth of the above postulate; they felt, however, that it lacked the simplicity and elegance of statement displayed by Euclid's other preliminary assumptions. From Euclid's own time, they struggled to restate it, or to render it superfluous by deducing it as a theorem from his other preliminary assumptions. In 1795, John Playfair restated Euclid's fifth postulate in a simpler but logically equivalent fashion. His postulate, the one still taught in high-school geometry courses, states: \"Through a given point P, not on line l [see Figure 2, below], there is one, and only one, line in the plane of P and l, which does not meet l. The line through point P, which does not meet line l, is that which is parallel to line l.\"\nN.I. Lobacevskii agreed with John Playfair and others that Euclid's fifth postulate -- also called the parallel postulate -- was not superfluous, but necessary for the founding of classical geometry. Lobacevskii realized, however, that replacing Euclid's parallel postulate with a contrary assertion was the key to the creation of a new geometry -- just as rich, complete, and logically consistent as that developed by the Greeks. The Russian mathematician thus set down an assertion opposing the parallel postulate, adjoined it to Euclid's remaining axioms and postulates, and began to develop his own geometrical theorems.\nHis parallel postulate was somewhat complex in both its form and content. As recorded in his paper \"New Foundations of Geometry with a Complete Theory of Parallels\" (1835-37), it asserted, generally speaking, that through a given point P not on line l, there is more than one line in the plane of P and l that, no matter how far extended, will remain parallel to l. To reiterate Lobacevskii's parallel postulate more precisely: given a line l and a point P not on line l (see Figure 3, below), there are two lines, q and r, such that, given any other line s through point P, s will either meet l, if it does not lie between lines q and r, or s will not meet l, if it does lie between lines q and r.\nIt's true that our figurative representation of Lobacevskii's postulate is not accurate: the dotted lines that we have drawn lying between lines q and r would, if extended further, in our figure, meet line l -- as would lines q and r themselves. Our difficulty in representing Lobacevskii's postulate does not, however, show that it is false or that its assumption will lead to illogical consequences. It reflects the fact that Lobacevskian geometry is not in accordance with our intuitive picture of space. Indeed, Lobacevskian geometry contains a number of fundamental theorems that, upon first encounter, seem strange and impossible. For example, in Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles of every triangle equals 180 degrees. In Lobacevskii's geometry, the sum of the angles of every triangle is less than 180 degrees. Furthermore, as the area of a triangle increases in size, the sum of its angles decreases.\nThe great English geometer William Kingdom Clifford commented eloquently in 1872: \"What Vesalius was to Galen, what Copernicus was to Ptolemy, that was Lobacevskii to Euclid. There is, indeed, a somewhat instructive parallel between the last two cases. Copernicus and Lobacevskii were both of Slavic origin. Each of them has brought about a revolution in scientific ideas so great that it can only be compared with that wrought by the other. And the reason of the transcendent importance of these two changes is that they are changes in the conception of the cosmos.\" The invention of non-Euclidean geometry meant that the system perfected by Euclid could no longer stand with absolute authority. Mathematicians became convinced that the truths of Euclidean geometry, as they relate to space, are not \"self-evident,\" or ``necessary,\" or given ``a priori,\" as the philosopher Kant had held. They are merely founded upon experience and, therefore, their veracity could be tested by means of scientific experiment; although Euclidean geometry seemed to reflect accurately the properties of space, further investigations in astronomy might reveal otherwise.\nThe question of the relevance of non-Euclidean geometry to the study of space gained prominence after the publication of \"On the Hypotheses which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry\" (Ueber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen) by Bernhard Riemann. The ground-breaking treatise was originally delivered as a probationary lecture before the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Gottingen in 1854. At the time, the brilliant German mathematician was twenty-eight years of age and attempting to qualify for the position of privatdozent. Startling in its originality and scope, the content of his lecture would serve to revolutionize the treatment of space in the realms of philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Riemann attempted, in his exploration of the foundations of geometry, to uncover what facts, derived through the experience of physical space, are presupposed by the geometer (Euclidean and non-Euclidean alike), before he can begin to lay down the axioms and postulates of his science. He argued that intrinsic to the pursuit of geometry is a primary presupposition of an abstract concept of \"a space,\" mathematical in nature, which had not yet been elaborated upon at all. The topic for Riemann's Probe-Vorlesung had been chosen by none other than the eminent Gauss. Though Riemann had produced no previous work on geometry, Gauss intuited that the subject would spark the imagination of an eclectic mathematician whose interests extended into regions of physical science. Riemann showed a passion for physics that is uncommon to the vast majority of pure mathematicians. \"From this distance,\" E.T. Bell wrote in Men of Mathematics (1937), \"it seems as though Riemann's real interest was in mathematical physics and it is quite possible that had he been granted twenty or thirty more years of life he would have become the Newton or Einstein of the nineteenth century.\"\nAware that the audience for his lecture \"On the Hypotheses which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry\" included those with extensive and little mathematical training, Riemann tried to present his ideas with few technical calculations or proofs. (He provided these in a second paper, published in Volume 13 of the Abbandlundgen of the Royal Society of Sciences of Gottingen.) In a philosophical manner, Riemann first and foremost introduced what he called \"the concept of manifolds, multiply, or n-fold, extended.\" He defined, that is to say, his notion of \"a mathematical space\" of n, of one, two, four, eight, or any finite number of dimensions, elaborating upon the means by which any such given space could be constructed and subjected to measurement. (Note that Riemann employed the term manifold to denote his concept of a mathematical space. It is the translation into English of the German mannigfaltigkeit, used by Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason to refer to the \"sensible world of experience.\" Prior to Riemann, Gauss -- to whom Riemann is intellectually indebted -- borrowed the term from the German philosopher, employing it in a mathematical sense in 1831.)\nRiemann's concept of a mathematical space or manifold was born of the fundamental workings of \"analytic geometry\" (which represents curves by means of algebraic equations). He defined a manifold as an abstract geometric object composed of points, whose positions could be uniquely determined by a given number of \"coordinates.\" To understand something of the above, let us look at the Euclidean plane as Riemann would have done. We must first set aside Euclid's definition of the plane as \"that which has length and breadth only,\" and define it as a \"manifold\" composed of points, each of whose positions can be determined by two numbers, x and y. (See Figure 4, below.) It is evident that the position of points A, B, and C can each be determined by two numbers, or \"coordinates,\" one horizontal and one vertical. The above representation of the plane is, in fact, no different from that introduced by Rene Descartes and Pierre Fermat in the 17th century. Riemann, however, envisioned the Cartesian plane in a new light as a two-dimensional manifold or space unto itself. He considered it two-dimensional by virtue of the fact that every point in it can be located by means of two measures. With this loose understanding of the nature of dimension, it was then possible for him to envision the possibility of three-, four-, five- or n-dimensional manifolds or spaces -- all of whose points could be located by three, four, five, or n coordinates.\nHe further explored the reality of n-dimensional manifolds by introducing the means by which the distance between points of any such given manifold could be measured. At its simplest, his method employed a formula for measuring the distance between two points of the Cartesian plane. That formula states that the distance between any two points, A and B, of the plane (each of which can be located by two coordinates, x and y, and x' and y', respectively) equals EQUATION HERE. Such a formula involves a translation of the Pythagorean theorem into the language of analytic geometry. Riemann, however, extended the above formula. For example, to measure the distance between two points, A and B, of a five-dimensional manifold (each of which could be located by five coordinates, x, y, z, w, v and x' y' z' w' v', respectively) he used the following formula: Distance AB = EQUATION HERE.\nRiemann also closely considered a class of n-dimensional manifolds for which the above formula for measuring the distance between points was insufficient. Such abstract spaces, Riemann envisioned as curved -- in the way, for example, that the surface of a sphere is curved. In fact, just as Riemann could, through a leap of the imagination, see the plane as a \"flat\" two-dimensional space, he also could see the surface of a sphere as a \"curved\" two-dimensional space. To be sure, this characterization of the surface of a sphere was already implicit in Gauss's General Investigations of Curved Surfaces (1827). Riemann, however, made his master's implicit assumptions explicit. He also extended Gauss's methods (which involved the calculus, as well as analytic geometry) to construct and measure the distance between points of curved spaces of n-dimensions.\n(Riemann regarded the physical space of our perceptions as but one possible three-dimensional manifold, whose properties could be determined only through experiment. He recognized that, while any given n-dimensional manifold, is, in its essence, an abstract, imaginary, mathematical object, it could, perhaps, serve as a \"model\" of physical space; indeed, a crucial area of modern mechanics entails the struggle to determine through experimentation which \"mathematical model\" most closely approximates the reality of physical space. Riemann's thoughts on the nature of space were prophetic: 62 years after the delivery of his famous treatise, his definition of an n-dimensional manifold proved indispensible to the work of 20th-century physicists and cosmologists, such as Albert Einstein. In fact, the mathematical model of physical space employed by Einstein, in his General Theory of Relativity (1916) was, in precise terms, a curved Riemannian manifold of four dimensions. Einstein interpreted the term dimension in the same way that Riemann did: as the number of coordinates needed to locate each point in a given space. He also employed Riemann's formula for measuring the distance between points in space.)\nThe concept of \"a multiply-extended manifold\" forever transformed and broadened the mathematical meaning of the term space. Mathematicians, pursuing Riemann's ideas at the turn of the 19th century, began to consider a variety of unified collections of geometric and non-geometric objects (such as points, lines, spheres, or functions), together with a means by which the objects could be shown to relate to one another (such as a means for measuring the distance between them) as \"spaces\" unto themselves. Through a process of abstraction, they thus began to construct and explore a variety of mathematical spaces -- Riemannian, projective, metric, function, and, of course, topological. They classified such spaces into their respective types according to which relations were specified as binding together their component parts. The constructing of abstract spaces -- which entails using the concepts and methods of geometry -- proved highly advantageous to mathematicians (and scientists) for the solving of diverse problems. Geometric ideas, however abstract, retain their intuitive appeal, sometimes allowing complexities to be grasped at once, without the need for long calculations.\nMathematicians accomplish the construction of abstract spaces through definitions: philosophically speaking, the definition and construction of an abstract space is one and the same thing. The definition of a topological space is both similar to and different from that of a Riemannian space. It, too, is defined as an abstract geometric object, composed of points, in conjunction with a specified means of showing how the points relate to one another. Essential to Riemann's definition of an n-dimensional manifold is the means by which the distance between its points (located by n coordinates) can be measured. The definition of a topological space, however, does not specify that its points are to be located by means of Cartesian coordinates. It also does not specify how to measure the distance between them. It merely specifies how the points can be shown to relate to one another in terms of neighborhoods. The notion of a neighborhood describes the relationship between one of a space's points to a sub-collection of its points; it describes, that is, the state of one point in a topological space being near -- infinitely near, in fact -- to a sub-collection of its points, without the measurement of any distances whatsoever. (Hence a topologist might tell you, without a trace of irony or whimsy, that he is consumed, above all, with the study of \"nearness without distance.\") The definition of one particular topological space differs from the definition of another in terms of which points, and which sub-collections of points, or \"neighborhoods,\" are specified.\nThe importance of the notion of neighborhood and its utility in the definition of a topological space was propagated by the German mathematician Felix Hausdorff. Born at Breslau in 1868, Hausdorff attained his doctoral degree at the University of Leipzig in 1891. His early scientific work concerned the physics of light; however, he turned his attentions to pure mathematics soon after 1900. He was eventually appointed a professor of mathematics at the University of Bonn. While not primarily a topologist, Hausdorff published in 1914 a book, Essentials of Set Theory (Grundzuge der Mengenlehre), that established him as a major figure in the newly developing field. In it he gave the first popular definition of a topological space (known today as \"a Hausdorff space\") as a collection or ``set\" of elements (points), to each of which correspond certain subsets of the set called neighborhoods, such that:\n(A) To each point x, there corresponds at least one neighborhood Ux, and Ux contains x.\n(B) If Ux and Vx are neighborhoods of x, there exists another neighborhood of x, Wx, which is a subset of Ux and of Vx.\n(C) If y is in Ux, there is a neighborhood Uy of y such that Uy is a subset of Ux.\n(D) For two distinct points, x and y, there exist two neighborhoods, Ux and Uy, with no point in common.\nHausdorff's definition of a topological space, along with the theory he began to build in chapters seven and eight of his Essentials of Set Theory, caught the interest of a number of brilliant mathematicians who lived primarily in Russia and Poland; these included Pavel Sergeevich Alexandroff (A.V. Arhangel'skii's mentor), Pavel Samuelovich Urysohn, and Andre Nicholaevich Tychonoff (founders of the Moscow school of topology); as well as Waclaw Sierpinski and Casimir Kuratowski (founders of the Warsaw school of topology). They produced many of the formative works on set-theoretic topology, published in the years following World War I. The most significant and influential of these was, perhaps, Alexandroff's and Urysohn's Memoir on Compact Topological Spaces (Memoir sur les espaces topologiques compactes), written during the summer of 1922. The two young Russians had rented a room in a dacha on a bank of the Klyaz'ma River, opposite the village of Burkovo, not far east of Moscow. They passed the unusually hot, sunny months, bathing, boating, walking, and fervently contemplating and conversing about mathematics. Their joint intellectual effort produced their famous monograph, in which they defined a number of famous spaces, all of them topological, including \"the compact space,\" \"the double-arrow space,\" ``the Alexandroff duplicate,\" and \"the lexicographically-ordered square.\"\nOn the morning of a warm, sunny Sunday, A.V. Arhangel'skii and I set off by train for the village of Abramtsevo, some 50 miles north-east of Moscow. Abramtsevo is well known to scholars of Russian architecture and design. In the late 1870s, Savva Mamontov, a Russian railroad magnate and philanthropist, transformed his country estate there into an artists' retreat. Mamontov also commissioned artist Viktor Vasnetsov to design and supervise the construction of an estate church. Completed in 1882, the graceful, white, golden-domed structure, playfully modelled on medieval architectural forms and decorated with abstract mosaics of coloured stones, represented the beginning of the Russian style moderne, a national variation of art nouveau. In 1934, Arhangel'skii's maternal grandfather, Pavel Alexanderovich Radimov, sought and won state permission for the building of a \"painters' settlement\" of dachas on lands adjacent to the Mamontov estate (now a public museum).\nThere is no station to welcome our arrival at Abramtsevo -- just a cracked concrete platform and rusted sign affixed to an iron railing much in need of paint. Immediately upon stepping off the narrow platform, we are walking on a dirt path under a canopy of leaves. Drawn, as if by force, into a forest of green light and shadow, where the air is cool and marvellously fragrant, we soon come upon a small wooden bridge, and cross over a stream.\n\"This piece of land symbolizes Russia for me,\" Arhangel'skii says. \"It is where I spent the summer months when I was a child -- swimming, fishing, hunting for mushrooms.\" He pauses for a moment to look down at the stream and up at the tall white birches, poplars, oaks, and spruce sheltering both banks. \"The river is not as clear as it was back then, \" he says with disapproval. \"I can see there is more algae growing in it. I think they have built some small factory a little ways upstream.\" We continue in silence along the path, until Arhangel'skii stops and pulls open a battered fence gate. \"Welcome to my dacha,\" he says, leading me toward a two-storeyed log cabin, screened from view by a stand of birches.\nHearing our voices, Arhangel'skii's wife, Olga Constantinovna, comes out front to welcome us, exchanges a few words with her husband, and heads off again to peel potatoes. Since the weather has been warm and dry for days, she has set up a wooden work table outside, laden with enamelled iron pails, pitchers, and pots. The dacha has no indoor plumbing, so Olga Constantinovna uses water from a hose -- its one end fastened round a nearby tree-trunk, its other attached to the settlement's main water line -- and from large iron drums placed below eavestroughs to catch the rain.\nArhangel'skii suggests that while his wife cooks dinner, we take a look at the dacha and then, perhaps, have a snack. Stepping through the front door into a small entrance hall, we turn right to enter a narrow kitchen, furnished with a rustic wooden table and stools, an old refrigerator and hot plate, and open shelves stacked with well-worn dishes, pots, and pans. It is cool and dark: ceiling, walls, and floor are all finished in a rough, deeply stained wood. Off the kitchen is a small bedroom, with two settees, and what would be a spacious living area, were it not cluttered with aged sofas, cabinets, tables, chairs, and piles of raw lumber. Apologizing for the mess, Arhangel'skii explains that he has been trying to stock up on materials -- available only on the black market -- for the construction of a second floor to accommodate guests. Last summer, he had a wooden staircase built as a preliminary. \"It was made by two drunkards from the next village who, together, consumed three bottles of vodka a day. I had to provide the vodka as part of their payment.\" The staircase looks surprisingly solid, nonetheless.\nWe decide to have our snack on a side porch. Unpacking a bag of food he has brought from home, Arhangel'skii cuts each of us a slice of dark Russian rye, Bulgarian feta, and tomato. He opens a bottle of vodka and pours out two small glasses. \"This is all one needs to be happy,\" he says. \"Just a bit of vodka and some small snack.\" We eat and drink, looking on to the treed yard and listening to the wind, the hum of crickets, and the crowing of a rooster.\n\"When I was a boy, my grandfather kept pigs and cows at his dacha,\" Arhangel'skii recalls. \"I remember drinking fresh milk. Nowadays, people only keep a few chickens.\" He gets up and paces about the yard for a few moments, muttering that he must cut its long, tangled grass. He inspects the health of a number of trees, looking with satisfaction at a pine. \"There were no pine trees here when we had this dacha built. I wanted pines, so I transplanted a few from the nearby forest.\" Arhangel'skii brings his right hand to his forehead to shield his eyes from the sun, then draws my attention to a dacha standing behind his own. \"That was the dacha my father built and that I visited as a boy. Today it is occupied by the president of the Soviet Union of Painters, the grandson of Viktor Vasnetsov, who designed the Mamontov church.\"\nThe construction of Arhangel'skii's own dacha was overseen by his wife in 1975, while Arhangel'skii was in Pakistan, teaching at the University of Islamabad under a program sponsored by UNESCO. \"I was the official UNESCO expert on topology, which I thought was quite an original title.\" Although Arhangel'skii has eagerly embraced such rare opportunities for travel as were afforded to Soviet citizens (in the 1960s he participated in an experimental cultural-exchange program, staying for three weeks in the U.S. and Canada), it was not wanderlust that prompted his trip to Pakistan. \"My material conditions at that time were not very good. I had to support a young family and affording anything presented a problem. While pure mathematicians are well respected in Russian society, that respect has not been reflected in our salaries. At the time that I decided to go to Pakistan, I couldn't afford such things as a dacha, or even a car.\n\"I left Russia two months before my family did and found and rented a house in the capital. When I arrived, I discovered that the University of Islamabad was on strike, so I didn't have to teach for my first half a year. Afterwards, I taught undergraduate courses in topology and set theory. Roughly five students out of thirty were talented and worth working with. Unfortunately, I did not find it easy in Pakistan to conduct my own research. I just couldn't establish a favourable routine. I also found it difficult to live amongst people who had to suffer such impoverished conditions, conditions that degraded the human spirit.\"\nI ask Arhangel'skii why the Soviet authorities would allow his wife and children to leave the U.S.S.R. and accompany him to Pakistan. \"Weren't they afraid that you would defect?\"\n\"No,\" Arhangel'skii explains with a grin. ``The authorities believed that the family would keep you tied to the state. If a man goes away from his family for too long, he may have some small romantic adventure and forget them, and his country too. But I could never leave Russia as long as my mother is alive.\"\nIn 1959, the year he married Olga Constantinovna, Arhangel'skii produced his first important mathematical result. His definition of the concept of \"a network\" distills within it the \"topology\" or the inherent structure of ``compact topological spaces.\" Since that time he has published roughly 120 papers, both research and survey articles, in such journals as Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Mat. Zametki, Uspekhi Mat. Nauk, and Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR. He has also written four books: Cantorian Set Theory, Linear Algebra (both textbooks for undergraduates), General Topology (co-written with V.I. Ponmarev and consisting entirely of questions and answers), and CP Theory (one of Arhangel'skii's more recent interests, which discloses the topological structure of \"a function space\").\n\"It has never been more important for me to solve a problem than to create a new concept,\" he says. \"A major part of my work, therefore, has been to introduce new notions through which links can be found among seemingly disparate things. It would not have pleased me to have added one, two, or three more isolated pieces of information to the field. I would rather concentrate upon, understand, and develop a systematic body of knowledge encompassing some part of topology.\"\nHe has been described by a colleague as possessing \"an almost mystical intuition.\" In an effort to describe the nature of mathematical creativity, Arhangel'skii refers to his sensitivity to beauty, his tangible awareness of the harmonious. \"Beauty is, for me, a sign of the truth. . . . When I think about a mathematical problem or theorem, my intuition suggests to me what should be true: I will see relationships between properties or results, and these relationships will suggest something new. I guess at the truth, even before I know the truth. When I believe something will be true, there is also usually suggested to me a way to prove it. And when I try to prove it, I will sometimes feel things fitting together harmoniously. It is from this feeling of harmony that I know my way will work.\"\nFitting words for the son of a concert pianist and painter. He is, of course, not the first mathematician to link mathematics and beauty. The 20th-century English mathematician G.H. Hardy wrote: \"A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made of ideas. . . . The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or poet's, must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.\"\nHardy argues that the beauty of a mathematical theorem lies in its seriousness -- measured not in terms of its practical consequences but in terms of the significance of the mathematical ideas with which it connects. Arhangel'skii would add that the beauty of a mathematical theorem lies in its unexpectedness.\n\"You may come upon a theorem that is not, in itself, difficult to prove,\" he says. \"In fact, it may be very simple, yet unexpected, and because of this it brings delight.\" He compares this delight to that felt by the first explorers \"to go around the world in one direction and suddenly find themselves returning to their starting place.\"\nA mathematician's power, according to Arhangel'skii, lies mainly in his ability to envision a highly abstract concept by means of \"an effective image.\" (I can understand what he means: my husband has told me that he sometimes thinks of topological spaces as living creatures, imagining them to be divided up into different species.) \"When a mathematician begins to ponder such things as `a compact topological space,' he thinks about it in a way that seems to him quite simple. I might, for example, imagine it as a line segment, or a circle, or a sphere. I have in my head a kind of encyclopedia of images, mainly simple geometric constructions, such as those I just mentioned, that I use to represent the various known topological spaces. You must remember that topology is, in its essence, a kind of abstract geometry. To construct a new topological space, you have got to first imagine that space, to envision its points and neighbourhoods. You have got to be inspired. You cannot create a space using formulas or arguments of logic. To create a new space, I might try to combine, or `glue together,' a number of existing spaces, like building blocks. Geometric images can be very helpful here.\"\nImages are crucial for mathematicians, such as topologists, who work with infinity. \"The infinite exists simply because we imagine it to, because we invoke its existence. The mathematics of the infinite can never be reduced to algorithms or calculations; it can never be formalized. It is inherently fraught with paradoxes and contradictions. Mathematics teaches a person the laws of the infinite. It domesticates the infinite, makes it familiar. But our desire to work with the infinite comes from our understanding that it can never be reduced to the finite. It is the desire to be in touch with something mystical. The infinite exists like God exists. We can try to understand Him, knowing we can never see Him completely.\"\nOne of Arhangel'skii's earliest survey papers on topology -- \"Mappings and Spaces,\" published in Russian Mathematical Surveys in 1966 -- is prefaced by two lines that I thought he had borrowed from a Russian poet:\nOn the Edges of Darkness\n     I sing of Your Galaxies.\n\"Many people have asked me about this quote,\" he says. ``But I did not take it from any famous poem; I wrote it myself. When I was younger I wrote many poems, perhaps thirty or more. They were often very short, just a few lines. I wrote this one three years before the paper. I don't really understand where it, or the others, came from.\"\nArhangel'skii, who refers to his mathematical results as his \"children,\" finds it difficult to single out one result as standing above the rest. If gently pressed, however, he will admit to being most pleased with his resolution of P.S. Alexandroff's problem regarding the possible \"cardinality\" of \"a compact, first-countable topological space.\"\n\"Yes, that was probably my best work,\" he says. ``Solving that question really meant something to me because I kept leaving and returning to it for a period of several years. It was, for me, a favourite problem. When I saw the answer, I saw it very clearly. It seemed very simple, so I was afraid it must be wrong.\n\"I obtained the result sometime between the first and tenth of May, 1969, and it was published three months later. I solved it sitting like Archimedes in the bathtub. I had a habit of thinking in the bath, where I could lie and relax for three or four hours at a stretch. The sound of water dripping from the faucet would block out all other sounds and put me into a meditative state. That night, I lay in the bath thinking from about ten-thirty to three a.m. Then I went to sleep. In the morning, when I woke up, I felt the problem was solved.\"\n\"Did you shout `Eureka'?\" I ask.\n\"I wanted to,\" Arhangel'skii replies, smiling. ``But being too modest, I couldn't.\"\nIn February 1969, three months before he obtained his most significant result, A.V. Arhangel'skii was permitted to join the Communist Party. He did so, he said, because it was expedient. \"Not all professors at Moscow State University had wished to become members of the Party. Some professors did so in order to increase their chances for a promotion or for the opportunity to travel; others because they had wanted to gain a position of influence to enable them to help their students. I simply recognized that, to play a public role in the life of the university, I had to become a member.\" He slowed down the pace at which we had been walking. Having spoken for several hours on the side porch of his dacha, Arhangel'skii had stood up to stretch his long limbs, and suggested we take a short hike through the surrounding forest. Perhaps, he had said, we might also take a swim in a pond in which he had bathed as a child. We could, of course, continue our discussions as we walked. So we packed suits and towels into a string bag and set off alone from the dacha, following a dirt path in the dappled shade of birch and poplar trees. Arhangel'skii wielded an old, twisted walking stick in his left hand.\n\"Many more people actually wanted to become members of the Party than were allowed to,\" he continued as we walked. \"One's opportunity to join was supposed to have depended upon whether or not a position had become vacant. The availability of positions, however, did not arise in a `regular' way: if certain people wanted a friend, say, to be admitted, then, suddenly, `a vacancy' would open up -- whether or not anyone had actually left the Party. Furthermore, in order to become a member, you had to fill out a certain form; if, however, you were not issued such a form in the first place, then you could not become one.\" Arhangel'skii submitted his application form in April 1967, the year after he had been awarded his doctoral degree. \"It took me more than a year to enter the Party,\" he said, \"because I had signed a letter of protest, regarding the treatment of [A.S.] Esenin-Volpin.\n\"Esenin-Volpin was a topologist, older than myself, who had done mathematical research in the Forties. He was also the son of the famous Russian poet [Sergei Aleksandrovich] Esenin. I had known that my colleague had suffered a number of nervous breakdowns and had spent some time in mental hospitals. But one day, a friend of mine came to me and told me that Esenin-Volpin had been sent to a mental hospital against his will. He asked me to sign a letter of protest.\n\"Ninety-nine professors at Moscow State University signed this letter. Of those ninety-nine, only two were members of the Party. P.S. Alexandroff, who was a member, did not. I don't think I realized that it would be read aloud over the BBC and Voice of America.\n\"I was punished after this. I was not allowed to enter the Party when I applied, and I was reprimanded by officials in person, and in a written letter.\"\n\"Couldn't your punishment have been far worse?\"\n\"Yes, at another time, it might have been. But I didn't hesitate when my friend asked me to sign that letter. I signed in one minute. There was no deliberation. I wanted to state that there were some things that I could not accept.\"\n\"Were you involved in any other political protests?\"\n\"No that was the only serious step that I ever took. I was never again asked to take such a step. Actually, I do not think it was a bad move for my career. It may have even helped my career.\"\nI asked Arhangel'skii about his activities as a member of the Communist Party and about the role that the Party had played on the campus of Moscow State University.\n\"Being a Party member meant you had to fulfil certain obligations,\" he said. \"You had to join the `primary cell' of your workplace and pay a small due, roughly two to three per cent of your salary. You also had to allow your name to be listed on announcements of meetings, which were posted on a bulletin board near the faculty office. The primary cell of the university would meet twice per semester. At these meetings -- which were like sessions of a parliament -- all matters and questions concerning the life of the university or of a certain department were considered. It was discussed, for example, how to buy computers, or equipment for scientific research, or, perhaps, what direction in research a department should take. Such things as which students should be allowed to study for their Ph.D., and who should be appointed chairman of a certain department were also debated. It was understood that no final decisions about these questions could be made. However, the Party could, and did, make recommendations to different administrative bodies.\n\"As a member of the Party you also had to fulfil some duty, additional to those demanded of you by the university administration. For example, I became an editor of our faculty newspaper for a while. I was also elected to a kind of council that was responsible for finding people who would tutor students, free of charge -- students from socially backward areas of the U.S.S.R., who were not so well prepared for university. Other members were responsible for organizing sports activities, or picnics, or some other social events.\n\"None of these activities, however, have taken place for the past two years. They were stopped before the ban.\" (On the 20th of July, 1991, a few weeks before the attempted coup to overthrow Gorbachev, Yeltsin had issued a decree banning Communist Party organizations from operating in government offices and workplaces in the Russian Federated Republic.)\nI asked Arhangel'skii whether or not he had been happy to see the Party banned from Moscow State University. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"The university should not be an arena for Communist Party activities. It should be free from all politics. But there should be some organization that is responsible for arranging social and cultural activities for the students.\"\nOn several other occasions, I had heard Arhangel'skii refer to the Party as \"a Mafia.\" I had heard him complain that because of it, the wrong people were promoted into positions, for the wrong reasons. I had also heard him complain that corruption and sloth had become endemic in Soviet society. In the past, he had said, people worked because they were afraid. Now that they were no longer afraid, they did not want to work. It was only under a capitalistic system, he had said, that people had the motivation to work. Despite these comments, I had found Arhangel'skii's private stance toward the regime of the former U.S.S.R. complicated, if not paradoxical. He had been, for example, openly supportive of Mikhail Gorbachev, right up until the August coup, and expressed a lack of trust and faith in Boris Yeltsin. Furthermore, before the Communist Party's final demise, he had seemed hopeful that it would evolve and become a vehicle for social, political, and economic reform. He had remained a daily reader of Pravda, the Communist Party organ, until the day it ceased publication. Walking down Kutuzovskii Prospekt one day, he had pointed out, ruefully, that in the recent past Moscow's shops could at least provide sustenance for its population. Yes, he had admitted, foods were not always of the finest quality or the most varied; nevertheless, no one had to do without. No one went homeless in Moscow either. He had seemed to wish to remind me that the forgotten and perverted egalitarian ideals of the Bolshevik revolution had, after all, been worthy. He had seemed to feel sorrow for the death of the 19th-century utopian vision that had fuelled the Russian Revolution -- a vision, he, at the same time, believed was impossible to realize.\nSpeaking about the Russian Revolution, Arhangel'skii had said, \"In the nineteenth century, there existed a contrast between our intelligentsia and the common man. Our intelligentsia felt the greatness of this contrast, and it was this that led them to want to persuade others of the truth of their ideas -- or even to impose them. A society, however, should never be founded upon one single ideology. For there is always the possibility that the reasoning upon which one bases one's belief in the truth of that ideology will ultimately be proven false.\n\"Being a mathematician trains you to recognize the meaning of truth; it also trains you to recognize what is not the truth. Mathematicians, like philosophers, social scientists, or historians, work with abstract ideas. They are necessary in most disciplines for the developing of conclusions. But the abstractions that we work with in mathematics are rigorously defined. We can, therefore, be certain of the truth of the conclusions that we draw from them. When a mathematician reads philosophy, or social or political theory, he is often struck by the vagueness of the ideas and the muddiness of the logic.\n\"When you found a society upon one ideological system, you can end up with something that is intrinsically `double-faced.' Here in Russia we strove to create a society that was supposed to be good for the people, but we ended up with something that was not. We created a society in which a kind of schizophrenia became systemic: in which we learned to say one thing to each other, when we really meant to say the opposite. And this pathological condition began to seem normal.\"\nArhangel'skii's political views reminded me of those expressed by Alexander Herzen, a Russian writer of the 19th century. Best known for his arresting autobiography, My Past and Thoughts, Herzen produced some of the deepest of modern writings on the subject of human liberty. Although he began his intellectual career with a utopian faith in an archaic form of socialism, he refused to prescribe it as a remedy for social problems. He refused to condone the sacrifice of liberty, \"the liberty of living individuals with their own individual ends, the ends for which they move and fight and perhaps die,\" in the name of any abstraction.\nWe had been walking along the path for some time in complete silence. We had followed it, first, through the forest surrounding the settlement of dachas, back in the direction in which we had come from the train. We turned, however, away from the tracks, and crossed a wooden bridge over a narrow, muddy river, continuing for a mile or two along its reedy bank. Now and again, we looked across the sluggish water to the opposing bank to catch sight of a family at rest under the trees, the contents of a picnic laid out upon a moth-eaten blanket. In a few places, kids were swimming where the river had deepened and was less choked by reeds.\nAfter some steady walking, we came out of the forest into brilliant sunshine, turning away from the river and tramping through a field of tall, yellowy grass until we reached a country lane. We headed down this lane, passing a decrepit wooden cottage, surrounded by a small field of corn. At the bottom of the field, the land fell away, and there, before us, lay the dark, still waters of a pond, a few hundred yards across. \"Here we are,\" Arhangel'skii said, leading us off the road toward a grassy bank, where a few people were lying on towels, tanning themselves. We sat down for a minute, then took turns changing into our swimsuits behind a nearby clump of bushes. After changing, Arhangel'skii stood on the bank, doing vigorous deep-knee bends, toe-touches, and army-style stride jumps. Without pausing to catch his breath, he dove into the pond and began swimming the crawl toward the far side. I jumped in after him and gasped, stung by the coldness of spring water.\nWe swam for 10 minutes or so, dried off in the sun, then changed back into our clothes. Arhangel'skii said we had better head home; he did not wish to be late for dinner. Walking along the deserted path back to the dacha, we spoke of the changes that had just begun to transform Russia. While Arhangel'skii neither wholeheartedly lauded nor condemned communism, he also expressed no unbridled optimism for Russia's future. He hoped that all economic and social changes -- though necessary and desirable -- would be introduced slowly and carefully; he feared that sudden upheaval would give rise to chaos, poverty, suffering, and a possible return to Stalinism and repression. Despite his undeniably privileged position, he appeared worried about the well-being of his own family. \"In Russia,\" he remarked, ``we stand with our heads in the heavens, but our feet in the swamp. We are always well aware of our goals, but not the practical means by which we can achieve them.\"\nI asked Arhangel'skii what he hoped to accomplish in the future.\n\"My main goal,\" he said, ``is to understand topology as a whole, to understand better the relationship between different branches, the relationship between new concepts and old. I have, as you know, done work in a number of different directions. I would like to return to them and improve upon what I have done. I would also like to continue to develop some new directions. However, above all, I would like my knowledge to be universal in set-theoretic topology. Nowadays, this is a very difficult task. There are more and more bright young people coming up with deeper results. It is difficult to keep up.\"\n\"Do you believe, as G.H. Hardy believed, that `mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man's game?' \"\nArhangel'skii considered this question carefully, pausing a while before he replied. \"No, I disagree with Hardy. A mathematician does not necessarily do his best work when he is young. It is true that he doesn't need to learn to use sophisticated equipment. He also doesn't need to spend years in a lab working on an experiment before he can achieve an important result. To some extent, it may be true that it is easier for a young person to show his force, to solve a specific problem. However, one's intuition improves with age and experience, the experience of thinking about mathematics. It becomes easier to see how things are connected. . . .\" He paused again, then returned to the question, taking a different perspective. \"As a person ages, psychologically, he is inclined to become more realistic, to stand with his feet more firmly planted on the earth. A good mathematician, however, never grows old. He remains a child. He remains a dreamer: curious, imaginative, free of concrete purpose.\"\nWe had retraced the path back from the road, through the field, and along the bank of the river into the forest once again. The sun was beginning to set, and a diffused, ochrous light spilled through overhead leaves, polishing the slender, black and white trunks of birch trees. I stood still for a while to watch Arhangel'skii lightly threading his way between them. Catching up with him again, I asked if he ever found the effort to solve a difficult mathematical problem, frustrating or disagreeable, if the satisfaction came only fleetingly, when a problem had been finally solved.\n\"No, for me the satisfaction in doing mathematics is not with the result, but with the process. The joy that comes to me after I have attained a result is only the joy in remembering how I struggled to achieve it.\"\n"}, {"score": 403.73517, "uuid": "746c1ad1-2f0b-5f29-a7f4-bf06627fad25", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0009wb-65-10703", "target_hostname": "dst.gov.in", "target_uri": "http://dst.gov.in/about_us/ar00-01-sp-stw.htm", "page_rank": 1.1832808e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Welcome to Department <em>of</em> Science and Technology, Govt. <em>of</em> India ::", "snippet": "The new kiln consumes less fuel, produces <em>better</em> quality wares and <em>is</em> easy to construct and maintain.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 395.39154, "uuid": "67c462e0-25e3-5216-babc-5bdb020ba2d0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-70-08899", "target_hostname": "marchofdimes.com", "target_uri": "http://marchofdimes.com/pregnancy/stayingsafe_indepth.html", "page_rank": 1.2006273e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Environmental risks | Pregnancy | March <em>of</em> Dimes", "snippet": "Until there are <em>better</em> answers, you can take these steps to limit your exposure: * Don\u2019t use <em>plastic</em> containers with the number 7 <em>or</em> the letters PC (polycarbonate) <em>in</em> the triangle found on the bottom. * Don\u2019t microwave food <em>in</em> <em>plastic</em> containers <em>or</em> put <em>plastics</em> <em>in</em> the dishwasher. * Breastfeeding your", "explanation": null, "document": "Sign in or Sign up to save this page.\nYou've saved this page\nIt's been added to your dashboard\nRate this page\nSign in or Sign up to rate this page.\nHow helpful is this?\nClick on the stars below.\n4\nEnvironmental risks and pregnancy\nThere are more than 83,000 chemicals used in homes and businesses in this country, yet we have little information on how most of them may affect you and your baby during pregnancy. A small number of chemicals are harmful to your unborn baby. Most of these are found in the workplace, but certain pollutants that damage the air and water, as well as chemicals used at home, may pose a risk during pregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, you can inhale these chemicals, ingest them in food or drink, or, in some cases, absorb them through the skin. You have to come in contact with large amounts of dangerous chemicals for a long time in order for them to harm your baby.\nMost workplaces take steps to limit worker contact with chemicals. However, we don\u2019t really know how most chemicals may affect your health. Talk to your health care provider about chemicals used in your workplace before pregnancy if possible. If you\u2019re thinking of getting pregnant, you may need extra protection at work or a change in your job duties to stay safe. This is especially important if you work in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, dry cleaning, printing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and health care. You also can take steps to protect yourself and your baby from pollutants and chemicals used at home.\nWhat are the risks of lead exposure during pregnancy?\nLead is a metal that was used for many years in gasoline and house paint. Although lead still can be found in the environment, the amounts have decreased greatly since the 1970s when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned its use in these products. Lead poses health risks for everyone, but young children and unborn babies are at greatest risk. If you come in contact with high levels of lead during pregnancy, your baby may be at risk for miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight and developmental delays.\nIf you live in an older home, you may be exposed to lead in deteriorating lead-based paint. Many homes built before 1978 were painted with lead-based paint. As long as paint is not crumbling or peeling, it poses little risk. However, crumbling paint can make lead dust when the surface is touched, especially when it is sanded or scraped.\nIf lead-based paint needs to be removed from your home, stay away until the removal is complete. Only experts should remove leaded paint. The EPA has information about lead and lead removal.\nYou also can be exposed to significant amounts of lead in drinking water if your home has lead pipes, lead solder on copper pipes or brass faucets. Contact your local health department or water supplier to find out how to get pipes tested for lead. If you use well water, have your water tested regularly for lead and other contaminants. The EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 has more information on home water testing.\nThe EPA recommends running water for 15 to 30 seconds before using it for drinking or cooking to help reduce lead levels. Water from the cold water pipe contains less lead than water from the hot pipe, so use cold water for drinking, cooking and preparing baby formula. Many home filters don\u2019t remove lead, so look for a filter that is certified by http://www.nsf.org/ to remove lead.\nOther possible sources of lead in the home include:\nLead crystal glassware and some ceramic dishes. Don\u2019t use these items. Ceramics you buy in a store are generally safer than those made by craftspeople.\nSome arts and crafts supplies, including oil paints, ceramic glazes and stained glass materials. Use lead-free acrylic or watercolor paints during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nVinyl miniblinds imported from other countries.\nOld painted toys and some new toys and jewelry. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has information on recalls.\nCosmetics containing surma or kohl.\nLead solder in cans of food imported from other countries.\nSome candies imported from Mexico.\nCertain folk remedies for upset stomach, including those containing greta and azarcon.\nMany lipsticks contain traces of lead. A 2009 study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found small amounts of lead in all brands of lipstick tested. The FDA doesn\u2019t consider these lead levels to be a safety concern and didn\u2019t release the names of any of the lipstick brands. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics conducted a similar study in 2007. You can get more information from http://www.safecosmetics.org/ .\nIf you work in a field that puts you in contact with large amounts of lead on the job (such as painters, plumbers and those working in smelters, auto repair shops, battery manufacturing plants or certain types of construction), change your clothing (including shoes) and shower at work to avoid bringing lead into the home. Wash contaminated clothing at work or wash it at home separately from the rest of your family\u2019s clothing.\nDoes mercury exposure pose a risk in pregnancy?\nMercury is a metal that is found in the environment. Elemental (pure) mercury and methylmercury are two forms of mercury that may pose risks in pregnancy.\nElemental mercury is used in thermometers, dental fillings, fluorescent light bulbs and some batteries. Dental amalgam is a silver-colored material used to fill cavities in teeth. It contains elemental mercury, silver and other metals. Amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor that can be inhaled. The FDA considers amalgam safe in adults and children over age 6. However, there are few studies on the safety of amalgam in pregnant women and their babies. Some countries (Norway, Sweden and Denmark) recommend that dentists not use dental amalgam in pregnant women. If you\u2019re concerned about the use of amalgam, talk with your dentist.\nIf you work in a dental office or in an industry that uses mercury to make products (including electrical, chemical and mining industries), talk with your health care provider and take all recommended precautions.\nMethylmercury is formed when mercury in the air is deposited in water. The mercury comes from natural sources (such as volcanoes) and man-made sources (such as burning coal and other industrial pollution). Fish that swim in these waters often have methylmercury in their tissues. People come in contact with the mercury when they eat these fish. Eating fish is the main source of methylmercury exposure in humans.\nTrace amounts of mercury are present in many types of fish, but it\u2019s mostly found in certain large fish. For this reason, the FDA and the EPA advise pregnant women not to eat swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish.\nLimit of the amount albacore (white) tuna you eat to 6 ounces or less a week. All of these fish may contain enough mercury to harm your unborn baby's developing nervous system, sometimes leading to learning disabilities.\nWhat other metals pose a risk in pregnancy?\nArsenic may be harmful to pregnancy. It enters the environment through natural sources (weathering of rock and forest fires) and man-made sources (mining and electronics manufacturing).\nAlthough arsenic is a well-known poison, the small amounts normally found in the environment are unlikely to harm an unborn baby.\nHowever, you may come in contact with higher levels of arsenic that may pose an increased risk of pregnancy problems, including miscarriage and birth defects. Long-term exposure in children may result in lowered IQ. You may be exposed to higher levels of arsenic if you:\nWork or live near metal smelters.\nLive in agricultural areas where arsenic fertilizers (now banned in the United States) were used on crops.\nLive near hazardous waste sites or incinerators.\nDrink well water containing high levels of arsenic (this can occur in the places described above and in other areas, including parts of New England and the Midwest, that have naturally high levels of arsenic in rock).\nIf you live in areas that may have high arsenic levels, you can protect yourself by:\nLimiting contact with soil.\nGetting well water tested for arsenic to check if it\u2019s safe to drink or drinking bottled water.\nCommunity water suppliers already test for arsenic. The EPA has more information about testing water for arsenic.\nChecking decks and outdoor playsets made before 2003. Before that time, arsenic was used in these products. The EPA recommends applying a penetrating stain or sealant to these items once every year or two to reduce your chances of coming in contact with arsenic.\nChanging out of work clothing and shoes exposed to arsenic before going home.\nCan pesticides harm an unborn baby?\nThere is little proof that coming in contact with pest-control products (insecticides) at levels commonly used at home poses a risk to your unborn baby. However, all insecticides are to some extent poisonous. Some studies suggest that coming in contact with large amounts of pesticides may lead to miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight, birth defects and learning problems. If you do agricultural work or live in agricultural areas, you may be more likely to come in contact with high levels of pesticides than other women. Avoid pesticides whenever possible.\nYou can reduce your contact with pesticides by using alternatives like sticky traps. If your home or property needs pesticide treatment:\nHave someone else apply the chemicals. Leave the area for the amount of time listed on the package instructions.\nRemove food, dishes and utensils from the area before the pesticide is applied. Afterward, have someone open the windows and wash off all surfaces on which food is prepared.\nClose all windows and turn off air conditioning when pesticides are used outdoors. This helps keep fumes from coming into the house.\nWear rubber gloves when gardening to prevent skin contact with pesticides.\nYou may be concerned about the safety of insect repellants during pregnancy. The insect repellant , DEET (diethyltoluamide) is very effective at keeping insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, from biting. Preventing insect bites is important during pregnancy because infections from mosquitoes and ticks, such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease, may be harmful. The CDC doesn\u2019t recommend any special precautions for pregnant women using products with DEET if you follow label directions. Try to stay indoors during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most likely to bite, and wear long pants and long sleeves outside. Taking these precautions means you\u2019re less likely to need DEET.\nWhat are solvents?\nSolvents are chemicals that dissolve other substances. Solvents include alcohols, degreasers, paint thinners and stain and varnish removers. Lacquers, silk-screening inks and paints also contain these chemicals. A number of studies suggest that coming in contact with solvents at work may increase the risk of birth defects. A 1999 Canadian study found that women who were exposed to solvents on the job during their first trimester of pregnancy were 13 times more likely than unexposed women to have a baby with a major birth defect, like spina bifida (open spine), clubfoot, heart defects and deafness. The women in the study included factory workers, laboratory technicians, artists, graphic designers and printing industry workers.\nOther studies have found that women workers in semiconductor plants exposed to high levels of solvents called glycol ethers were more likely than unexposed women to miscarry. Glycol ethers also are used in jobs that involve photography, dyes and silkscreen printing.\nIf you work with solvents, even if you do arts and crafts at home, minimize your exposure by:\nMaking sure your workplace is well ventilated\nWearing appropriate protective clothing, including gloves and a face mask\nAvoiding meals or drinking in your work area\nTo learn more about the chemicals you work with, ask your employer for their safety information sheets. These sheets, made by chemical manufacturers, include information about possible dangers of specific chemicals and recommended safety tips for people who work with them. The MSDSSearch has a list of these sheets. You also can visit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health .\nCan air pollution harm an unborn baby?\nMost women who live in areas with higher-than-average levels of air pollution have healthy babies. However, studies from the United States and other countries suggest that if you come into contact with high levels of certain air pollutants, you may be slightly more likely than other women to have a premature or small baby. These air pollutants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and small particle pollution, both of which come from car exhaust and industrial sources. Another study suggests that children exposed to high PAH levels before birth may score more than 4 points lower on IQ tests than children exposed to lower levels.\nAir quality in many areas of the country has improved since the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. However, some pregnant women, including those living in large cities, are still exposed to unhealthy levels of pollution. You can avoid pollution by limiting outdoor activities, especially exercise, on days when there\u2019s poor air quality.\nDo household cleaning products pose a risk in pregnancy?\nAlthough some household cleansers contain solvents, there are many safe alternatives. Read labels carefully and don\u2019t use products (such as some oven cleaners) whose labels state that they are toxic.\nProducts that contain ammonia or chlorine are unlikely to harm your unborn baby, although their odors may cause you nausea. Open windows and doors and wear rubber gloves when using these products. Never mix ammonia and chlorine products because the combination produces fumes that are dangerous for anyone.\nIf you\u2019re worried about household cleansers or bothered by their odors, you can use safe, natural products instead. For example, use baking soda as a powdered cleanser to scrub greasy areas, pots and pans, sinks, tubs and ovens. You also can use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean many surfaces, such as countertops.\nDo chemicals in plastics pose a risk to the fetus or infant?\nPossibly. Plastics are made from a number of chemicals, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA). Phthalates make plastic soft and flexible. They are used in toys, medical devices (such as tubing), shampoos, cosmetics and food packaging. BPA makes plastics clear and strong. It is used in baby bottles, food containers (to line metal food cans) and water bottles.\nRecent research suggests that exposure to phthalates before birth may lead to subtle defects in male genitals. Phthalates also may pose a risk after birth. In 2006, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that one type of phthalate used in plastic medical tubing could pose a risk to the reproductive systems of baby boys. Many hospitals have removed such products from newborn nurseries. In 2008, the NTP also expressed concern about the effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. Other studies suggest that high BPA levels may play a role in some miscarriages.\nIn 2009, the United States banned the use of some phthalates from toys and child care articles, including any product children age 3 and younger use for sleeping, feeding, sucking or teething. Some manufacturers have discontinued use of BPA in baby bottles.\nStudies are continuing on possible health effects of these chemicals. Until there are better answers, you can take these steps to limit your exposure:\nDon\u2019t use plastic containers with the number 7 or the letters PC (polycarbonate) in the triangle found on the bottom.\nLimit use of canned food.\nDon\u2019t microwave food in plastic containers or put plastics in the dishwasher.\nYou can limit your baby\u2019s exposure by:\nBreastfeeding your baby so they don\u2019t have to use baby bottles.\nUsing baby bottles made of glass, polypropylene or polyethylene.\nGiving your baby plastic toys made after February 2009 or labeled phthalate-free.\nLimiting use of baby lotions or powders that contain phthalates.\nDoes the March of Dimes support research on environmental risks in pregnancy?\nThe March of Dimes has long supported studies working to find environmental factors that may pose a risk in pregnancy. One example is research on how coming in contact with estrogen-like chemicals in the environment effects an unborn baby. Other studies supported by the March of Dimes are working to better understand of how genes and environmental factors may interact and lead to birth defects and premature birth.\nApril 2011\n"}, {"score": 395.19913, "uuid": "a09d3a73-5382-5ba7-9393-7b8ed8a3c5c5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-57-01569", "target_hostname": "search.marchofdimes.com", "target_uri": "http://search.marchofdimes.com/pregnancy/stayingsafe_indepth.html", "page_rank": 1.2008031e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Environmental risks | Pregnancy | March <em>of</em> Dimes", "snippet": "Until there are <em>better</em> answers, you can take these steps to limit your exposure: * Don\u2019t use <em>plastic</em> containers with the number 7 <em>or</em> the letters PC (polycarbonate) <em>in</em> the triangle found on the bottom. * Don\u2019t microwave food <em>in</em> <em>plastic</em> containers <em>or</em> put <em>plastics</em> <em>in</em> the dishwasher. * Breastfeeding your", "explanation": null, "document": "Sign in or Sign up to save this page.\nYou've saved this page\nIt's been added to your dashboard\nRate this page\nSign in or Sign up to rate this page.\nHow helpful is this?\nClick on the stars below.\n4\nEnvironmental risks and pregnancy\nThere are more than 83,000 chemicals used in homes and businesses in this country, yet we have little information on how most of them may affect you and your baby during pregnancy.

However, we don\u2019t really know how most chemicals may affect your health. Talk to your health care provider about chemicals used in your workplace before pregnancy if possible. If you\u2019re thinking of getting pregnant, you may need extra protection at work or a change in your job duties to stay safe. This is especially important if you work in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, dry cleaning, printing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and health care. You also can take steps to protect yourself and your baby from pollutants and chemicals used at home.\nWhat are the risks of lead exposure during pregnancy?\nLead is a metal that was used for many years in gasoline and house paint. Although lead still can be found in the environment, the amounts have decreased greatly since the 1970s when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned its use in these products. Lead poses health risks for everyone, but young children and unborn babies are at greatest risk. If you come in contact with high levels of lead during pregnancy, your baby may be at risk for miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight and developmental delays.\nIf you live in an older home, you may be exposed to lead in deteriorating lead-based paint. Many homes built before 1978 were painted with lead-based paint. As long as paint is not crumbling or peeling, it poses little risk. However, crumbling paint can make lead dust when the surface is touched, especially when it is sanded or scraped.\nIf lead-based paint needs to be removed from your home, stay away until the removal is complete. Only experts should remove leaded paint. The EPA has information about lead and lead removal.\nYou also can be exposed to significant amounts of lead in drinking water if your home has lead pipes, lead solder on copper pipes or brass faucets. Contact your local health department or water supplier to find out how to get pipes tested for lead. If you use well water, have your water tested regularly for lead and other contaminants. The EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 has more information on home water testing.\nThe EPA recommends running water for 15 to 30 seconds before using it for drinking or cooking to help reduce lead levels. Water from the cold water pipe contains less lead than water from the hot pipe, so use cold water for drinking, cooking and preparing baby formula. Many home filters don\u2019t remove lead, so look for a filter that is certified by http://www.nsf.org/ to remove lead.\nOther possible sources of lead in the home include:\nLead crystal glassware and some ceramic dishes. Don\u2019t use these items. Ceramics you buy in a store are generally safer than those made by craftspeople.\nSome arts and crafts supplies, including oil paints, ceramic glazes and stained glass materials. Use lead-free acrylic or watercolor paints during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nVinyl miniblinds imported from other countries.\nOld painted toys and some new toys and jewelry. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has information on recalls.\nCosmetics containing surma or kohl.\nLead solder in cans of food imported from other countries.\nSome candies imported from Mexico.\nCertain folk remedies for upset stomach, including those containing greta and azarcon.\nMany lipsticks contain traces of lead. A 2009 study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found small amounts of lead in all brands of lipstick tested. The FDA doesn\u2019t consider these lead levels to be a safety concern and didn\u2019t release the names of any of the lipstick brands. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics conducted a similar study in 2007. You can get more information from http://www.safecosmetics.org/ .\nIf you work in a field that puts you in contact with large amounts of lead on the job (such as painters, plumbers and those working in smelters, auto repair shops, battery manufacturing plants or certain types of construction), change your clothing (including shoes) and shower at work to avoid bringing lead into the home. Wash contaminated clothing at work or wash it at home separately from the rest of your family\u2019s clothing.\nDoes mercury exposure pose a risk in pregnancy?\nMercury is a metal that is found in the environment. Elemental (pure) mercury and methylmercury are two forms of mercury that may pose risks in pregnancy.\nElemental mercury is used in thermometers, dental fillings, fluorescent light bulbs and some batteries. Dental amalgam is a silver-colored material used to fill cavities in teeth. It contains elemental mercury, silver and other metals. Amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor that can be inhaled. The FDA considers amalgam safe in adults and children over age 6. However, there are few studies on the safety of amalgam in pregnant women and their babies. Some countries (Norway, Sweden and Denmark) recommend that dentists not use dental amalgam in pregnant women. If you\u2019re concerned about the use of amalgam, talk with your dentist.\nIf you work in a dental office or in an industry that uses mercury to make products (including electrical, chemical and mining industries), talk with your health care provider and take all recommended precautions.\nMethylmercury is formed when mercury in the air is deposited in water. The mercury comes from natural sources (such as volcanoes) and man-made sources (such as burning coal and other industrial pollution). Fish that swim in these waters often have methylmercury in their tissues. People come in contact with the mercury when they eat these fish. Eating fish is the main source of methylmercury exposure in humans.\nTrace amounts of mercury are present in many types of fish, but it\u2019s mostly found in certain large fish. For this reason, the FDA and the EPA advise pregnant women not to eat swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish.\nLimit of the amount albacore (white) tuna you eat to 6 ounces or less a week. All of these fish may contain enough mercury to harm your unborn baby's developing nervous system, sometimes leading to learning disabilities.\nWhat other metals pose a risk in pregnancy?\nArsenic may be harmful to pregnancy. It enters the environment through natural sources (weathering of rock and forest fires) and man-made sources (mining and electronics manufacturing).\nAlthough arsenic is a well-known poison, the small amounts normally found in the environment are unlikely to harm an unborn baby.\nHowever, you may come in contact with higher levels of arsenic that may pose an increased risk of pregnancy problems, including miscarriage and birth defects. Long-term exposure in children may result in lowered IQ. You may be exposed to higher levels of arsenic if you:\nWork or live near metal smelters.\nLive in agricultural areas where arsenic fertilizers (now banned in the United States) were used on crops.\nLive near hazardous waste sites or incinerators.\nDrink well water containing high levels of arsenic (this can occur in the places described above and in other areas, including parts of New England and the Midwest, that have naturally high levels of arsenic in rock).\nIf you live in areas that may have high arsenic levels, you can protect yourself by:\nLimiting contact with soil.\nGetting well water tested for arsenic to check if it\u2019s safe to drink or drinking bottled water.\nCommunity water suppliers already test for arsenic. The EPA has more information about testing water for arsenic.\nChecking decks and outdoor playsets made before 2003. Before that time, arsenic was used in these products. The EPA recommends applying a penetrating stain or sealant to these items once every year or two to reduce your chances of coming in contact with arsenic.\nChanging out of work clothing and shoes exposed to arsenic before going home.\nCan pesticides harm an unborn baby?\nThere is little proof that coming in contact with pest-control products (insecticides) at levels commonly used at home poses a risk to your unborn baby. However, all insecticides are to some extent poisonous. Some studies suggest that coming in contact with large amounts of pesticides may lead to miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight, birth defects and learning problems. If you do agricultural work or live in agricultural areas, you may be more likely to come in contact with high levels of pesticides than other women. Avoid pesticides whenever possible.\nYou can reduce your contact with pesticides by using alternatives like sticky traps. If your home or property needs pesticide treatment:\nHave someone else apply the chemicals. Leave the area for the amount of time listed on the package instructions.\nRemove food, dishes and utensils from the area before the pesticide is applied. Afterward, have someone open the windows and wash off all surfaces on which food is prepared.\nClose all windows and turn off air conditioning when pesticides are used outdoors. This helps keep fumes from coming into the house.\nWear rubber gloves when gardening to prevent skin contact with pesticides.\nYou may be concerned about the safety of insect repellants during pregnancy. The insect repellant , DEET (diethyltoluamide) is very effective at keeping insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, from biting. Preventing insect bites is important during pregnancy because infections from mosquitoes and ticks, such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease, may be harmful. The CDC doesn\u2019t recommend any special precautions for pregnant women using products with DEET if you follow label directions. Try to stay indoors during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most likely to bite, and wear long pants and long sleeves outside. Taking these precautions means you\u2019re less likely to need DEET.\nWhat are solvents?\nSolvents are chemicals that dissolve other substances. Solvents include alcohols, degreasers, paint thinners and stain and varnish removers. Lacquers, silk-screening inks and paints also contain these chemicals. A number of studies suggest that coming in contact with solvents at work may increase the risk of birth defects. A 1999 Canadian study found that women who were exposed to solvents on the job during their first trimester of pregnancy were 13 times more likely than unexposed women to have a baby with a major birth defect, like spina bifida (open spine), clubfoot, heart defects and deafness. The women in the study included factory workers, laboratory technicians, artists, graphic designers and printing industry workers.\nOther studies have found that women workers in semiconductor plants exposed to high levels of solvents called glycol ethers were more likely than unexposed women to miscarry. Glycol ethers also are used in jobs that involve photography, dyes and silkscreen printing.\nIf you work with solvents, even if you do arts and crafts at home, minimize your exposure by:\nMaking sure your workplace is well ventilated\nWearing appropriate protective clothing, including gloves and a face mask\nAvoiding meals or drinking in your work area\nTo learn more about the chemicals you work with, ask your employer for their safety information sheets. These sheets, made by chemical manufacturers, include information about possible dangers of specific chemicals and recommended safety tips for people who work with them. The MSDSSearch has a list of these sheets. You also can visit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health .\nCan air pollution harm an unborn baby?\nMost women who live in areas with higher-than-average levels of air pollution have healthy babies. However, studies from the United States and other countries suggest that if you come into contact with high levels of certain air pollutants, you may be slightly more likely than other women to have a premature or small baby. These air pollutants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and small particle pollution, both of which come from car exhaust and industrial sources. Another study suggests that children exposed to high PAH levels before birth may score more than 4 points lower on IQ tests than children exposed to lower levels.\nAir quality in many areas of the country has improved since the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. However, some pregnant women, including those living in large cities, are still exposed to unhealthy levels of pollution. You can avoid pollution by limiting outdoor activities, especially exercise, on days when there\u2019s poor air quality.\nDo household cleaning products pose a risk in pregnancy?\nAlthough some household cleansers contain solvents, there are many safe alternatives. Read labels carefully and don\u2019t use products (such as some oven cleaners) whose labels state that they are toxic.\nProducts that contain ammonia or chlorine are unlikely to harm your unborn baby, although their odors may cause you nausea. Open windows and doors and wear rubber gloves when using these products. Never mix ammonia and chlorine products because the combination produces fumes that are dangerous for anyone.\nIf you\u2019re worried about household cleansers or bothered by their odors, you can use safe, natural products instead. For example, use baking soda as a powdered cleanser to scrub greasy areas, pots and pans, sinks, tubs and ovens. You also can use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean many surfaces, such as countertops.\nDo chemicals in plastics pose a risk to the fetus or infant?\nPossibly. Plastics are made from a number of chemicals, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA). Phthalates make plastic soft and flexible. They are used in toys, medical devices (such as tubing), shampoos, cosmetics and food packaging. BPA makes plastics clear and strong. It is used in baby bottles, food containers (to line metal food cans) and water bottles.\nRecent research suggests that exposure to phthalates before birth may lead to subtle defects in male genitals. Phthalates also may pose a risk after birth. In 2006, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that one type of phthalate used in plastic medical tubing could pose a risk to the reproductive systems of baby boys. Many hospitals have removed such products from newborn nurseries. In 2008, the NTP also expressed concern about the effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. Other studies suggest that high BPA levels may play a role in some miscarriages.\nIn 2009, the United States banned the use of some phthalates from toys and child care articles, including any product children age 3 and younger use for sleeping, feeding, sucking or teething. Some manufacturers have discontinued use of BPA in baby bottles.\nStudies are continuing on possible health effects of these chemicals. Until there are better answers, you can take these steps to limit your exposure:\nDon\u2019t use plastic containers with the number 7 or the letters PC (polycarbonate) in the triangle found on the bottom.\nLimit use of canned food.\nDon\u2019t microwave food in plastic containers or put plastics in the dishwasher.\nYou can limit your baby\u2019s exposure by:\nBreastfeeding your baby so they don\u2019t have to use baby bottles.\nUsing baby bottles made of glass, polypropylene or polyethylene.\nGiving your baby plastic toys made after February 2009 or labeled phthalate-free.\nLimiting use of baby lotions or powders that contain phthalates.\nDoes the March of Dimes support research on environmental risks in pregnancy?\nThe March of Dimes has long supported studies working to find environmental factors that may pose a risk in pregnancy. One example is research on how coming in contact with estrogen-like chemicals in the environment effects an unborn baby. Other studies supported by the March of Dimes are working to better understand of how genes and environmental factors may interact and lead to birth defects and premature birth.\nApril 2011\n"}, {"score": 395.18582, "uuid": "cf5d5690-63d9-517e-8360-d918f1c95026", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1016wb-13-21659", "target_hostname": "www.flowers-gardens.net", "target_uri": "http://www.flowers-gardens.net/flowers-during-vacation.html", "page_rank": 3.1514344e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "What to do with the flowers when we are going on vacation", "snippet": "If you leave your apartment for a week <em>or</em> two, take away your <em>plants</em> from the southern window sills, and place the <em>pots</em> <em>in</em> the bigger <em>pots</em> <em>or</em> containers and fill all the emptiness with damp sphagnum <em>or</em> peat. Plentifully water the <em>plants</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "What to do with the flowers when we are going on vacation?\nWhat to do with the flowers when we are going on vacation?\nSummer \u2013 is the time of holidays and labour feats in the garden . This is the time of transformation of flower beds , rock gardens, and hunting time for new plants\u2026 During this happy period we absolutely forget about the plants remained on the window sills. But if to take care about their destiny before your departure, it is possible to avoid many losses. So, what to do, if you are going to be absent more than a week and it was impossible to find compliant relatives or neighbours who would agree to take care of your flowers . In our disposal there are six ways of water delivery to plants.\nThe first way\nThe plants covered with a transparent polyethylene package evaporate much less moisture and\u00a0 can be left under such \"cap\" for a week. It is also noticed that even, as at full drying of a soil many plants, including gentle ferns, do not fade, being covered with this package. It is better for the package not to concern plants, i.e. it should be big enough big, and thin sticks-props will help to keep it on distance.\nThe second way\nIf you leave your apartment for a week or two, take away your plants from the southern window sills, and place the pots in the bigger pots or containers and fill all the emptiness with damp sphagnum or peat. Plentifully water the plants. Cover the surface of the substratum with a polyethylene package. So they can hold on without watering for some time. Tropical ferns and orchids can be transferred to the bathroom and placed on a lattice over the bathroom with water. They will sustain.\nThe third way\nIf your absence is longer than two weeks it is necessary to organise an automatic device for water delivery. For this purpose there are some schemes. Some of them you can make by yourself. For example, one end of a wick (old stockings, bandage, and other fabrics) is pushed by tweezers in the drainage aperture of the pot so that to touch the soil and the other end is placed into the capacity with water, placed under the pot. This capacity can be made of any suitable plastic container or a jar. It should be closed by cover with two holes, one for the wick, another for pouring water. This variant is compact, though the similar scheme can be incarnated in other type too. So, the wick can be put on the substratum, and its end immersed in the capacity with water which is placed above the object of watering.\nOn sale there are now wares with double bottom where the bottom part represents the tank for water. Cords connect water-supplies and substratum. As a whole this system functions by the similar capillary principle.\nThe fourth way\nIf the plants large enough or hygrophilous it is possible to place a two-liter large plastic bottle with the holes made in its bottom and cover\u00a0 \"headfirst\" in the earth to fill it with water. Such \"system\" will provide plants with water for a long time.\nThe fifth way\nThe modern and quite perfect system named \u00abtouch system of drop watering\u00bb. Of course you won\u2019t be able to make such system by yourself but in special stores it costs rather much but this system worth it. Its main element is a ceramic sensor control in the form of a carrot. It is filled with water and inserted into the soil. The soil dries up and the sensor control gives it water. When water-supplies in the sensor control come to end it automatically arrives from the tank through a rubber hose. This system is compact and looks very much civil (unlike the turned plastic bottle), and the main thing is that the plant does not suffer neither from lack of moisture, nor from its overabundance because surplus of a moisture is soaked up in the sensor control.\nAfter some time the calcium contained in tap water clogs up pores of the clay sensor control and it becomes water-proof. Usually its term of service is one season.\nThe sixth way\nThe most hi-tech and expensive way when plants are provided with drop watering, operated by timer. Such system in advance needs adjusting and connection to the water pipe. Necessarily test it before the departure. But with this system the plants should not be taken away from the window sills and it is possible to leave for a month or more. And it is only your choice.\nShare in:\n"}, {"score": 391.48553, "uuid": "b2a34d47-9c03-52e1-8a6a-c5c3868e5cf6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1104wb-22-02183", "target_hostname": "healthychild.org", "target_uri": "http://healthychild.org/live-healthy/faq/C345/", "page_rank": 1.4321067e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "FAQ | Healthy Child Healthy World", "snippet": "Traditionally, copper <em>pots</em> were lined with tin, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> a natural element <em>of</em> the earth and considered to be the most inert <em>of</em> metals.

Maybe Pyrex makes some? Assuming there are heat resistant glass mugs, are all glass mugs a safe option for coffee, tea soup etc. or do I need to know anything else about the glass before I buy? What about a glass kettle does one exist? Thanks again.\nANSWER:\nI consider all glass to be nontoxic, except for lead crystal, which contains lead that can leach into the beverage. Even colored glass is OK (see Q&A: Colored Glass ).\nDebra :)\nThis answer was provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd. Hailed as \"The Queen of Green\" by the New York Times, Debra Lynn Dadd has been a pioneering consumer advocate since 1982, specializing in products and lifestyle choices that are safer for human health and the environment. She is the author of Home Safe Home.\nI want to buy a clay cooker. What should I know about them?\nClay cookers are made from the abundant clay of the earth, use little energy while cooking, and can be broken up and returned to the earth at the end of their useful life.\nThere are two types of cookware made from clay:\n1. Traditional clay vessels have been used for cooking for millennia, and are still the most sustainable. You soak them in water before cooking, and the food gently steams as the hot moisture comes out of the clay. You can buy machine-made clay cookers such a Romertopf Clay Bakers at most major department stores and cooking stores. Handmade clay bread pans and muffin pans are often sold at craft fairs, so look around. If the clay has a glaze, make sure to check to be sure the glaze doesn't contain lead, particularly if the item is imported. I have a beautiful clay cooker called a tangine. It is a shallow, round earthenware pot with a lid like a pointed hat. I can just imagine women fashioning tangines with their hands from local mud and baking it in the sun to harden before cooking a stew for their families. Cooking in clay is literally \"earthy\" and primal. It's only appropriate for cooking slow and low, but the results are magnificent.\n2. There is also a new generation of ceramic cookware made from clay that brings this material into the 21st century. Modern technologies and high firing temperatures now make it possible to turn natural minerals and water into pots and pans that can be used for ordinary cooking. Xtrema cookware is the cookware I use everyday because it\nis completely nontoxic (no metals or plastics)\nis lightweight\nhas no odor nor taste\nholds heat well, saving energy while cooking\nis virtually non-stick\nis beautiful enough to be used for serving\nwill keep food hot during serving\nis completely non-porous, so it won't stain or hold food odors\nis bacteria resistant.\nhas a naturally low-stick surface.\nClay-based ceramics are also used for the new \"green\" nontoxic finishes. Cusinart's Green Gourmet line uses this nontoxic technology to create a slippery, glassy finish to which even eggs won't stick.\nIs it ok to buy used aluminum cookware?\nAluminum salts from cookware can leach from the pot into the food being cooked, particularly if it is acidic, causing a number of unpleasant symptoms.\nIf you buy used cookware at flea markets or thrift shops, check the label carefully and watch out for non-anodized aluminum. Non-anodized aluminum pots are usually heavy and look like they are pressed from a single piece of thick metal. The inside is the same color as the outside. Don't buy these.\nMost aluminum cookware manufactured today is anodized. When a cookware label says it is made from anodized aluminum, it means that the aluminum was dipped into a hot acid bath that seals the aluminum by changing it's molecular structure. Once anodized, the aluminum will not leach into food. If you are considering buying aluminum cookware, call the manufacturer and see if it has some recycled content.\nThere are some brands of cookware that use aluminum for the base of the pan because it distributes heat evenly and is relatively inexpensive, and then line the pan with stainless steel or some other finish. Cookware containing aluminum is safe to use only when the aluminum does not come in contact with the food, but those lined with stainless steel would have the same leaching problem as any stainless steel cookware.\nShould I buy pre-seasoned cast iron cookware?\nCast iron has been the mainstay cookware for generations. It's durable, inexpensive, and simple in materials, has even heating and good heat retention. But there is some controversy over the safety of the iron that may be released into the food. Some say it's a nutrient, or at least that it's harmless, others say the form of iron that is released is toxic. Regardless, it has been used for decades with no proven side effects.\nCast iron will tend to rust, so it needs to be \"seasoned\" with oil before it is used. If you buy new cast iron, don't buy \"preseasoned.\" Cast iron pans made in China are seasoned with paint that chips off into food. Stick with made-in-the-USA Lodge brand.\nDo copper pots and pans leach into food?\nCopper will leach into food if you cook in it directly, so most copper pots are lined (sugar pots for candymaking are not). Copper heats quickly and has very even heat distribution, so it is the choice of chefs everywhere.\nToday, most copper pots are lined with stainless steel, a manmade concoction of various metals which do not occur together in nature, and leach into food and water once the surface is scratched (see Stainless Steel above). Traditionally, copper pots were lined with tin, which is a natural element of the earth and considered to be the most inert of metals. Copper itself is also a naturally-occuring metal. Tin-lined copper pots are still available today in better cookware stores.\nHowever, after investing in two tin-lined copper pots, I found that the tin does come off. After purchase, I learned that these pots periodically need to be retinned. I damaged one of my pans by not washing it immediately, and the specks of food remaining in the pot after cooking ate right through the tin. These pots are beautiful and cook really well, but I now only use them for decoration.\nProfessionals prefer copper pots because they are the best at even heat distribution. If you want copper pots, get those lined with stainless steel and use wooden utensils to prevent scratching the stainless steel. I decided to not use copper pots because I didn't want stainless steel, they are very expensive, and very heavy. But they do cook really well.\nAre there any problems with using glass bakeware?\nGlass cook- and bake-ware is durable, inert, affordable and saves energy. Pyrex and Corning both make tempered glass cookware.\nThe downside to glass is that there have been many recent reports of both Pyrex and Visions shattering in the oven and stovetop. It may be that newer pieces are made differently. I personally have not had this problem, but all of my Pyrex and Visions are more than ten years old. Some of my Pyrex I inherited from my grandmothers.\nFrom a cooking viewpoint, glass is ideal. But there apparently are some safety issues.\nPyrex:\nThe most popular glass cookware and bakeware is Pyrex, which has been in use for almost a century. Made by Corning Glass Works, the \"low-expansion\" glass was originally developed in response to a request from the railroads to produce lantern glass that would not break when the hot glass was struck by rain or snow. The super-tough \"fire glass\" was not only resistant to temperature fluctuations, but also chemical corrosion and breakage as well.\nIn 1913, the wife of one of Corning's scientists used a new casserole dish only twice before it fractured in the oven. Having heard about the glass her husband worked with, she asked him to bring home a fire-glass container she could use for baking. She baked a sponge cake and found the cooking time was shorter, the cake did not stick to the glass, the baking was unusually uniform, the flavor of the cake did not remain in the dish after washing, and she could watch the cake bake and know it was done by looking at the underside. These features have made Pyrex glass a favorite among home cooks.\nAccording to their website, silica (a compound found in quartz and sand) is the main ingredient. \"Eight ingredients are added and some broken glass\" and all are cooked in a huge furnace at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. So while it doesn't contain recycled glass bottles, broken glass within the factory is recycled back into the pot. Pyrex is durable (so it can be reused for years without breaking or chipping) and it saves energy (Pyrex glass absorbs, rather than reflecting oven heat waves, thereby reducing cooking time over earthenware, porcelain or enameled dishes).\nPyrex is completely inert and does not leach anything into the food being cooked, you can bake and serve in the same dish, and then put it in the refrigerator and freezer.\nPyrex is affordable, comes in many sizes and shapes, and is sold everywhere.\nCorning also makes tempered-glass Visions pots (made from a proprietary blend of glass and ceramic). Corning Visions is sold on the internet and is available used on eBay and can often be found in thrift stores and flea markets.\nMy nonstick pan is so easy to cook with, but I've heard some bad things about the coating. Is there anything to be worried about?\nThe problem with most non-stick finishes (such as Teflon) is that they are made from plastics that are simply a coating on an aluminum pan, so they chip and scratch easily and can contaminate your food. There is a new type, however, which locks the non-stick plastic finish into a crater-like material made from indestructable ceramic and titanium. Embedding the finish in the ceramic-titanium craters prevents it from being scraped off into the food, but fumes may still be released, especially as a result of long periods of excessive heat.\nA recent investigation by the Environmental Working Group found that an independent science panel advised the EPA that Teflon is a \"likely human carcinogen.\" The report says there is evidence that the manufacturer Dupont knew that Teflon was toxic, that it entered the bloodstream of people who used it, and that it is very persistent in the environment. Dupont is also undergoing a federal criminal investigation for allegedly suppressing studies regarding birth defects and other health hazards from Teflon.\nPorcelain enamel finishes are completely inert and safe to use, but they also chip easily.\nIf you want to prevent your food from sticking in any kind of pan, heat up the pan first, then add your oil to the hot pan, and let the oil warm up before you put in the food. It won't stick.\nAre silicone baking mats a good alternative to parchment paper?\nI personally use silicone spatulas and baking mats and have experienced no ill effects. Nothing sticks to them and they are very easy to clean. My silicone baking mats (which can be reused more than 2000 times) have already saved yards and yards of parchment paper!\nSilicone is now being used to make a whole variety of useful non-stick cooking items. They are bright and colorful and easy to store. While there are no stovetop pots and pans, there are hundreds of useful kitchen items, including baking pans, baking sheets, spatulas, molds, ice cube trays in fun shapes (that also can double for baking little cakes), rolling pins, and more.\nSilicone is a synthetic polymer made from silica and other ingredients.\nSilica is common sand, made up of silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth's crust (about 28%).\nSilicon is not found in its elemental form but occurs mainly as oxides and silicates, like sand.\nSilicones are made chemically by creating a \"backbone\" of silicon and oxygen molecules, a combination that does not occur in nature.\nVarious other synthetic molecules are added, branching off of the main silicon-oxygen line to create hundreds of different silicones that range from liquids to rubbery solids.\nI tried to find some information on the health effects of silicone rubber, but it was not listed in any of the toxic chemical databases I use. I went to the Dow Corning website (who makes over 700 different silicone rubbers) and looked at a random sample of their MSDSs. The ones I read listed no hazardous materials or health effects, or needed first aid measures. All descriptions I read of silicone rubber describe it as chemically inert and stable, so it is unlikely to react with or leach into food, nor outgas vapors. MSDSs also note that silicone is not toxic to aquatic or soil organisms, it is not hazardous waste, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled after a lifetime of use.\nSilicone has many desirable benefits:\ninherently nonstick without an added finish\ndoes not retain odors or flavors\nstain resistant\ndishwasher safe\ncan go from temperature extremes of -58 degrees F up to 428 degrees F, from freezer to oven [note home ovens can go up to 500 degrees F, so keep the 428 degree F limit in mind]\npromotes even heat distribution\nquick cooling\nsome items can be folded for easy storage\nAll that said, some users have reported concerns about colorants used in the brightly colored pieces, and odors during use\nWhat do you think about cookware made of Soapstone?\nLike ceramic cookware, soapstone has many desirable qualities for cookware:\nlong lasting\nholds heat for long periods\nvirtually non-stick\nbeautiful enough to be used for serving\nwill keep food hot during serving\ncompletely non-porous, so it won't stain or hold food odors\nbacteria resistant.\nSoapstone cookware is heavy, thick, and somewhat expensive, but it is an excellent conductor of heat. I am amazed at how quickly it will boil water, even at medium low heat. Soapstone cookware is energy-saving and will last several lifetimes, so it can be handed down from generation to generation. I use my soapstone pots for soups and stews because they seem to impart and earthy essence to the food.\nSoapstone is a quarried stone like granite and marble. Its primary components are magnesite, dolomite, chlorite, and talc. The talc gives it the smooth feeling of rubbing a piece of dry soap--thus the name \"soapstone.\"\nBecause it can be easily cut to shape without special stone cutting tools, soapstone has been used for thousands of years throughout the world for tools, karafes, vases, goblets, sinks, and other useful household objects.\nThe major difference between ceramic and soapstone is that ceramic is lightweight and soapstone is very heavy. Even though soapstone has no taste, it is a rock and is not completely neutral. It does \"add something\" to the character of the food. Foods cook quite differently in soapstone and ceramic than in metal cookware, each unique.\nI use stainless steel pans, should I be worried about leaching?\nStainless steel is generally considered the best choice for cooking because it is sanitary, nonporous, and the metals are highly stable. Environmentally, however, the mining and manufacture of steel is a highly technological, energy-intensive and polluting process. Stainless steel also leaches nickel and chromium into food, which may be harmful to health.\nIf you choose stainless steel for it's advantages, then buy an energy-efficient brand to balance out some of the environmental disadvantages. This type of stainless steel cookware generally has double-walled sides and insulated lids allow you to slow-cook at lower temperatures and save a substantial amount of energy. In addition, because the pots retain heat, foods will continue to cook even after the pot is removed from the burner.\nYou can minimize the leaching of metals by only using wooden utensils in stainless steel pots and pans. Metal utensils scratch the surface and release more metals.\nThese answers were provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

I have an assorted collection of dishware and glassware that includes clear glass, handmade pottery, recycled glass, and an old set of Wedgewood china that was given to me as a gift.\nAside from plastic--which is obviously identifiable--the most important thing to watch out for is the lead used in glazes. And it's not just brightly colored dishware from other countries that is a problem--most major manufacturers of dinnerware sold in department stores and home-decorating shops still use lead glazes, without labeling them as such. The federal government prohibits the sale of dinnerware that releases lead in amounts greater than 2,000 ppb which prevents direct cases of lead poisoning, but the state of California requires warning labels on any dishware that releases lead in amounts greater than 224 ppb, to protect against long-term health risks.\nI like to purchase dishware from local potters. Many now use lead-free glazes and you can ask them directly if lead-free glaze was used.\nThe other option is to test a sample of the dishware with a home lead-testing swabs . That way you know for sure.\nI've listed some links to websites with safe dinnerware on Debra's List .\nAnd here is a link with a long list of dinnerware brands that meet the California standards . Remember these are not necessarily lead-free, but rather those that meet the California standards.\nEnvironmental Defense has an excellent article on lead in dinnerware that includes phone numbers for some major manufacturers that can tell you about the glazes used on specific patterns.

The same amount of regular black tea has 40-120 milligrams and decaf has 2-10).\nNow, to the essence of the question: does decaf coffee/tea have bad chemicals in it from the decaffeinating process?\nQuick Answer: Potentially.\nCurrently, there are three main processes used for decaffeination:\nDirect Solvent Method\nCO2\nWater Processing\n1 - Direct solvent method: - a technique that uses methylene chloride (which the FDA banned in hairsprays and cosmetics due to inhalation risks), coffee oil, or ethyl acetate (a low-toxicity solvent naturally present in wines) to dissolve the caffeine and extract it from the coffee.\nClearly, the process using methylene chloride is the one that has stirred public panic about decaf coffee. Still, according to Methylene chloride decaffeination: bad process: or bad press? by Shea Sturdivant in the Tea & Coffee Trade Journal, only minute traces of the chemical are left after the process is complete. \"Methylene chloride evaporates at 100 to 200 [degrees] F; beans are usually roasted at temperature of 350 to 425 [degrees] F, and coffee is brewed at 190 to 212 [degrees] F. Any amounts of methylene chloride left in brewed coffee would be less than one part per million.\"\nAlso, \"According to a report published on August 9, 1985, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, studies of rats fed regular and decaffeinated coffee (at doses equivalent to 70 or 80 cups of coffee per day) or fed methylene chloride in their drinking water (at doses equivalent to 125,000 to 6,250,000 cups of decaffeinated coffee per day) showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. . . . Hence, scientific evidence suggests that methylene chloride is safe for use as a solvent in decaffeinating coffee.\"\nBut, as proponents of being safe rather than sorry - especially during pregnancy - you may want to avoid beverages that have been decaffeinated using this method. And, thinking big picture - the workers in charge of this method are at a much higher risk - so you should consider avoiding it to support worker health.\n2 - CO2: (technically known as supercritical fluid extraction) uses a pressurized method with a water or charcoal filtration to remove the caffeine.\n3 - Water processing (also known as the Swiss Water Process) simply uses water and a carbon filtration system to remove the caffeine.\nCO2 and water processing are safer options since they do not utilize hazardous solvents, but the direct solvent method is preferred by manufacturers because it's the most affordable and has the capacity to remove the highest percentage of caffeine.\nThis answer was provided by our fabulous Chief Communications Officer, Janelle .

Let us know!\nHow Can I Avoid Genetically Modified Foods?\nQUESTION:\nI'm on a kick to boycott all GMOs [genetically modified organisms] because I don't want to support environmentally toxic agricultural policies. But how do I know for sure that the food I'm buying doesn't somehow contain genetically modified ingredients?\n-Mary\nANSWER:\nThis week's headline-grabbing news that agriculture giant Monsanto's genetically modified corn was found to cause organ failure in rats is sure to send panicked shoppers into an anti-frankenfood frenzy. The good news is that this is precisely the kind of damning study (GM corn + animals = death) that will help bring to light the potentially catastrophic consequences of scientifically altered crops. The bad news is that even those who see that light will have a difficult time completely boycotting genetically modified organisms , or GMOs as they've come to be known.\nThat's because GMOs aren't just limited to the foods we eat; they're also in the clothes we wear (cotton is one of the most prevalent GMO crops) and in the everyday household products we use. Those who buy giant jugs of distilled white vinegar to make DIY eco-friendly cleaning products might be interested to know that their vinegar may, in fact, be distilled from GMO corn. I say may, because if you live in the United States, there's no proof that the products you buy or the food you serve your children hasn't been genetically tampered with. While the EU, Japan, China, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand have labeling laws for GMO foods, there are no such requirements in the US, despite the fact that a 2008 CBS News poll found that an overwhelming 87 percent of Americans would like GMO foods to be labeled.\nAs usual, lawmakers are light-years behind the American consumer. And with a GM crop pioneer now firmly planted in the Obama administration as director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, I'm not holding my breath for GMO crops to be restricted in the US anytime soon. Here's how you can take charge in the meantime:\nBuy organic. Organic foods must be processed without bioengineering, but look for labels saying either 95 or 100 percent organic as anything less could still include GMO ingredients. And if you can't afford to buy everything organic, at least make sure that the animal products you purchase -- meat, dairy, eggs -- are. With conventional beef, for instance, you can be pretty sure that mountains of Roundup Ready corn were fed to those cows. That conventional zucchini? Not as looming a threat, at least where GMOs are concerned.\nBeware the SCCC. No, it's not some new government agency (though maybe it should be). That stands for soy, cotton, canola, and corn, which are among the most common GMO crops. The statistics are startling: 91 percent of soy, 87 percent of cotton, 75 percent of canola, and 73 percent of corn crops grown in the US are GMO, according to the USDA. So unless the label specifically says organic, you can pretty much bet that any food or product you buy that contains any of the big four have been genetically changed. We're not just talking tofu and tortilla chips, either: It's the sheets on your bed, those potato chips fried in cottonseed oil, and the aspartame in your Diet Coke (made using a fermentation process that involves soy and corn).\nAvoid processed, packaged foods. Thanks to farming subsidies that have produced unimaginable surpluses of cheap (mostly GMO) corn, we now have dozens of corn-based ingredients served up to us in increasingly creative ways by the processed food industry. As Michael Pollan points out in The Omnivore's Dilemma, \"Corn is in the coffee whitener and Cheez Whiz, the frozen yogurt and TV dinner, the canned fruit and ketchup and candies, the soups and snacks and cake mixes...there are some 45,000 items in the average American supermarket and more than a quarter of them now contain corn.\" Bottom line: If you're concerned about GMOs, don't eat anything with an advertising budget .\nCheck out the Non-GMO Shopping Guide . The site just launched last month, and offers more tips on how to avoid GMOs. The guide also includes lists of common name-brand foods that may contain them, as well as ones that are GMO-free.\nFinally, the most important thing you can do, beyond voting with your dollars: Call your Congressperson to say that you want to see mandatory GMO labeling laws. If the jury is still out as to whether GMOs cause organ failure, then we shouldn't have to play this guessing game every time we go to the supermarket.\nThis piece, by Jennifer Grayson , originally appeared in Huffington Post .

I had a little garden growing in my kitchen and the fruit flies moved in with my kale and broccoli. I've gotten rid of the plants but the flies are still here. Any suggestions?\nANSWER:\nFruit flies are a real nuisance, but they\u2019re easy enough to get rid of using non-toxic solutions. Here are some methods to try:\nPour a little sweet cheap white wine (Riesling) in a glass and add a drop of a natural soap to break the surface tension. Place near infected area. The fruit flies will drown trying to drink the wine.\nPour some apple cider vinegar into a glass, and place a paper funnel over the container. Fruit flies are attracted to the smell and fly into the glass, but 4 out of 5 can\u2019t find the way back out.\nMix some basil oil with water and spray your kitchen. Fruit flies are repelled by the smell of basil.\nThis answer was provided by our fabulous Senior Editor, Janelle . See all of our questions and answers at Get Answers . Do you have a question? Let us know!\nI can\u2019t go organic with everything. Are there some foods that matter more?\nYes! If you can\u2019t make the switch fully, there are definitely some products that are more dangerous than others. Sometimes referred to as the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d the following produce are especially important to go organic with: peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, imported grapes, spinach, pears, lettuce, and potatoes. By switching to organic for only these items, you can eliminate exposure to about 15 different pesticides!\nAnimal products ranging from meat to dairy are always important to eat organic. Conventional products can contain hormones used for growth, antibiotics used to prevent disease, chemical and toxins in pesticides and more. Learn more about going organic!\nThe \u201cConsistently Clean\u201d list identifies products that are generally tested to be free of pesticides and includes: onions, avocados, sweet corn, papaya, mango, pineapple, asparagus, kiwi, broccoli, cabbage and sweet peas. These products are less important to buy organic. Visit the Environmental Working Group\u2019s website for more detailed information.\nI want to buy organic foods, but they are just too expensive! What can I do?\nDon\u2019t get discouraged! There are less expensive ways to buy organic foods.\nIn general organic food does cost more. Organic produce costs about 20% more than its conventionally grown counterpart and organic meats can cost up to 3 times as much. There are strategies you can use to find healthy, organic foods that fit your budget.\nLook for sales at your local grocery stores. Buying in bulk for foods with a long shelf life will shave a ton off of the price. Also, always try to buy locally, seasonally, and from the source. Farmer\u2019s markets are a great way to find less expensive safe, natural foods while supporting local growers. Since you are buying directly from the producer and close to home, it will often cost less. Additionally, foods that are out of season locally can be more expensive because of the oil used to transport the food over great distances.\nLearn more about a cost-effective organic lifestyle.\nIs there Lead in my reverse osmosis spigot?\nQUESTION:\nWe have well water with a reverse osmosis (RO) unit under our kitchen sink. I recently met a man who was working with the laws for testing lead in Nebraska. He said that currently there are problems with many of the spigots leaching large amounts of lead into the RO water. He is trying to change the testing procedures to just test the first small amount of water that is drawn from the spigot first thing in the morning rather than the normal testing of one liter of water. He is worried that the one-liter testing is diluting the lead levels and not looking at real life use\u2014filling up small glass of water for your child. He also said that the original spigots that come with the RO unit are not as bad; however, the replacement spigots that are often used to match other colors of kitchen faucets are sometimes showing up to ten times the allowable limit of lead. Our spigot is a replacement so I am really worried. I have contacted a state authorized lab for lead testing in water and we will be testing our RO water (both a small and one liter sample size for testing). I'm just wondering if others have heard anything about this? Does anyone know of a source for spigots that are lead free and safe from other contaminates, preferably manufactured in the USA?\nThanks!\nANSWER:\nI wrote a post a couple of years ago about Lead-Free Water Faucets . I don't know what the regulations are for replacement spigots, but the lead issues may be similar.\nI suggest that you test the water coming out of your R/O unit for lead to be sure.\nDebra\nThis answer was provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

Are there any alternatives to these kinds of products that don't use PVC? What kinds of plastics are safer?\nNo, not all plastic wraps, baggies, etc. are made of PVC plastic. In general, the commercial wraps (used in delis or supermarkets) are the ones most likely to be made from PVC. There are other wraps made from safer plastics available. There are also plastic containers that are safer .

It says right on the label that it is made only from natural oils and beeswax. I even called the company, who assured me it was \"all-natural\". \u2028\u2028We've been using it on our wooden salad bowls and cutting boards since I found it in a fancy San Francisco cooking store years ago. Just recently, we used it to finish the wooden top on a kitchen island we built. It really protects the wood - water beads right up and we felt good having the beeswax around our organic food. It has no odor, except for the slight sweetness of beeswax.\nThe Holland Bowl Mill website says it has received many letters from customers telling them B's Oil is so gentle that they use it as their favorite hand cream moisturizer. \u2028\u2028So I was surprised to find out that it is actually made from beeswax and mineral oil! I had a long phone conversation with the owner and made sure he understood that you cannot label a product containing mineral oil as natural. I see he has changed the description on his website after our conversation.\nI set out to find a truly all-natural wood conditioner for my wooden salad bowls and cutting boards, and discovered some interesting things even many woodworkers don't know. \u2028\u2028It is important to apply some kind of protection to wood cutting boards and bowls before using them the first time, to prevent staining and absorption of food odors and bacteria, and to keep water from penetrating the wood, which results in warping and cracking.\nSome suggest \"seasoning\" the wood with oil, just as you would a cast-iron pan. Warm the oil slightly, and apply in the direction of the grain, allowing it to soak in between each coat. Apply four or five coats of oil. Wait about four to six hours between coats, and wipe off any excess oil that did not soak in before applying the next coat of warm oil.\nDebra :-)\nThis answer was provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as well as in the cell walls of diatoms (as in diatomaceous earth. It is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust.\nSilica is used primarily in the production of window glass, drinking glasses and bottled beverages, as well as optical fibers for telecommunications. It is a primary raw material for many ceramics including earthenware, stoneware and porcelain, and industrial Portland cement. \u2028\u2028Silica is common additive in food products, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to absorb water.\nI know of no harmful effects from digesting silica in foods or supplements. In fact, it is sold as a mineral supplement.\nSilicosis is a disabling, nonreversible and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by overexposure to breathing large amounts of crystalline silica, such as amounts you would be exposed to in workplace exposures.\nIt is not toxic, it is a particle hazard.

What should I know about them?\nClay cookers are made from the abundant clay of the earth, use little energy while cooking, and can be broken up and returned to the earth at the end of their useful life.\nThere are two types of cookware made from clay:\n1. Traditional clay vessels have been used for cooking for millennia, and are still the most sustainable. You soak them in water before cooking, and the food gently steams as the hot moisture comes out of the clay. You can buy machine-made clay cookers such a Romertopf Clay Bakers at most major department stores and cooking stores. Handmade clay bread pans and muffin pans are often sold at craft fairs, so look around. If the clay has a glaze, make sure to check to be sure the glaze doesn't contain lead, particularly if the item is imported. I have a beautiful clay cooker called a tangine. It is a shallow, round earthenware pot with a lid like a pointed hat. I can just imagine women fashioning tangines with their hands from local mud and baking it in the sun to harden before cooking a stew for their families. Cooking in clay is literally \"earthy\" and primal. It's only appropriate for cooking slow and low, but the results are magnificent.\n2. There is also a new generation of ceramic cookware made from clay that brings this material into the 21st century. Modern technologies and high firing temperatures now make it possible to turn natural minerals and water into pots and pans that can be used for ordinary cooking. Xtrema cookware is the cookware I use everyday because it\nis completely nontoxic (no metals or plastics)\nis lightweight\nhas no odor nor taste\nholds heat well, saving energy while cooking\nis virtually non-stick\nis beautiful enough to be used for serving\nwill keep food hot during serving\nis completely non-porous, so it won't stain or hold food odors\nis bacteria resistant.\nhas a naturally low-stick surface.\nClay-based ceramics are also used for the new \"green\" nontoxic finishes. Cusinart's Green Gourmet line uses this nontoxic technology to create a slippery, glassy finish to which even eggs won't stick.\nIs it ok to buy used aluminum cookware?\nAluminum salts from cookware can leach from the pot into the food being cooked, particularly if it is acidic, causing a number of unpleasant symptoms.\nIf you buy used cookware at flea markets or thrift shops, check the label carefully and watch out for non-anodized aluminum. Non-anodized aluminum pots are usually heavy and look like they are pressed from a single piece of thick metal. The inside is the same color as the outside. Don't buy these.\nMost aluminum cookware manufactured today is anodized. When a cookware label says it is made from anodized aluminum, it means that the aluminum was dipped into a hot acid bath that seals the aluminum by changing it's molecular structure. Once anodized, the aluminum will not leach into food. If you are considering buying aluminum cookware, call the manufacturer and see if it has some recycled content.\nThere are some brands of cookware that use aluminum for the base of the pan because it distributes heat evenly and is relatively inexpensive, and then line the pan with stainless steel or some other finish. Cookware containing aluminum is safe to use only when the aluminum does not come in contact with the food, but those lined with stainless steel would have the same leaching problem as any stainless steel cookware.\nShould I buy pre-seasoned cast iron cookware?\nCast iron has been the mainstay cookware for generations. It's durable, inexpensive, and simple in materials, has even heating and good heat retention. But there is some controversy over the safety of the iron that may be released into the food. Some say it's a nutrient, or at least that it's harmless, others say the form of iron that is released is toxic. Regardless, it has been used for decades with no proven side effects.\nCast iron will tend to rust, so it needs to be \"seasoned\" with oil before it is used. If you buy new cast iron, don't buy \"preseasoned.\" Cast iron pans made in China are seasoned with paint that chips off into food. Stick with made-in-the-USA Lodge brand.\nDo copper pots and pans leach into food?\nCopper will leach into food if you cook in it directly, so most copper pots are lined (sugar pots for candymaking are not). Copper heats quickly and has very even heat distribution, so it is the choice of chefs everywhere.\nToday, most copper pots are lined with stainless steel, a manmade concoction of various metals which do not occur together in nature, and leach into food and water once the surface is scratched (see Stainless Steel above). Traditionally, copper pots were lined with tin, which is a natural element of the earth and considered to be the most inert of metals. Copper itself is also a naturally-occuring metal. Tin-lined copper pots are still available today in better cookware stores.\nHowever, after investing in two tin-lined copper pots, I found that the tin does come off. After purchase, I learned that these pots periodically need to be retinned. I damaged one of my pans by not washing it immediately, and the specks of food remaining in the pot after cooking ate right through the tin. These pots are beautiful and cook really well, but I now only use them for decoration.\nProfessionals prefer copper pots because they are the best at even heat distribution. If you want copper pots, get those lined with stainless steel and use wooden utensils to prevent scratching the stainless steel. I decided to not use copper pots because I didn't want stainless steel, they are very expensive, and very heavy. But they do cook really well.\nAre there any problems with using glass bakeware?\nGlass cook- and bake-ware is durable, inert, affordable and saves energy. Pyrex and Corning both make tempered glass cookware.\nThe downside to glass is that there have been many recent reports of both Pyrex and Visions shattering in the oven and stovetop. It may be that newer pieces are made differently. I personally have not had this problem, but all of my Pyrex and Visions are more than ten years old. Some of my Pyrex I inherited from my grandmothers.\nFrom a cooking viewpoint, glass is ideal. But there apparently are some safety issues.\nPyrex:\nThe most popular glass cookware and bakeware is Pyrex, which has been in use for almost a century. Made by Corning Glass Works, the \"low-expansion\" glass was originally developed in response to a request from the railroads to produce lantern glass that would not break when the hot glass was struck by rain or snow. The super-tough \"fire glass\" was not only resistant to temperature fluctuations, but also chemical corrosion and breakage as well.\nIn 1913, the wife of one of Corning's scientists used a new casserole dish only twice before it fractured in the oven. Having heard about the glass her husband worked with, she asked him to bring home a fire-glass container she could use for baking. She baked a sponge cake and found the cooking time was shorter, the cake did not stick to the glass, the baking was unusually uniform, the flavor of the cake did not remain in the dish after washing, and she could watch the cake bake and know it was done by looking at the underside. These features have made Pyrex glass a favorite among home cooks.\nAccording to their website, silica (a compound found in quartz and sand) is the main ingredient. \"Eight ingredients are added and some broken glass\" and all are cooked in a huge furnace at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. So while it doesn't contain recycled glass bottles, broken glass within the factory is recycled back into the pot. Pyrex is durable (so it can be reused for years without breaking or chipping) and it saves energy (Pyrex glass absorbs, rather than reflecting oven heat waves, thereby reducing cooking time over earthenware, porcelain or enameled dishes).\nPyrex is completely inert and does not leach anything into the food being cooked, you can bake and serve in the same dish, and then put it in the refrigerator and freezer.\nPyrex is affordable, comes in many sizes and shapes, and is sold everywhere.\nCorning also makes tempered-glass Visions pots (made from a proprietary blend of glass and ceramic). Corning Visions is sold on the internet and is available used on eBay and can often be found in thrift stores and flea markets.\nMy nonstick pan is so easy to cook with, but I've heard some bad things about the coating. Is there anything to be worried about?\nThe problem with most non-stick finishes (such as Teflon) is that they are made from plastics that are simply a coating on an aluminum pan, so they chip and scratch easily and can contaminate your food. There is a new type, however, which locks the non-stick plastic finish into a crater-like material made from indestructable ceramic and titanium. Embedding the finish in the ceramic-titanium craters prevents it from being scraped off into the food, but fumes may still be released, especially as a result of long periods of excessive heat.\nA recent investigation by the Environmental Working Group found that an independent science panel advised the EPA that Teflon is a \"likely human carcinogen.\" The report says there is evidence that the manufacturer Dupont knew that Teflon was toxic, that it entered the bloodstream of people who used it, and that it is very persistent in the environment. Dupont is also undergoing a federal criminal investigation for allegedly suppressing studies regarding birth defects and other health hazards from Teflon.\nPorcelain enamel finishes are completely inert and safe to use, but they also chip easily.\nIf you want to prevent your food from sticking in any kind of pan, heat up the pan first, then add your oil to the hot pan, and let the oil warm up before you put in the food. It won't stick.\nAre silicone baking mats a good alternative to parchment paper?\nI personally use silicone spatulas and baking mats and have experienced no ill effects. Nothing sticks to them and they are very easy to clean. My silicone baking mats (which can be reused more than 2000 times) have already saved yards and yards of parchment paper!\nSilicone is now being used to make a whole variety of useful non-stick cooking items. They are bright and colorful and easy to store. While there are no stovetop pots and pans, there are hundreds of useful kitchen items, including baking pans, baking sheets, spatulas, molds, ice cube trays in fun shapes (that also can double for baking little cakes), rolling pins, and more.\nSilicone is a synthetic polymer made from silica and other ingredients.\nSilica is common sand, made up of silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth's crust (about 28%).\nSilicon is not found in its elemental form but occurs mainly as oxides and silicates, like sand.\nSilicones are made chemically by creating a \"backbone\" of silicon and oxygen molecules, a combination that does not occur in nature.\nVarious other synthetic molecules are added, branching off of the main silicon-oxygen line to create hundreds of different silicones that range from liquids to rubbery solids.\nI tried to find some information on the health effects of silicone rubber, but it was not listed in any of the toxic chemical databases I use. I went to the Dow Corning website (who makes over 700 different silicone rubbers) and looked at a random sample of their MSDSs. The ones I read listed no hazardous materials or health effects, or needed first aid measures. All descriptions I read of silicone rubber describe it as chemically inert and stable, so it is unlikely to react with or leach into food, nor outgas vapors. MSDSs also note that silicone is not toxic to aquatic or soil organisms, it is not hazardous waste, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled after a lifetime of use.\nSilicone has many desirable benefits:\ninherently nonstick without an added finish\ndoes not retain odors or flavors\nstain resistant\ndishwasher safe\ncan go from temperature extremes of -58 degrees F up to 428 degrees F, from freezer to oven [note home ovens can go up to 500 degrees F, so keep the 428 degree F limit in mind]\npromotes even heat distribution\nquick cooling\nsome items can be folded for easy storage\nAll that said, some users have reported concerns about colorants used in the brightly colored pieces, and odors during use\nWhat do you think about cookware made of Soapstone?\nLike ceramic cookware, soapstone has many desirable qualities for cookware:\nlong lasting\nholds heat for long periods\nvirtually non-stick\nbeautiful enough to be used for serving\nwill keep food hot during serving\ncompletely non-porous, so it won't stain or hold food odors\nbacteria resistant.\nSoapstone cookware is heavy, thick, and somewhat expensive, but it is an excellent conductor of heat. I am amazed at how quickly it will boil water, even at medium low heat. Soapstone cookware is energy-saving and will last several lifetimes, so it can be handed down from generation to generation. I use my soapstone pots for soups and stews because they seem to impart and earthy essence to the food.\nSoapstone is a quarried stone like granite and marble. Its primary components are magnesite, dolomite, chlorite, and talc. The talc gives it the smooth feeling of rubbing a piece of dry soap--thus the name \"soapstone.\"\nBecause it can be easily cut to shape without special stone cutting tools, soapstone has been used for thousands of years throughout the world for tools, karafes, vases, goblets, sinks, and other useful household objects.\nThe major difference between ceramic and soapstone is that ceramic is lightweight and soapstone is very heavy. Even though soapstone has no taste, it is a rock and is not completely neutral. It does \"add something\" to the character of the food. Foods cook quite differently in soapstone and ceramic than in metal cookware, each unique.\nI use stainless steel pans, should I be worried about leaching?\nStainless steel is generally considered the best choice for cooking because it is sanitary, nonporous, and the metals are highly stable. Environmentally, however, the mining and manufacture of steel is a highly technological, energy-intensive and polluting process. Stainless steel also leaches nickel and chromium into food, which may be harmful to health.\nIf you choose stainless steel for it's advantages, then buy an energy-efficient brand to balance out some of the environmental disadvantages. This type of stainless steel cookware generally has double-walled sides and insulated lids allow you to slow-cook at lower temperatures and save a substantial amount of energy. In addition, because the pots retain heat, foods will continue to cook even after the pot is removed from the burner.\nYou can minimize the leaching of metals by only using wooden utensils in stainless steel pots and pans. Metal utensils scratch the surface and release more metals.\nThese answers were provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

She is the author of Home Safe Home.\nDo you have a suggestion for safe, non-toxic everyday dinnerware?\nDEBRA'S ANSWER:\nPersonally, I stay away from plastic dishware of any kind. I have an assorted collection of dishware and glassware that includes clear glass, handmade pottery, recycled glass, and an old set of Wedgewood china that was given to me as a gift.\nAside from plastic--which is obviously identifiable--the most important thing to watch out for is the lead used in glazes. And it's not just brightly colored dishware from other countries that is a problem--most major manufacturers of dinnerware sold in department stores and home-decorating shops still use lead glazes, without labeling them as such. The federal government prohibits the sale of dinnerware that releases lead in amounts greater than 2,000 ppb which prevents direct cases of lead poisoning, but the state of California requires warning labels on any dishware that releases lead in amounts greater than 224 ppb, to protect against long-term health risks.\nI like to purchase dishware from local potters. Many now use lead-free glazes and you can ask them directly if lead-free glaze was used.\nThe other option is to test a sample of the dishware with a home lead-testing swabs . That way you know for sure.\nI've listed some links to websites with safe dinnerware on Debra's List .\nAnd here is a link with a long list of dinnerware brands that meet the California standards . Remember these are not necessarily lead-free, but rather those that meet the California standards.\nEnvironmental Defense has an excellent article on lead in dinnerware that includes phone numbers for some major manufacturers that can tell you about the glazes used on specific patterns.

The same amount of regular black tea has 40-120 milligrams and decaf has 2-10).\nNow, to the essence of the question: does decaf coffee/tea have bad chemicals in it from the decaffeinating process?\nQuick Answer: Potentially.\nCurrently, there are three main processes used for decaffeination:\nDirect Solvent Method\nCO2\nWater Processing\n1 - Direct solvent method: - a technique that uses methylene chloride (which the FDA banned in hairsprays and cosmetics due to inhalation risks), coffee oil, or ethyl acetate (a low-toxicity solvent naturally present in wines) to dissolve the caffeine and extract it from the coffee.\nClearly, the process using methylene chloride is the one that has stirred public panic about decaf coffee. Still, according to Methylene chloride decaffeination: bad process: or bad press? by Shea Sturdivant in the Tea & Coffee Trade Journal, only minute traces of the chemical are left after the process is complete. \"Methylene chloride evaporates at 100 to 200 [degrees] F; beans are usually roasted at temperature of 350 to 425 [degrees] F, and coffee is brewed at 190 to 212 [degrees] F. Any amounts of methylene chloride left in brewed coffee would be less than one part per million.\"\nAlso, \"According to a report published on August 9, 1985, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, studies of rats fed regular and decaffeinated coffee (at doses equivalent to 70 or 80 cups of coffee per day) or fed methylene chloride in their drinking water (at doses equivalent to 125,000 to 6,250,000 cups of decaffeinated coffee per day) showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. . . . Hence, scientific evidence suggests that methylene chloride is safe for use as a solvent in decaffeinating coffee.\"\nBut, as proponents of being safe rather than sorry - especially during pregnancy - you may want to avoid beverages that have been decaffeinated using this method. And, thinking big picture - the workers in charge of this method are at a much higher risk - so you should consider avoiding it to support worker health.\n2 - CO2: (technically known as supercritical fluid extraction) uses a pressurized method with a water or charcoal filtration to remove the caffeine.\n3 - Water processing (also known as the Swiss Water Process) simply uses water and a carbon filtration system to remove the caffeine.\nCO2 and water processing are safer options since they do not utilize hazardous solvents, but the direct solvent method is preferred by manufacturers because it's the most affordable and has the capacity to remove the highest percentage of caffeine.\nThis answer was provided by our fabulous Chief Communications Officer, Janelle .

Let us know!\nHow Can I Avoid Genetically Modified Foods?\nQUESTION:\nI'm on a kick to boycott all GMOs [genetically modified organisms] because I don't want to support environmentally toxic agricultural policies. But how do I know for sure that the food I'm buying doesn't somehow contain genetically modified ingredients?\n-Mary\nANSWER:\nThis week's headline-grabbing news that agriculture giant Monsanto's genetically modified corn was found to cause organ failure in rats is sure to send panicked shoppers into an anti-frankenfood frenzy. The good news is that this is precisely the kind of damning study (GM corn + animals = death) that will help bring to light the potentially catastrophic consequences of scientifically altered crops. The bad news is that even those who see that light will have a difficult time completely boycotting genetically modified organisms , or GMOs as they've come to be known.\nThat's because GMOs aren't just limited to the foods we eat; they're also in the clothes we wear (cotton is one of the most prevalent GMO crops) and in the everyday household products we use. Those who buy giant jugs of distilled white vinegar to make DIY eco-friendly cleaning products might be interested to know that their vinegar may, in fact, be distilled from GMO corn. I say may, because if you live in the United States, there's no proof that the products you buy or the food you serve your children hasn't been genetically tampered with. While the EU, Japan, China, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand have labeling laws for GMO foods, there are no such requirements in the US, despite the fact that a 2008 CBS News poll found that an overwhelming 87 percent of Americans would like GMO foods to be labeled.\nAs usual, lawmakers are light-years behind the American consumer. And with a GM crop pioneer now firmly planted in the Obama administration as director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, I'm not holding my breath for GMO crops to be restricted in the US anytime soon. Here's how you can take charge in the meantime:\nBuy organic. Organic foods must be processed without bioengineering, but look for labels saying either 95 or 100 percent organic as anything less could still include GMO ingredients. And if you can't afford to buy everything organic, at least make sure that the animal products you purchase -- meat, dairy, eggs -- are. With conventional beef, for instance, you can be pretty sure that mountains of Roundup Ready corn were fed to those cows. That conventional zucchini? Not as looming a threat, at least where GMOs are concerned.\nBeware the SCCC. No, it's not some new government agency (though maybe it should be). That stands for soy, cotton, canola, and corn, which are among the most common GMO crops. The statistics are startling: 91 percent of soy, 87 percent of cotton, 75 percent of canola, and 73 percent of corn crops grown in the US are GMO, according to the USDA. So unless the label specifically says organic, you can pretty much bet that any food or product you buy that contains any of the big four have been genetically changed. We're not just talking tofu and tortilla chips, either: It's the sheets on your bed, those potato chips fried in cottonseed oil, and the aspartame in your Diet Coke (made using a fermentation process that involves soy and corn).\nAvoid processed, packaged foods. Thanks to farming subsidies that have produced unimaginable surpluses of cheap (mostly GMO) corn, we now have dozens of corn-based ingredients served up to us in increasingly creative ways by the processed food industry. As Michael Pollan points out in The Omnivore's Dilemma, \"Corn is in the coffee whitener and Cheez Whiz, the frozen yogurt and TV dinner, the canned fruit and ketchup and candies, the soups and snacks and cake mixes...there are some 45,000 items in the average American supermarket and more than a quarter of them now contain corn.\" Bottom line: If you're concerned about GMOs, don't eat anything with an advertising budget .\nCheck out the Non-GMO Shopping Guide . The site just launched last month, and offers more tips on how to avoid GMOs. The guide also includes lists of common name-brand foods that may contain them, as well as ones that are GMO-free.\nFinally, the most important thing you can do, beyond voting with your dollars: Call your Congressperson to say that you want to see mandatory GMO labeling laws. If the jury is still out as to whether GMOs cause organ failure, then we shouldn't have to play this guessing game every time we go to the supermarket.\nThis piece, by Jennifer Grayson , originally appeared in Huffington Post .

I had a little garden growing in my kitchen and the fruit flies moved in with my kale and broccoli. I've gotten rid of the plants but the flies are still here. Any suggestions?\nANSWER:\nFruit flies are a real nuisance, but they\u2019re easy enough to get rid of using non-toxic solutions. Here are some methods to try:\nPour a little sweet cheap white wine (Riesling) in a glass and add a drop of a natural soap to break the surface tension. Place near infected area. The fruit flies will drown trying to drink the wine.\nPour some apple cider vinegar into a glass, and place a paper funnel over the container. Fruit flies are attracted to the smell and fly into the glass, but 4 out of 5 can\u2019t find the way back out.\nMix some basil oil with water and spray your kitchen. Fruit flies are repelled by the smell of basil.\nThis answer was provided by our fabulous Senior Editor, Janelle . See all of our questions and answers at Get Answers . Do you have a question? Let us know!\nI can\u2019t go organic with everything. Are there some foods that matter more?\nYes! If you can\u2019t make the switch fully, there are definitely some products that are more dangerous than others. Sometimes referred to as the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d the following produce are especially important to go organic with: peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, imported grapes, spinach, pears, lettuce, and potatoes. By switching to organic for only these items, you can eliminate exposure to about 15 different pesticides!\nAnimal products ranging from meat to dairy are always important to eat organic. Conventional products can contain hormones used for growth, antibiotics used to prevent disease, chemical and toxins in pesticides and more. Learn more about going organic!\nThe \u201cConsistently Clean\u201d list identifies products that are generally tested to be free of pesticides and includes: onions, avocados, sweet corn, papaya, mango, pineapple, asparagus, kiwi, broccoli, cabbage and sweet peas. These products are less important to buy organic. Visit the Environmental Working Group\u2019s website for more detailed information.\nI want to buy organic foods, but they are just too expensive! What can I do?\nDon\u2019t get discouraged! There are less expensive ways to buy organic foods.\nIn general organic food does cost more. Organic produce costs about 20% more than its conventionally grown counterpart and organic meats can cost up to 3 times as much. There are strategies you can use to find healthy, organic foods that fit your budget.\nLook for sales at your local grocery stores. Buying in bulk for foods with a long shelf life will shave a ton off of the price. Also, always try to buy locally, seasonally, and from the source. Farmer\u2019s markets are a great way to find less expensive safe, natural foods while supporting local growers. Since you are buying directly from the producer and close to home, it will often cost less. Additionally, foods that are out of season locally can be more expensive because of the oil used to transport the food over great distances.\nLearn more about a cost-effective organic lifestyle.\nIs there Lead in my reverse osmosis spigot?\nQUESTION:\nWe have well water with a reverse osmosis (RO) unit under our kitchen sink. I recently met a man who was working with the laws for testing lead in Nebraska. He said that currently there are problems with many of the spigots leaching large amounts of lead into the RO water. He is trying to change the testing procedures to just test the first small amount of water that is drawn from the spigot first thing in the morning rather than the normal testing of one liter of water. He is worried that the one-liter testing is diluting the lead levels and not looking at real life use\u2014filling up small glass of water for your child. He also said that the original spigots that come with the RO unit are not as bad; however, the replacement spigots that are often used to match other colors of kitchen faucets are sometimes showing up to ten times the allowable limit of lead. Our spigot is a replacement so I am really worried. I have contacted a state authorized lab for lead testing in water and we will be testing our RO water (both a small and one liter sample size for testing). I'm just wondering if others have heard anything about this? Does anyone know of a source for spigots that are lead free and safe from other contaminates, preferably manufactured in the USA?\nThanks!\nANSWER:\nI wrote a post a couple of years ago about Lead-Free Water Faucets . I don't know what the regulations are for replacement spigots, but the lead issues may be similar.\nI suggest that you test the water coming out of your R/O unit for lead to be sure.\nDebra\nThis answer was provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

Are there any alternatives to these kinds of products that don't use PVC? What kinds of plastics are safer?\nNo, not all plastic wraps, baggies, etc. are made of PVC plastic. In general, the commercial wraps (used in delis or supermarkets) are the ones most likely to be made from PVC. There are other wraps made from safer plastics available. There are also plastic containers that are safer .

It says right on the label that it is made only from natural oils and beeswax. I even called the company, who assured me it was \"all-natural\". \u2028\u2028We've been using it on our wooden salad bowls and cutting boards since I found it in a fancy San Francisco cooking store years ago. Just recently, we used it to finish the wooden top on a kitchen island we built. It really protects the wood - water beads right up and we felt good having the beeswax around our organic food. It has no odor, except for the slight sweetness of beeswax.\nThe Holland Bowl Mill website says it has received many letters from customers telling them B's Oil is so gentle that they use it as their favorite hand cream moisturizer. \u2028\u2028So I was surprised to find out that it is actually made from beeswax and mineral oil! I had a long phone conversation with the owner and made sure he understood that you cannot label a product containing mineral oil as natural. I see he has changed the description on his website after our conversation.\nI set out to find a truly all-natural wood conditioner for my wooden salad bowls and cutting boards, and discovered some interesting things even many woodworkers don't know. \u2028\u2028It is important to apply some kind of protection to wood cutting boards and bowls before using them the first time, to prevent staining and absorption of food odors and bacteria, and to keep water from penetrating the wood, which results in warping and cracking.\nSome suggest \"seasoning\" the wood with oil, just as you would a cast-iron pan. Warm the oil slightly, and apply in the direction of the grain, allowing it to soak in between each coat. Apply four or five coats of oil. Wait about four to six hours between coats, and wipe off any excess oil that did not soak in before applying the next coat of warm oil.\nDebra :-)\nThis answer was provided by our friend, Debra Lynn Dadd .

Foods grown conventionally are treated with chemicals and pesticides to control weeds and pests, prevent plant disease and fertilize soil. These chemicals and toxic materials can remain on foods long after they are harvested and can pose health threats to you and your family. Exposure to these harmful materials is especially dangerous for children as they develop.\nEating organic food reduces the amount of dangerous materials in our bodies.

'Jack Frost' , vermiculite , garden centers , vegetable gardening , Cindy Murphy\nLast week, two of my co-workers, my boss, and I drove up to Grand Rapids at an ungodly hour unfit for man or beast.\u00a0 Ok, admittedly, the hour is not so early to bother anyone but The Perpetually Late, and that would be me!\u00a0 (Although I\u2019m usually up by 5am, I had to leave home an hour and a half earlier than I normally do, and it\u2019s always a struggle for me to get out of the house on time.)\u00a0 We were headed to the last trade show of the season, where we placed the bulk of the garden center\u2019s hardgood orders for next spring.\u00a0 Despite the ungodly hour, the van was alive with excitement.\nField trip!\u00a0 Remember as kid the excitement surrounding field trips?\u00a0 Going on a field trip meant a day away from the classroom, a break from the routine, and a change of scenery.\u00a0 For me, the enthusiasm never waned.\nAlthough this last trade show was in late September, August seemed to be the field trip month for us at the nursery.\u00a0 During the month\u2019s second week, our college intern and I went to Walter\u2019s Gardens, Inc. in Zeeland, Michigan, just a short drive up the road.\nWalters Gardens, Inc. ,\u00a0founded in the 1940s, is the largest bare root perennial wholesale grower in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 With 1,500 acres and 500,000 square feet of greenhouses, they grow over 1,5000 perennial varieties, shipping between 15 and 20 million perennial liners to independent garden centers, wholesale growers, and landscape companies each year.\u00a0 On the grounds are extensive display gardens, open to the public with no appointment necessary (though they do like a phone call beforehand).\nI\u2019ve been to Walters\u2019 display gardens in the past; with nearly 100 new varieties added to Walters\u2019 offerings each year, it\u2019s never the same garden twice.\u00a0 I\u2019m responsible for ordering perennials for the nursery; seeing how plants grow in a garden helps me choose what I\u2019ll order, and Walters Gardens is one of the suppliers I use.\u00a0 Things look different in a catalog, and behave different in a garden than they do in pots.\u00a0 A tour of the display gardens in August after the plants have bore the brunt of all the excessive rain, heat, and humidity this summer threw at them, gave me a good idea of what perennials I\u2019ll place on our fall order for spring delivery; I don\u2019t want to carry something at the nursery that isn\u2019t going to stand up well in customers\u2019 gardens.\nOne plant that\u2019s definitely on my list to order, as it has been for the past decade, is Brunnera macrophylla \u2018Jack Frost\u2019.\u00a0 A Walters Gardens introduction, \u2018Jack Frost\u2019 Brunnera has been named the 2012 Perennial Plant Association\u2019s Plant of the Year, the most prestigious perennial award in the country.\nWalters Gardens first introduced the plant in 2000, and it\u2019s been a favorite of shade gardeners ever since.\u00a0 Brunnera \u2018Jack Frost\u2019 grows in zones 3 to 8, prefers shade and moist, but well-drained soil; its heart-shaped silver and green leaves are complimented by tiny blue flowers in spring.\nNext up on the field trip itinerary was Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier in mid-August for the Independent Garden Center Show.\u00a0 A nice thing about attending the IGC Show is that some of the products showcased there are only sold to independent garden centers\u2026meaning they aren\u2019t available to the box stores.\u00a0 It\u2019s the largest trade show of its kind, featuring thousands of new gardening products and ideas from over 1,000 vendors. New plant introductions, living walls (very, very cool), birding supplies, garden art, arbors, statuary, and the more utilitarian garden basics such as fertilizers, soil conditioners, and pesticides are just a smattering of products displayed at the show.\nBased on the number of vendors offering supplies, it seems the fairy gardening craze continues for 2012.\u00a0 There is a fairy gardening craze?\u00a0 I guess we aren\u2019t trendy enough, because we hadn\u2019t realized there was a trend.\u00a0 But, yes \u2013 now your garden fairies can keep up with the Jones\u2019 fairies with wrought iron gazebos and fencing, tiny bistro sets to sit at while drinking tiny cups of whatever it is that fairies drink, fairy-sized swings, and whatever else a fairy might need to enjoy time spent in their garden.\u00a0 I briefly wondered what would use a one-inch ceramic birdbath.\u00a0 A mosquito, perhaps?\u00a0 Though fairy gardening is not my taste, and we all agreed fairy gardening merchandize was not something our garden center\u2019s customers would go nuts over, it is enchanting.\u00a0 That is one of the cool things about gardening\u2026.whether it\u2019s flower gardening, gardening for wildlife, gardening for fairies, or vegetable gardening, there is something to pique everyone\u2019s interest.\nSpeaking of vegetable gardening, the IGC show had more products than ever to assist the growing population of those that are growing their own food, for both the experienced gardener, and for those just getting started.\u00a0 Prefab raised bed kits made from a variety of materials \u2013 recycled plastics, corrugated steel, and white-cedar, just to name a few \u2013 were in abundance.\u00a0 Many of the kits retail for just about the same as it would cost to construct your own, but without the hassles of measuring and cutting.\u00a0 Vendors offering greenhouse and cold-frame kits, organic gardening products, tools, and both organic and heirloom seed were well-represented.\nA co-worker and I stopped to chat with a representative from one of the heirloom seed companies \u2013 a gentleman by the name of Paul Wallace, from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds .\u00a0\u00a0We talked about seeds, and he then showed us The Heirloom Gardener magazine, a gorgeous thing printed on thick, high-gloss paper, full of beautiful photos and enticing-sounding articles.\u00a0 Thumbing through it, I came across an article about turkeys\u2026written by none other than Oscar H. Will III \u2013 Hank, of course, from Grit, (I later recognized the magazine\u2019s editor, Karen Keb, as being Hank\u2019s wife and culinary partner in crime).\n\u201cHey, I know him\u2026.sort of\u201d, I pointed to the page with Hank\u2019s article, explaining my association with Grit magazine.\n\u201cYou know Hank?\u00a0 Nice guy.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be at The National Heirloom Exposition.\u00a0 You both should come\u201d, he said, handing my co-worker and I pamphlets.\nHeld in Sonoma, California, The National Heirloom Exposition ran for three days in September with workshops, demonstrations, and seminars, (along with Hank, KC Compton was on the roster of speakers), all focusing on heritage agriculture.\u00a0 And food!\nAnother field trip?!\u00a0 Unfortunately, it was hard enough to break away for a day in Chicago; flying across country for nearly a week is impossible.\u00a0 Drats!\u00a0 Hope you had fun, Hank and KC \u2013 the Expo sounded like a good time.\nOne of the new products that we saw at both trade shows was the EarthBox Jr.. EarthBoxes are self-contained gardening systems that use less water and fertilizer and require less maintenance than do conventional container gardens.\u00a0 We\u2019ve carried EarthBoxes\u00a0at the garden center for a number of years, and in our opinion they are better made than a lot of the knock-off self-contained gardening systems we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 Based on our customer feedback, it produces great results.\u00a0 The Organic EarthBox Jr. Kit will be on our shelves next spring, next to the full-sized Organic EarthBox Kits.\nFor those of you who use a lot of vermiculite, you might want to stock up this fall.\u00a0 The scuttlebutt is that it will be much more expensive next year; one vendor speculates it\u2019ll double in price.\u00a0 Vermiculite has many uses in industrial manufacturing and gardeners use it to loosen soil, and for its moisture retaining properties.\u00a0 The forecasted higher price is due to a higher worldwide demand, and a global shortage of quality product (many sources have been found to contain trace metals and other impurities).\u00a0 Currently quality vermiculite is being mined in South Africa and the United States.\u00a0 An alternative to vermiculite would be perlite, which also conditions soil, mixed with a coarse peat moss to retain moisture.\u00a0 I found just a few sites on the Internet verifying a possible price increase, but if you use a lot of vermiculite, it might be worth checking into further.\nTime spent after the field trips has been busy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got all the perennial orders placed for next year, we\u2019ve got a gorgeous display of hand-built birdhouses constructed out of wood and iron from old barns in Illinois that we ordered at the IGC show, and we\u2019ve been rearranging the store to allow for a bigger area devoted to vegetable gardening.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got a slew of new gardening ideas I want to try at home, and a handy-dandy Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company 2012 calendar on which to plan them and schedule other gardening tasks as well.\nWhat plans do you have for the next gardening season?\nAnd oh! do you believe in fairies?\n"}, {"score": 384.5432, "uuid": "a9e43f71-6cdf-5d11-aedf-0f95d36034c2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-48-10463", "target_hostname": "4dtraveler.net", "target_uri": "http://4dtraveler.net/", "page_rank": 1.4152093e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "4dtraveler | The life and times <em>of</em> a traveler <em>in</em> time.", "snippet": "Other than for my eyesight, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> beginning to deteriorate, and an occasional ache <em>or</em> stiffness first thing <em>in</em> the morning, I feel fine.

On Donna\u2019s way home from work on February 20, she stopped at Four Winds Music Store and bought Jane an English recorder for $7.50 and a beginner\u2019s music book.\nJane showed considerable enthusiasm at learning to play her recorder so we coached her a little every day. A month later, Jane had progressed far enough with her music and was still showing an interest in playing, so we set her up with music lessons. Her first private lesson was on Saturday, March 14, with\u00a0Sharon. Sharon, a Elementary School music teacher in her 40s, gave Jane lessons in her home. Sharon explained early training procedures, so we could continue practicing effectively at home. Then for twenty minutes, Sharon and Jane practiced rhythmically tapping their hands, the proper method to hold the recorder, how to hold her fingers to form a \u2018b\u2019 note then rhythmically \u2018tooting\u2019 the \u2018b\u2019 note. When Jane learned a series of prescribed lessons, she was to be brought back for her next instruction.\nJane returned to Sharon for lessons in April, May and June, each time having shown great improvement over her previous visit. Meanwhile, Donna spent about 15 minutes a day with Jane assisting as she practiced fingering notes and playing her beginner\u2019s scales. By mid June, Jane was playing songs like Hot Cross Buns, and Mary Had A\u00a0 Little Lamb, which was exceptional for a three year seven month old preschooler!\u00a0 8-)\nDonna\u2019s job at True Value Hardware\nAbout one and a half years passed since Donna was hired as a bookkeeper at True Value Hardware store. Although she attended college and became a teacher with a California Secondary School Teaching License, she had never found a teaching position in Education. For the last fifteen years she worked in the bookkeeping and accounting departments of several different companies.\nTrue Value Hardware is rather large for a hardware store, with 8500 square feet retail floor space, six full time and four part time employees. The store has a full line of hardware, plumbing, electrical, paint, pant sundries, hand tools, as well as an adequate line of house wares, small appliances and seasonal lawn and garden merchandise.\nWhen Donna was hired, True Value was doing its bookkeeping in handwritten ledger books. Soon, Wayne, the owner,\nrealized how much computer experience Donna had, so he bought a 286 IBM desk top computer, printer, etc., to convert the bookkeeping from handwritten to computerized records. Donna \u2018brought the office into the Twentieth Century,\u2019 buying, installing, and configuring the Peachtree Accounting software program to operate with their bookkeeping system and entering the data files to bring the records up to date.\nThe company needed to hire a part time girl for several months to help keypunch the account data in at night. Donna told our neighbor, Arlene, that the job was opened. After her\u00a0 interview, Arlene was given the job and Donna trained her in what she was to do.\n[At right, a 1987 photograph of Donna standing beside the driveway in our homesite.]\nSince Donna spends most of her time working alone in the office, she has the benefit of pretty much setting her own hours. She was given a store key and can start work before the store opens, as is required when doing the monthly book closings. She takes the daily receipts to the bank and during slow periods helps work on merchandise displays. At times, she is called to the sales floor to either wait on customers or handle the cash register\nDonna began her employment at True Value at a wage of $5.50 per hour, after thirty days training, her pay was increased 50\u00a2 to $6.00 per hour. Now, after two \u2018cost of living\u2019 increases she is earning $6.55 per hour. For comparison, the sales floor personnel earn wages ranging from $4.00 to $5.95 per hour, however, Donna is still earning about $2.00 per hour less than she did working at Landy Packing Company. Although she earns less on a hourly basis, she does get a lot of overtime which goes a long way to making up for the pay differential. Besides working a half day every other Sunday, Donna\u00a0 usually put in about two hours overtime (at one and half times regular pay) each week.\nInstalling a split rail yard fence\nBeginning in early June, and finishing around the end of the month, we spend our weekends and some evenings installing a commercially made, two rail split-rail fence. The fence was set along the two hundred feet of driveway bordering the upper yard from the yard gate, around a semi circle to the garage.\u00a0 It had been a few years since we\u2019d installed the perimeter fence posts around the yard, so our renewed post hole digging sessions brought back old memories and sore muscles. Compounding the problem, we had a swarm of pesky Summer\u00a0 gnats that flew into our eyes, ears and mouths with regularity.\nWhen installed, the fence looked very nice and we realized we should have put it in earlier.\u00a0 The rustic split rail style fits right in with our wooded surroundings, making the yard\u00a0 look all that much more peaceful, serene and at one with nature, like the home of a National Park Forest Ranger.\n[Photograph above, a 1987 summer morning at Nightstar*. Our upper front yard bordered by the newly installed split rail fence. We installed the fence by digging in a post or two each morning before work and maybe 3-4 per weekend\u00a0day for about two weeks.\nAs of 1987, its been about 14 years since we decided to move out of California, 10 years since\u00a0we bought the 39 acre property and 8 years since we became residents.]\nAt 3 years old, Jane begins reading\nAll the work Donna, Jane and I have been doing to\u00a0teach Jane her alphabet and simple words has begun to pay off. On the morning of June 18, when\u00a0Jane and I\u00a0sat down to read from her book, Tom The TV Cat, Jane announced,\n\u2018I can read the book to you, an\u2019 mommy didn\u2019t tell me how.\u2019\nSomewhat taken back, and surprised by Jane\u2019s statement, I replied,\n\u2018Ohh? You can? Well, what are you going to read to me?\u2019\nJane placed her finger beneath a line in the open book and read, \u2018He did mouse work.\u2019 My head jerked sideways toward Jane, with full realization that this was the first time she had ever initiated reading aloud. Jane began reading sentences at three years seven months of age, approximately six months after learning the alphabet!\u00a0 :-)\nAs the months passed, Jane and I read more children\u2019s books together than it would be practical to list here. Some of the titles, however, included: Other People-Other Homes, Safety First-Home, Safety First-Fire, Continents, Oceans, Volcanoes, Deserts, Pioneers, West Indies, Japan, Ireland, I Like Kindergarten, Beavers\u2026\nMusic [midi: Labyrinth Melody]\nA dream about gathering family signatures\nDuring late June, I began collecting autographs of family members [1] .\nIn order to extract ancestral signatures, our original documents were photocopied. Liquid paper was then used to blot out all other words near the ancestors name, in this way we ended up with a \u2018clean\u2019 signature. The signature was then cut out and pasted to a sheet of white paper and photocopied onto a piece of fine quality linen paper. This copy was cut out and placed inside a Show Guard postage stamp mount for storage.\nSeveral days after this process was begun, I awoke during the middle of the night with an upset stomach and had a difficult time returning to sleep. I laid quietly in bed, neither awake or asleep, but in some drowsy middle ground where the mind drifts between dreams and imagination.\nAll of a sudden, my mind\u2019s eye was, as it were, looking into a pool of unstill water; as the water became quiet, an image formed. The image was of my maternal grandparents, Pearl Elmer Shafer and wife, Alma Delight Kellogg, as they stood in a room signing my mother and father\u2019s marriage license. I watched them through the pool- like, watery image, from a position above and behind them, near the ceiling.\nIn those brief moments that I was there observing, I overheard several quiet words spoken by the preacher, saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the pen. Sign here.\u2019 (while pointing). My grandparents appeared solemn, their minds trying to focus on the official act of signing the license. They were totally absorbed in the emotions of the marriage of their daughter, Hazel. There was\u00a0tenseness in the room, also a sense of duty, happiness and sadness.\nHaving signed the license, they turned their attention elsewhere. In an instant the document swirled into the watery pool toward me. In another instant, I had separated their names from the other extraneous print on the marriage license. I turned my gaze and looked\u00a0 back into the pool. No more than a few seconds had elapsed for my grandparents, they were just beginning to turn away from the desk where the license\u00a0laid. On the surface of the document, the ink signatures were just beginning to dry.\nI looked at my grandparents through the pool, they were only a few feet distance, but walking away from the center of the room toward the door. They were totally oblivious of the potential that their act created, of my presence and concern with their signature on that piece of paper. Yet, how could they know? I was a person, whom in their time didn\u2019t exist. I was reaching from the future, reaching back for their signatures.\nThe marriage license was simply a document, a contract\u00a0joining two persons, complete with names, intentions, date, and the signatures of the officials and witnesses. It was a piece of paper that documented an event in space-time, but there was more, much more. In the act of signing their names they had left a personal, physical record of their individuality and the operation of their minds and, they had created a linking event in\u00a0a different space-\u00a0time.\nI mused over the fact that photocopiers hadn\u2019t yet been invented in 1941 when my parents were married. Then comically, I recalled that parts of rural America weren\u2019t even electrified at that time. I grinned to myself, smug and knowing. I marveled that a \u2018future person\u2019 could seemingly reach back in time and separate the mark, movement and psychological trace of a person from an event in the distant past where the background was becoming increasingly noisy. I wondered what future technology might allow us to do and how easy it would be for people in my future to look back and extract our spoor and trace.\nStartled by that realization, I opened my eyes and starred into the darkness of the bedroom, and knew you were near.\n[Above, a photocopy of some of my family signatures, dating from the 1620 Mayflower Pilgrims to roughly the mid 1800s.]\nThey lie about us, quiet and\u00a0potential\nIt is\u00a0practically a universal human trait to remain\u00a0unaware\u00a0and oblivious of those human forms on which light does not yet shine, the unborn, or upon those whom lived before.\nYet, the creatures that will track us, lie amongst the soil of the garden and field, they lie quietly amongst the leaves in the trees of the forest and in the air above the sea. They are about us, without the code of our form, having not yet been called forth to rise again from the chemical environment.\u00a0 They lie inert and potential as we walk, talk, write, laugh and live. Given our chromosomal code, the soil, water and air combine into life, that will, in the fullness of time, seek out the chain of life which brought forth its body from the dust.\nThey will know that their ancestors have created locally increased order in the energy flow. The order they left has become covered with layers of events, like the layers of an onion, enfolded, shell-like, evolving and expanding\u00a0away from the core events of a\u00a0specific time, moving\u00a0toward\u00a0increasing general disorder.\nOur ancestors, the people before,\u00a0are currently going about their lives in their own space-time, naive and innocent of how you and I are becoming more and more capable of stirring the technological cauldron, peeling away the layers of that metaphorical\u00a0onion and calling forth their trace from our own space-time addresses.\nThe ocean-like currents of space-time carry flotsam and jetsam from the distant shores of history to our present. Some of the material goods, capacity for love and ideas that we throw into this ocean, from our own life experience,\u00a0wash up on the shores of the future.\nFamily genealogists, County Historical Societies, Museum curators and archeologists are not unlike astronomers, the former looking across the spance of\u00a04-dimensional\u00a0space time to make sence of human life\u00a0in the\u00a0time flow, the latter looking into the depths\u00a0of 3-dimensional space to make sense of\u00a0aggregates with in\u00a0the\u00a0volume.\n\u2018Grandma and Grandpa Pierce are dead, huh?\u2019\nOn Friday, July 17, while Jane and I were chatting during\u00a0lunch, when the subject of my parents came up. Quizzically, Jane asked, \u2018Grandma and Grandpa Pierce are dead, huh?\u2019 Stunned by her statement, I promptly advised her that they were alive and well, reminding her that she wrote them a letter. She remembered writing the letter, but then averted her eyes, looking away as if searching for more memories or a positive outcome from them. I changed the subject of our conversation, not wanting to tell her that she wrote them six months earlier and they still hadn\u2019t answered her letter. I supposed they were angry with me over some infraction of etiquette or minor instance of moral impurity.\nDrought\nDuring early April, extremely dry weather caused me to occasionally set the lawn sprinkler up and water into the woods along our yard\u2019s west side. The same unusually dry conditions brought official recognition that Minnesota and the upper central Midwest were experiencing the worst fire threat in ten years.\nBy late June 24, the St. Cloud Times was reporting:\n\u201cDrought, Heat Threaten Corn Crop.\nMany Central Minnesota farmers are watching their crops wither and wilt under unusually hot, rainless skies. Conditions are so bad in many rural areas in Central Minnesota that some Extension Directors and Crop Specialists are comparing this year to the dust bowl days of the 1930s\u2026 Many farmers will not be able to salvage another cutting of alfalfa\u2026others have already began to cut and bale their oats because the crop would not produce enough grain to harvest later this summer\u2026the next two weeks will be crucial as corn crops reach the tassling stage that gives way to pollination\u2026\u201d\nMeanwhile, even our lawn, which I had begun to water was not growing at its normal proliferate rate. Although I enjoyed the easier and quicker mowing sessions, I didn\u2019t like to see the lawn drying and yellowing so early in the season.\nBy the end of June, residents of Waite Park, a suburb of St. Cloud, were under a \u2018watering ban\u2019 and being threatened with City government \u2018warnings\u2019 that could lead to a charge of \u2018petty misdemeanor\u2019 if they were caught operating lawn or garden sprinklers!\nDonna and I had noted that our dry Spring and early Summer had been almost mosquito-bite free. The super dry weather had eliminated the mosquitoes breeding and hatching habitat in our lowland and fen bog and so provided us with a pleasant, mosquito free season. We certainly enjoyed going outside to work about the yard and garden and not having to continuously swat at mosquitoes.\nGathering genealogical documents\nJune and July were busy months, as I continued work on family, genealogical research projects.\u00a0 Among the items I sent for and received were:\n1) Photocopies of the Revolutionary War records of 4G-grandfather (Lieutenant, then Captain) John Anderson, from the National Archives.\n2) An inventory of personal property of 3G-grandfather, James Anderson, at the time of his death and a 1855 map of the farm and surrounding area [2] where, James, and his father, John,\u00a0 lived; received from the Greene County Library Historical Reading Room, Ohio.\n3) The thirteen page photocopy of 2G-grandfather, Civil War veteran, (Pvt.) Harmon Anderson\u2019s Last Will, also copies of the official death certificates for Harmon and wife, Margaret (Horney) Anderson from the Greene County Courthouse, Jefferson, Iowa.\n4) Last Will of 4G grandfather\u2019s John Anderson and Revolutionary War soldier (Pvt.) William Horney, from the Greene County Library Historical Reading Room, Ohio.\u00a0John Anderson\u00a0and William\u00a0Horney were amongst my paternal 4G-grandparents.\nGeneral activities in genealogical research\nDuring the previous year, Donna and I read had each several books on genealogical research.\nFor a couple years prior to Eulah\u2019s death, Donna, her mother and half sister Katherine, exchanged genealogical information related to the Dorr-Roberts side of their family. Later, Don sent Donna a photocopied genealogical tree and booklet that members of\u00a0his side of the family had worked on years earlier\nAfter Eulah\u2019s death, Donna began correspondence with several other relatives and continued accumulating genealogical data and stories on both her father\u2019s and mother\u2019s (the Dorr-Roberts) sides of her family. Every couple weeks,\u00a0she received a page or two of information from one source or another.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0I was\u00a0trying to organize the rapiodly growing volume of genealogical data in a way that would allow:\n\u2022\u00a0 a global storage method of the information,\n\u2022 simplify information transfer to the reader,\n\u2022 show images of the original documents,\n\u2022 show relationships between obscure family members and family lines.\nMy 45th birthday: a personal inventory [3]\nBirthdays are good \u2018life referencing days\u2019, times\u00a0to reflect and take a personal inventory.\nTo wit: I was born on July 25th, 1942 and am glad, if not a little surprised to have lived as long as I have.\nOther than for my eyesight, which is beginning to deteriorate, and an occasional ache or stiffness first thing in the morning, I feel fine. I have been fortunate all these years to have had good health, most of my illnesses have been either colds or the flu.\nLooking in the mirror, I appear to be in my late thirties, with clear blue eyes and a face without wrinkles. My brown hair has neither begun to thin or recede. About five years ago, I found two gray hairs sprouting just to the front of my right ear, they are still the only gray hairs I have.\nMy body is in good tone from the work I do about the yard, splitting wood in the spring and fall, mowing grass all summer and raking leaves in the fall. I currently weigh one hundred seventy nine pounds and am a few pounds overweight, the excess has settled around my waist giving me a small paunch.\nI have a loving wife and daughter, both of whom I love very much We live together in a place of quiet, natural beauty, accompanied by a family of dogs, several ducks and geese, a large variety of birds and other chattering, skulking and silent creatures of the forest and swamp. Here we enjoy the seasons and the days of our lives, removed from the noise, eyesores and other disturbances of a hurried, hungry world.\nI enjoy doing outdoor projects, reading, and the type of work that goes into my journals. My interests are many and varied, they grow and change with my social, economic, genealogical, science, and space-time interests.\nA family birthday party\nAfter lunch, I washed up, shaved and changed clothes. At 1:30 PM we three gathered around the kitchen table.\nDonna placed a store bought, Angel Food cake, with chocolate frosting in the center of the table, then brought out a gift wrapped box and set it on the table in front of me.\nThen, with Donna sitting across the table and Jane to my left, the girls happily sang the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 song to me. Looking about and smiling myself, I saw the family\u2019s\u00a0sparkling eyes and their beaming happy smiles. After reading my birthday card, signed by both Donna and Jane, I opened the mysterious and rather heavy gift.\nLo! Upon peeling away its gaily colored wrapping, I found several items packaged together:\n1) A letter box file for the long term storage of the personal mail I receive;\n2) A calligraphy set; and\n3) The out of print book, Bid Time Return, [4] a romantic time travel adventure. The\u00a0 movie, Somewhere In Time, which was partially responsible for my starting to keep journals, was based on the characters and plot of the book, Bid Time Return.\nThat evening we had a delicious supper of shish-ka-bob (meat and vegetables on a skewer, grilled), followed by a thin slice of cake and scoop of vanilla ice-cream.\nI put in a birthday request for a full body massage at bed time\u2026\nAnd, yes, the cherry went to the birthday boy!\u00a0 ;-)\nThe Archive project begins\nEver since 1980, when my father and Uncle Bill got me interested in family genealogy, documents and research papers have been accumulating [5] . We always worked on different ancestral family members, not because of a desire for efficiency, but because there were so many available lines of interest we simply never duplicated each other\u2019s work.\nEvery month or two, when a little more information had been tracked down, the documents or worksheet would be photocopied and sent to\u00a0our other two researchers. In this way, there was a fairly steady stream of genealogical information coming and going, all of which needed processing.\nI kept the data from our research on standard and recognized genealogical research forms: Family Group Records sheets, Pedigree Charts and Life Outlines. I had even sent several page, Personal Characteristics Profiles, out for aging relatives to answer regarding our shared ancestor, their parents or grandparents. All my papers were separated by individual or family groupings. At first, some of the information was entered in my Journals [6] .\nAs the years passed, the sheer volume of paperwork and data grew to such a point that it became necessary to put considerable time effort into organizing it.\nOrganizing the work was more than just separating the information by individual, family or location. Each piece of information, each document had to have a source and\u00a0be given\u00a0the best possible presentation of its information. The problem was that the photocopied documents I had, were received in many different sizes, while the network of the family relationships and their movements were spread across space-time in apparent profuse confusion.\nSince Donna had access to a quality photocopy machine at True Value Hardware, we bought a ream of archival grade linen paper for photocopy document storage. On Tuesday, July 28, I began a long process of cutting out the pertinent areas of information, from old US Census records, and taping them to white typing paper for photocopy transfer onto the archival grade, linen paper. All of the marriage, birth and death records, wills, property\u2019s, newspaper articles were also photocopied onto linen paper.\nWhen a research paper was written about some facet of an ancestor\u2019s life,\u00a0or an old map was copied to show a family\u2019s route of travel, when current photographs and perigee charts were drawn, all were organized and photocopied in the best format possible for maximizing the information content and long term storage.\nBeginning three days after my birthday and continuing for several years, I worked my way through nearly a full drawer of \u2018raw\u2019 paperwork \u00a0in the file cabinet, cleaning out the accumulation of my many genealogical file folders and condensing the paperwork\u00a0into informational bundles. The finished pages were organized in rough chronological sequence by family and stored in about a half dozen black, spring back notebooks. These notebooks\u00a0became known as \u2018The Archives\u2019.\nAfter several months work, preparing nearly the first one hundred pages for long term storage in the Archives, we came to recognize several facts about the effort:\n1) The labor involved in setting up the layout for each page: taping photographs, making boarders where necessary, and experimenting took no less than five minutes, while some took twenty minutes.\n2) For every document put into the Archive, there were four to six pieces of waste paper generated, besides the \u2018original\u2019 copies we received in the mail or copied from other sources. The waste came from testing the brightness, blowing up or shrinking documents on the photocopy machine.\n3) There was an unknown and uncalculated amount of work and expense involved, developing the data, i.e., researching sources, long distance telephone calls, mail, genealogy research\u00a0fees, official record coping fees, etc. that went into the Archives.\nMusic [midi: Star Vivaldi: The Four Seasons, 04 Violin L\u2019Estate, Op8-2]\nEarly morning\u2019s sights and sounds\nOn the morning of August 14, at 6:45 AM, about five minutes after Donna left for work, I stepped outside the front door to sit on the front steps, look about and listen to the peaceful sounds of the\u00a0morning.\nA shroud of fog laid across the land, limiting visibility to about four hundred feet. Even at the relatively near distance of two hundred feet, colors dissolved into gray, while forms back in the woods faded in the early morning\u2019s filtered light. Down by the pond, in our lower yard, the ducks and geese were standing in the grass, surrounded by fog. Several appeared to be asleep, others were preening their feathers.\nA gentle breeze began to rustle amongst the upper most tree branches at the edge of the nearby woods and I noticed for the first time, that the Maple trees leaves were beginning to turn\u00a0lime green. One slight gust shook a half dozen Maple leaves off a tree. I watched as they silently sliced back and forth through the air, dropping to join others on the ground, announcing the approach of Fall.\nI sat very still, listening.\nFrom somewhere back in the woods came the occasional chirp of an unseen bird, then the \u2018cohoo\u2026cohoo\u2019 of a Mourning dove. Only once was the natural silence broken by a car passing by on the county road. The sibilant hum of its tires on the tar surface came out of the distance, drew nearer, then rapidly disappear into the background. Behind me, I could hear Jane scuffing about in the coat closet, which was located right inside the mobile home\u2019s front door.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t feel it when I first sat down, there was a slight chill in the air.\nMy arms began to chill and I seemed to remember the temperature had been 60\u00baF, when I took my morning temperature readings only an hour earlier.\nAfter reminiscing for a moment or two, I took several deep, invigorating breaths and noted a somewhat familiar faint, earthy-sweet scent. At first, the\u00a0odor seemed to carry the fragrance of the woods after a summer\u2019s rain, but there was also the pleasant smell of fresh mown grass, perhaps it came from my having mowed the front lawn the previous day.\nAn itch on the back of my right hand and the tell tale, high pitched whine of a mosquito in my right ear, made me involuntarily swat at the offending insect.\nA moment later, Jane came out the front door to join me. Playfully, she crawled head first down the four front steps, brushing past my left knee and foot as she clambered by. Reaching the ground, she jumped to her feet and ran over to her little red wagon, turned and exclaimed, \u2018I fed ducks, Daddy!\u2019 We chatted for a few moments, whereupon, I stood, stretched and walked back into the warmth of the house. Jane skipped down our stepping stone walkway singing to herself\u2026 and another beautiful summer\u2019s morning had began.\nDonna and Jane visit her father\u2019s family in Indiana\nIn early August, Donna\u2019s father, Don drove from his home in California, to visit with relatives in Freelandville, Indiana. He had intentions of bringing his elderly father, Paul, up to visit with us, but Paul was feeling poorly and wasn\u2019t up to traveling. Since Paul couldn\u2019t come up here, Don asked if we could fly down to visit with them in Freelandville, he offered to pay the air fare. I wasn\u2019t interested in going, but thought it would be a good opportunity for Donna and Jane to visit with her\u00a0side side of the family.\nDonna made plans at True Value Hardware, to take a few days off. Don sent the girls their airplane tickets and $200 dollars for any extra expenses they might incur.\nAt 4:40 AM on Saturday, August 22, we said our \u2018Good byes\u2019 in front of the garage, then Donna and Jane drove off down the driveway thus beginning their trip.\nAbout three hours after leaving home, their flight, aboard a TWA passenger jet left Minneapolis International Airport enroute to St. Louis.\u00a0 This was Jane\u2019s first time off the ground in an airplane. Donna later reported that Jane was wide eyed with wonder at the sight of all the familiar types of things she knew,\u00a0as\u00a0seen from above.\nDon picked the girls up in St. Louis at 9:00 AM and drove them back to his father\u2019s farm near Freelandville. Don had his recreational vehicle set up on his father\u2019s farm and was\u00a0living in it while visiting.\n[1987 photograph: Twin Cities International Airport, Jane looks out the terminal window\u00a0as a 747 passenger jet is loading for flight.]\nMeanwhile at home, I continued with my chores and pursuing my interests as normal, but felt an emptiness, like a great vacancy and disturbing quietness had descended through the house and across the yard.\nOne day while visiting\u00a0in Indiana,\u00a0 Donna and Jane attended a dinner party of about fifty relatives. Don had rented a hall and brought ham for all, the other families brought pot luck dishes, vegetables, etc. The day was spent with every one looking at photograph albums, talking, telling family stories, etc.\u00a0 Jane played with her many cousins.\nA poem I wrote on August 25th:\n\u2018In the Summertime, the faces of their children grew up from the soil,\nTheir smiles echoed the faces of the ripened crops come before.\nCreating small pockets of heightened order from captured energy and entrophied matter,\nthese they\u00a0 handed out with broken limbs, past Winterfall.\nAnd, in the Spring\u2026\nTheir faces were of children grown from the soil whence they came,\nTheir smiles mirroring faces of children gone before.\nTheir many are one, their one are many.\u2019\nIt goes on until the end.\nDon\u00a0visits in his Recreational Vehicle\nAbout two weeks after Donna and Jane returned from their visit with family in Freelandville, Indiana, Don drove up to Minnesota\nto spend the period of September 10 \u2013 September 28\u00a0 visiting with us.\nSix days after arriving, Don suggested we all go camping or on a few day mini-vacation. I telephoned Donna at True Value Hardware and told her vacation plans were in the offing and that she should start making plans at work to get a few days off. Don and I spent about four hours that afternoon planning a nine hundred twenty nine mile trip.\n[Photo at right: This image from the Internet shows the same Dodge Sportsman model Don had, but different exterior paint colors.]\nDescription of the RV\nEarlier in the year, Don bought a used 1972 Dodge Sportsman motor home for $6,000. He put another $1500. into the RV, buying and installing a small color television, a microwave oven,\u00a0 air-conditioner and having some work done on the vehicle\u2019s drive shaft and steering. When the outfitting was done, Don quite literally had a home on wheels.\nThe RV measured twenty four feet long, with an eighteen foot long by eight foot wide living quarters. The exterior of the cab and the body of the aluminum RV were painted white, while a ten inch or so, green stripe ran the length of the vehicle, just below its windows.\nThe RV had a 2500 watt generator for emergency or \u2018off road\u2019 electrical power, but was also wired to run from AC power.\nInside the cab were two, posh swivel chairs, one for the driver the other for a\u00a0 passenger.\nPassanger\u2019s side of the RV interior:\nImmediately behind the cab partition, on the vehicle\u2019s right side was a dinette table with a long \u2018L\u2019 shaped seat extending along two\nsides. Continuing along same side wall while going back, there was the refrigerator with over head cabinets. Next came the microwave oven sitting on a shelf top with cabinets overhead and drawers below. Just beyond the microwave oven was the rear, side entry door.\u00a0 At the back of the RV next to the door was a large closet for hanging clothes. Sharing the back wall, but enclosed in a small room, was the Spartan bathroom with its toilet, sink and shower.\n[The Internet images at left\u00a0are\u00a0from the same Dodge Sportsman model RV as Don had, except in a slightly different floor plan. The idea here is to show how\u00a0we traveled and the amenities at our disposal while 'on the road'.\nContinuing around the wall from the back of the living quarters on the driver\u2019s side:\u00a0Next to the wall partition that enclosed the bathroom, one first encountered the four burner cooking stove, then a counter top working space, followed by a double sink. Located above the stove, counter and sink were cabinets for foods\nand utensils, while below were drawers.\nBetween the sink and the driver\u2019s seat was a long bench. This bench was situated right across the central aisle from the dinette table. Above the bench was a shelf on which Don had bolted the television. The RV living quarters extended\u00a0 out over the cab roof about four feet, providing a \u2018bed, over-cab\u2019 sleeping area.\nThere was a screened window on either side of the living quarters, which allowed passengers at the dinette, or the opposite bench, a good view of the passing terrain. The interior walls were covered with wood grain paneling, while the living quarter floors had sculptured, wall to wall carpeting of cinnamon and white fabric. The bench seats had five inch thick upholstered foam rubber cushions and bolsters. At night the seats and dinette folded down to form sleeping arrangements for six persons.\nSome of the RV's other appliances and amenities included: Aa new 12 inch color TV,\u00a012\u00a0linear feet of overhead cabinets,\u00a0privacy drapes,\u00a0microwave oven,\u00a013 lower drawers and cabinets, hot and cold\u00a0running water,\u00a0air conditioning and heating,\u00a0a large closet\u00a0\u00a0 for hanging clothes,\u00a0a small but complete bathroom,\u00a0a 7 cubic foot gas or electric\u00a0(selectable) refrigerator\u00a0with freezer compartment,\u00a0four burner\u00a0cooking stove with oven (propane),\u00a0 both a fresh\u00a0water and black water holding tank.\nIowa Revisited [7]\nThe circular trip would take us through Iowa to visit the Nineteenth and Twentieth century homes and graves of several of my great grandparents and 2-Great grandparents. During the next forty eight hours there was a flurry of activity around the house as we not only prepared for the logistics of the trip, but put together various documents so we\u2019d know exactly where we were going and to look for when we got there. Several long distance telephone calls were made to genealogists in Iowa, who would be looking for ancestral home locations and Nineteenth century maps, all of which we\u2019d pick up in a couple days, as we drove through Iowa.\nDuring mid afternoon on Friday, 18 September, at the end of her work shift, we picked Donna up at True Value Hardware. As soon as she was in the RV, we pulled out of the parking lot, drove through St. \u00a0 Cloud and turned south toward Iowa.\u00a0 We spent the night in a KOA Campground near the Minnesota-Iowa boarder.\nVisiting the Francis A. Pierce grave\nDuring the morning of Saturday, September 19, as we drove into Iowa, the recreational vehicle was filled with the sound of talking, the squeaks and creaks of the vehicles body, the muted roar of the tires on the road. Within me was a private, hushed silence, for we were soon to arrive at the previous home and graves of my Pierce Great grandparents, near Lawler, Chickasaw County, Iowa.\nComing over the crest of a hill, we saw the small town of Lawler, spread out in a shallow valley. My Great grandparents, Francis Albert Pierce and Lydia Amanda Sabin were buried only a mile and a half northwest of Lawler.\nWe drove up Benz Street to the North Lawler Cemetery and located Francis and Amanda\u2019s grave site more or less in the center of the cemetery. The cemetery was bordered on two side by corn fields and had a patch of wood on the back side. Later in the day, we found that until 1985, the North Lawler Cemetery and two other old cemeteries had been allowed to grow wild, without any lawn care or other maintenance. That explained why the grass in the cemetery looked like a mix of herbaceous broadleaf\u2019s and grass\u2013until recently, weeds and saplings had grown wild obscuring the markers.\n[Site of Jacksonville,\u00a0Chickasaw Co., IA. Located about 1-1/4 mi\u00a0north of the\u00a019th Century,\u00a0Francis A. Pierce farm. The\u00a0school Glen K. Pierce attended as a child, is seen as the white structure\u00a0at far\u00a0left.]\nFrancis A. Pierce, had one of the most prominent markers of the approximately one hundred grave stones in the cemetery. The six foot high, gray granite family monument had a top that was carved to resembled four gabled roof. Lydia\u2019s obituary said she was buried in the family plot with her first husband, Francis and indeed we found their two smaller head stones. I was sad to see that Lydia\u2019s name was never inscribed on the larger, family monument, never-the-less, many years before her own death she\u2019d had inscribed on her husband\u2019s marker,\n\u2018GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN\u2019.\nI would like to have had the time to spread a blanket on the grass in front of the Pierce family grave marker and sat for awhile. I would like to have had some quiet time alone to reach within myself and segregate my principle parts, to commune with that 12% of me that was still Francis and Amanda.\nDriving back to Lawler, we asked a gas station attendant for directions to \u2018old Jacksonville\u2019 and found that another three miles north, past North Cemetery on Benz Street, then about a half mile to the west, was a place now called, \u2018Five Corners.\u2019 As the attendant explained, \u2018There used to be a small town there, but now it\u2019s just a junction where there are five gravel roads going off this way and that through the corn fields. There is some kind of a small museum and park at the crossroads. People go there for picnics, but I think it\u2019s closed now.\u2019\nMy grandfather, Glen Pierce, attended elementary school in a small school house atJacksonville.\nOld Jacksonville\nWe drove out into the country side following the instructions given by the gas station attendant and our Iowa state map. Turning west off Benz Street, at the roads \u2018T\u2019, we followed a narrow gravel road a little less than a half mile to the top of a low hill where we came to \u2018Five Corners\u2019.\nWhile Don parked the RV, the rest of us climbed out to stretch our legs and survey the surroundings. Between the road segments that ran NW and SW from the junction, there was a several acre triangle of land dedicated as the \u2018Adolph MunsonPark\u2019. A large sign with yellow lettering on a brown background stood facing the five cornered intersection stating, \u2018Jacksonville, Iowa 1854 \u2013 1888\u2019\nThe park was bordered by a weathered, old (modern vintage) gray split rail fence. In the park stood several original buildings fromJacksonvilleand vicinity. We walked around the old buildings looking in through their windows: There was a small, turn-of-the-century general store which had become a museum filled with antiques. The log cabin was brought in from elsewhere in the county and professionally reassembled in its new home. Lastly, was the nicely whitewashed, one room school house. The school building had originally set a few hundred yards away, along the gravel road we\u2019d just come down, but was moved into the park and set on the still intact foundation that once housed The Jacksonville Republican newspaper.\n.\nPhotos above. (L) Interior of Jacksonville school, facing front. Photograph by Robert F. Pierce taken in 1989. (R) Interior of Jacksonville school, facing rear. My mother, Hazel M. Pierce looks about. Grandfather Glen received his lower education in this room.]\nI walked out into the center of the gravel intersection and oriented my 1894 Chickasaw County map. Facing due south, I looked down a gentle, long hill which rose slightly about a mile away.\u00a0 Fields of tall Iowa corn grew on either side of the road for as far as the eye could see. The southern horizon was a long low ridge about two and a half miles away. Between the hill, upon which I now stood, and that ridge, lay the land on which the Pierce family lived for some thirty years during the late 19th century. Their lives, toil and emotions all played out on the land located between these two low hills.\nI gulped nervously and shifted my weight while peering down the road, lost in thought, searching for the images of another time. In my mind\u2019s eye welled up the image of a buck board with the Pierce family coming to town; then of my young, grandfather, walking and skipping homeward from elementary school, turning his head briefly to watch a grasshopper fly up. I wondered how many countless times the family members had been in town, then starting for home, passed through that very spot where I stood and saw the same land configurations and I saw.\nReturning to the RV, we drove about one and a half miles south on the gravel road where we came to the northeast boarder of the 19th Century, Francis A. Pierce farm. The farm sat on the backbone of a long low hill; the land was beautiful and rich in agricultural resources. The current owners had the fields primarily planted to corn, while some acreage was in hay and some lay fallow. The farmstead buildings were near the lowest point of the property, at the northeast corner.\nExtending along the road for a couple hundred feet and acting as shade and a wind break were a line of tall evergreens. Perpendicular to the road, and extending about six hundred feet was a line of old hardwood trees that protected the farmstead buildings from north and easterly winds.\n[Francis A. &\u00a0 Lydia (Sabin) Pierce farm. West (left) to Northwest panorama of the property owned by Francis Albert Pierce and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 family from\u00a0 the late 1800s. Jacksonville (Five Corners) is up the road to the right, about 1-1/2\u00a0miles.]\nStories from the Francis A. Pierce farm\nI recalled reading in Francis\u2019s obituary, that he and wife, Lydia Amanda Sabin, had carved their farm out of native prairie. Great-grandfather, Francis, and his family were the first civilized people, the first Europeans, perhaps the first humans ever to cultivate the one hundred sixty acres we were about to see.\u00a0 The Francis A. Pierce family consisted of Francis and Amanda, their eldest son Francis Jr. (Frank), twin girls, Myrtle and Gertrude (Gertie) and the youngest son, my grandfather, Glen Kenyon. When Francis Sr. died in his fifties, Amanda remained on the farm raising the children. When the youngsters were grown, she sold the farm, moved locally and subsequently remarried.\nDon stopped the RV at the old Pierce farmstead driveway. Donna and I climbed down and walked about seventy five feet up the driveway toward a figure who was bent over, working in the engine of\u00a0a recent model car.\nAn older, middle aged man in his late fifties straightened up and watched us approach while frowning suspiciously. I introduced Donna and myself and told the weather beaten gentleman that I was descended from an earlier owner of the property and that if he had a few minutes to share we would like to ask some questions about the old homestead. After chatting for a few minutes, the farmer began to relax where upon he introduced himself as Harold, grandson of the\u00a0man who had, in the time of Francis A. Pierce, owned an adjoining property immediately the north\u00a0 of the Pierce farm [8] .\nThe white haired, ruddy-red faced Irishman said that, the Pierce house was torn down and the current house constructed on the same site in 1924.\nHarold invited us into his house where he motioned for us to sit at the kitchen table. His wife joined us and we all began chatting. During the conversation, Harold left the room for a few moments and returned with two books, a brittle scrap book and an old photograph album. When he sat the old books on the table, a silverfish darted out from the binding of the scrapbook, turned and scurried back inside for safety.\nWhile opening the scrap book, Harold told us that \u2018It was left to me by my old maid aunt who died at the age of 95, a few year ago.\u2019\nFor a moment I lost track of the conversation, thinking,\n\u2018If Harold\u2019s aunt was 95 years old a few years ago, that means she was born perhaps 98 years ago. My grandfather, Glen K. Pierce, was born 100 years ago last June 4 (1887). So, Glen and Harold\u2019s \u2018old maid aunt\u2019 had been only a year or two apart in age, they lived on adjoining farms, they certainly\u00a0 knew one another, undoubtedly walked to school together and played together as children!\u2019\nHarold\u2019s aunt had collected newspaper articles relating to the birth, marriage and death of many persons whom she knew from the early day in old Jacksonville. While browsing through the scrapbook, I found the Death Notice for my grandfather, Glen, dated 1958, and one for his sister Gertrude Pierce-Uglum.\nMeanwhile, Harold was thumbing through the old photograph album. When he found what he was looking for, he handed me the album stating, \u2018Here\u2019s a picture of the Pierce house.\u2019 I gulped in guarded excitement as I drew the picture\u2019s image into memory. The photograph had been taken from atop the farm yard\u2019s old wooden windmill, which\u00a0previously stood\u00a0two hundred feet southwest of the house, in the exact same location as Harold\u2019s\u00a0current windmill (built in the 1930s).\nThe Pierce two story, white, wood frame farmhouse had no basement, but was built on a field stone foundation. When the house was torn down in 1924, a small addition on the end of the house was salvaged and moved one hundred fifty feet west into the barnyard where it was used as a chicken coop for over half a century, before being burned in circa 1984.\nDuring our conversations, Harold suddenly threw back his head in laughter as he recalled a story, a story told him many years ago by his now deceased aunt. Harold said (paraphrased), \u2018When she was a little girl, she was over at the Pierce\u2019s when one of the boys, (pause) Glen, climbed the wooden windmill. Then, holding onto the wooden blades, he began to rotate with the propeller. Round and round he went, upside down one minute and right side up the next.\u2019\n[Heirloom\u00a0 photograph: Francis A. and Lydia (Sabin) Pierce home, ca 1923. Photo taken from\u00a0the windmill tower shortly before the old house was demolished by the farms new\u00a0 owners.]\nGlen\u2019s childhood deed was daring, funny and memorable. I was amazed that the story remained in memory for these last ninety years. At the same time, realizing that when I subsequently retold the story to my daughter, Jane, it would be an image evoking memory sake of her great-grandfather, Glen Pierce, for still a longer period of time.\nSeeing our excitement, Harold left the kitchen again and returned with the farms old Title of Abstract. I was becoming overwhelmed by the amount and the rate at which information was being presented. I asked Harold if he\u2019d so kind as to make photocopies of some of the papers he had shown us and if I could borrow the photo of the Pierce house.\n[ca 1899 Heirloom\u00a0photograph:\u00a0Francis Jr. and my paternal grandfather, Glen K Pierce (standing) by \u2018the Silver Maple\u2019. (?)]\nI gasped in shocked surprise when Harold\u00a0 reached forward and simply removed the photograph from the album and handed it to me while agreeing to make photocopies of the other items I\u2019d asked for.\nWhen we about to leave, we\u2019d all stepped outside when Harold told a touching story which gave an insight into the character of Great grandmother Lydia Amanda Sabin. Harold said, (paraphrased), \u2018For years after my family bought the farm, Mrs. Pierce\u00a0 would\u00a0 stop by on occasion and ask to look at a Silver Maple that she and her husband planted when they first bought the land. The tree was on the north side of the house (gesturing over his shoulder).\nI lapsed into thought for a moment, wondering if the Silver Maple was the same tree we have a in a heirloom family photograph. In the picture, son Francis Jr. (Frank) is seen seated in a chair and young Glen is standing, both are leaning against an approximately fifteen to twenty year old tree whose bark appears to be Maple. Harold continued, \u2018The large, sprawling tree was damaged by severe winds during the 1970s and had to be cut down.\u2019 As we walked back out along the driveway, I glanced back into the yard and could see all that remained of the tree was a slight, grass filled depression in the yard where the stump was removed.\nThat evening around 6:30 PM, we stopped at a Pizza Hut in Waverly, Iowa for a pizza and beer. As we hurried across the parking lot, a squall line passed over us and a downpour followed.\nWhereas, downtown Waverly appeared deserted, Pizza Hut\u00a0 was packed with college age students and young families. It had been overcast, humid and warm all day so we were all feeling a little uncomfortable and dehydrated. The smell of baking pizza crust, cheese, baking vegetables and tomato sauce set our appetites on fire. We ordered a large Super Supreme pizza with a thin crust and glasses of cold beer.\nAround 9:30 PM, we pulled into a KOA Campground at Story City, a few miles north of Ames,Iowa to spend the night. Don paid the $12.50 fee for a parking space, with water, sewage and electric utilities hook ups. We were so exhausted after a full day of driving and sightseeing, that everyone was in bed by 10:00 PM and asleep shortly thereafter.\nEarly morning thoughts: genes, Lydia\nI awoke at4:00 AM, got up for a bathroom run, then returned to my bed above the RV cab. Dim illumination from a park security lamp entered through the curtains, allowing me to make out shapes in the darkness.\nDon, \u2018Grandpa,\u2019 was asleep in his sleeping bag on the cushions of the pulled out kitchenette table\u2019s seat bench. Donna was asleep in her goose down bag on a fold down berth several feet above the table. Jane was snuggled in her goose down bag on the pull out bench seat between the sink and the driver\u2019s seat. Other than for an occasional snore, the motor home was immersed in silence.\nInstead of returning to sleep, I laid drowsily in my sleeping bag, thinking about Great-grandfather Francis, grandfather Glen, my father, Robert, and myself.\nI was\u00a0attempting to recognize the genetic predisposition\u2019s, abilities and sense of order we shared. I wondered about the natural abilities that Francis used in building his house and farm. I sought the quiet strength and sense of order that led Glen into the profession of engineering and finally to his retirement fruit farm near Coloma, Michigan.\nIn my mind\u2019s eye there formed small iconic images of Francis, Glen, Robert and myself. We were aligned vertically\u00a0 in chronological order. I could see that there were related predisposition\u2019s up and down the generations. To this group, were then added images of the descendants of Glen Pierce, all of whom I personally knew. The family was seen floating in pyramidal shaped family tree with Francis and Amanda at the top and our most recent generation along the base of the pyramid.\nSuddenly, in my semi awake state, several of the images became animated, each displaying a similar predisposition or inherited trait. Then, one after another, shared characteristics were seen cascading down the generations like illuminated pin balls that spreading out through the widening family structure. However, as each characteristic coursed through the family, not every person was animated (or illuminated) by that particular trait. While several generations shared a trait, that trait became masked or muted for a generation, only to arise as a full blown characteristic in a later generation. The spotty way in which the characteristics were passed from one to another person, brought to mind the idea of probability cloud. Traits showed up at seemingly random locations within the related group but with greater density than they would be found in a not immediately related group.\nI knew there was a large \u2018genetic current\u2019 feeding into the images from the husbands and wives who had married into this family line across the generations.\nThe animated images faded from my mind, only to be replaced by the realization that when we think of our ancestors as separate, non connected, individuals, we are inexplicably, but falsely, isolating one another in space-time. In reality we are not only connected, we are literally and paradoxically, one another by degree, we are very close reproduction-manifestations of an essentially immortal gene code.\nA family is the\u00a0leading edge of the\u00a0gene mix. A family exists in a space-time location where clusters of shared genetic predisposition\u2019s exist in their highest probability. Our genes sprout a new \u2018carrier-breeder\u2019 from materials they find in the natural\u00a0 environment. We\u00a0as individuals call the mobile carrier,\u00a0\u2018my body\u2019. So, this body and it\u2019s physical and socio-intellectual cerebral function becomes the individual manifestation of our genetic humanity. Those individual manifestations called, Francis, Glen, Robert, Larry and Jane all carry very, very similar\u00a0recombinant characteristics\u2013 it was these blocks of similarity that I sought.\nAs time passed, and in the quiet, darkness of the RV, I continued thinking about the previous day\u2019s events:\nBefore this trip, all that I knew about my Great grandmother Lydia Amanda Sabin-Pierce, was taken from a single photograph I had of her; the photograph showed a friendly and pleasant\u00a0 looking, older, matronly woman.\nWhen Harold _\u00a0told us that over the years, Mrs. Pierce had periodically returned to the farm to see and stand by the Silver Maple tree that she and her deceased husband, Francis planted, I knew her. I immediately understood Lydia as a loving, devoted mother, helpmate and wife. I saw a person who carried the memory of personal commitment and her first marriage to the end of her own life.\nLydia never knew, how could she, that her innocuous, private and personal pilgrimages back to the farm would be recalled a century later. The memory of her unyielding devotion and the words, \u2018GONE \u00a0BUT \u00a0NOT \u00a0FORGOTTEN\u2019 engraved on her husband\u2019s monument, have continued to exist in that area and now with special meaning in the memories of her family. In a moment of introspection, I wondered if my idea for this sentimental trip to Iowa, derived from the same predisposition that led Lydia back to the farm and \u2018their Silver Maple\u2019, a multi generational sense of romanticism.\nThe Grubb home in Grand Junction\nSunday, September 20, was another busy day that started for our traveling group at6:00 AM and lasted until late that night.\nDuring mid morning we drove into Grand Junction, Iowa.\nGrand Junction was the town where my Great grandparents, George\u00a0and Anna (Annie) Flora (Anderson) Grubb \u00a0lived for many years into the early decades of the 20th Century. It was here that they\u00a0raised their family including my youthful grandmother, Elsie Grubb.\nElsie Grubb grew up, met Glen Kenyon Pierce while they both were attending the University of Iowa and were later married. Glen was the lad who rode the windmill propellers on his parent\u2019s farm, the farm we visited the previous day.\nThe neighborhood surrounding central Grand Junction, was made up of old two story, white wood frame houses, all set back from the road on large lots. The wide streets were lined with tall, stately hardwood trees, whose branches extended out above the road to create an arching canopy.\nGrand Junction had once been a bustling Midwestern town. It blossomed with the growth of agricultural production in Iowa and expansion of railroad service into the American west.\nThe town\u2019s two to three block long business district consisted of a wide street with turn of the century brick buildings. Each building had its own character, all of which denoted past affluence. There were carved stone scrolls and brick designs at the top of the buildings and below the roofs. There were brick arches above windows and doorways, there were patterns created from differently shaded inlaid brick, but this was all from Grand Junctions heyday, in the latter half of the 19th Century.\nThe two story, brick City Hall, once the pride of Grand Junction, stood in the edge of the business district, it\u2019s windows boarded up, it\u2019s belfry dismantled, the bell removed.\nThe sidewalks through town had become grossly unleveled. Long fissures in the concrete were seen running this way and that, while weeds and grass grew wild from the cracks. Along the sidewalk, tall weeds had taken hold and grew from the tiny space between the sidewalk and the building fronts.\nSeveral of the downtown business\u2019s windows were boarded up, while other buildings were simply deserted and vacant. Walking along the main street through town, I saw checkered paint, fading colors, bare wood, faded and unused window shades still drawn in upper story windows, unclean gutters, weeds, and mostly empty buildings. The town was not dirty, run down or dilapidated like a city ghetto, but was honorably deteriorating with age, like an old pair of comfortable slippers that have been in service past their usefulness.\nReturning to the RV, we checked an early Twentieth Century, Grand Junction street map to locate the house lot where George and\u00a0 Anna lived.\nA few moments later, when we turned onto Railroad Avenue, I stepped down from the motor home and walked alone. It was a mere half block walk along the sidewalk on the north side of the street before I came to a vacant lot that was filled with low weeds. Although the lot on which the Grubb house stood measured about one hundred fifty feet wide by two hundred feet deep, the family owned several consecutive lots along the street and thereby owned nearly one side of the entire block. At the back of the property and extending out perhaps a quarter mile was a cornfield.\nApproaching the home site, I could feel my heart beating with anticipation. For so many decades George and Anna\u2019s two story house had stood in the lot, but by the time I had come to visit, where the house had stood, there now existed only a large irregular square of dark soil. It was unsettling to see how all the attention, love and labor that went into making this location a prosperous home was now erased from the environment.\n[Journal drawing looking along Railroad Ave. The sidewalk to the old Grubb house cane be seen where there is a long whish of brown leading to the right, from the sidewalk. The location where the front of the house stood can been seen in the rectangular geometry of brown discoloration of the soil-cut weeds.]\nStanding on the public sidewalk in front of where the house had been, I looked about. Before me was the dark soil and a slight depression where a concrete sidewalk once led to the George and Annie\u2019s front porch. Great grandmother had spent many hours of her life tending flowers along the sidewalk, immediately in front of the spot where I now stood.\nI recalled something my elderly cousin, Doris Grubb-Hughes, wrote about her memories of Anna:\n[Carrying forward from the previous drawing. We've walked down the overgrown sidewalk and stopped, turned to the right and are\u00a0looking up the sidewalk, and back in time 70 years to see the family\u00a0posing for their picture on the homes front steps.\nPhotograph above, the\u00a0George E.\u00a0and Anna Flora Grubb family, ca 1917.\u00a0Part of extended Grubb family sitting on front steps the Grand Junction home discussed in this text.\nL>R top rear: Edward Grubb (son), Elsie Grubb-Pierce (daughter),\u00a0George E. Grubb Sr. (father)\nL>R\u00a0\u00a0middle row: Marie Heggi-Grubb (their daughter-in-law) with daughter Margaret, Anna Flora\u00a0Anderson-Grubb (mother)\u00a0with baby grandson (my Uncle Bill) William Pierce on lap, Glen K.\u00a0\u00a0Pierce (their son-in-law, my grandfather).\nFront:\u00a0 Dorothy Grubb (granddaughter, who later in life was my 5th grade math teacher)]\n\u2019\u2026Annie rose very early on summer mornings, donned stockings on arms to protect skin, and worked outside in her flowers. Along the sidewalk leading to the main walk were California poppies\u2026always beside the steps leading to the porch were pansies\u2026they were surely hard on neighborhood kids that might skate by on their roller skates (and damage the flowers)\u2019\nBeside me and continuing down the block in either direction was the public sidewalk overgrown with weeds and buckled after generations without repair.\nI began browsing around on the property and found a narrow concrete sidewalk that was covered by three fourths inch of soil, weed detritus and grass. This length of sidewalk once led to the Grubb\u2019s \u2018back (side) porch\u2019. Cousin Doris wrote of that porch, as she recalled 50 year old images from her younger years, \u2018\u2026I mostly remember Grandpa at home, working outside, mixing up stuff on the enclosed back porch and carrying pails of it, slightly stooped\u2026\u2019\nMy Great grandfather, George Grubb died in 1938, four years before my birth, yet between cousin Doris\u2019 memories and my standing on that practically buried walkway, the previous half century practically collapsed in my mind\u2019s eye.\nIn a flash of imagination, I saw my great grandfather, a tall, thin, balding man, who had years earlier retired from the rail road and grown old. He was backing out the porch door carrying a bucket in each hand. The porch door swung shut with a thin sounding \u2018slam\u2019 and George came down the steps, turned and walked up the\u00a0 sidewalk toward and right through me\u2026over fifty years earlier.\nGrandmother, Elsie Grubb-Pierce, once told me of an event that occurred here: When referring to her father, George Grubb, Elsie said, (paraphrased), \u2018He had a terrible temper. Once when he was going to spank me, I climbed out the bedroom window onto the porch roof, scooted down a trellis next to the porch support and ran over to a neighbor\u2019s until he cooled down.\u2019\nThe Grubb\u2019s house had burned, its basement was back filled with soil. The fruit trees and flower beds the family grew and tended, the house where Grandmother Elsie Grubb-Pierce was raised were all gone now.\nDonna and I walked to a nearby house to speak with several adults who\u2019d stepped out on their side lawn. We introduced ourselves and told of my relationship with the George and Anna Grubb who had lived in the currently vacant lot next door. An elderly\u00a0 gentleman in the group appraised Donna and myself before speaking. Then we learned, the people we were talking to, were members of the Hillman family who had been one of the town founders a hundred fifty years ago. Over the generations, the Hillman\u2019s were involved in a variety of local business\u2019.\nDoing most of the talking, was the animated, ninety two year old, Mr. Hillman, who alternately leaned on his cane and waved it in the air as he spoke of the Grubb family and their house, saying,\n\u2018I recall an instance in 1918 when one of the children died during the Flu epidemic, that the Misses, Mrs. Grubb, came over to the house to help out during the families bereathment.\u2019\nHe continued,\n\u2018In its day the Grubb\u2019s had one of the show place houses in Grand Junction. They had lots of trees and shrubs on the property\u2026After she died, the house was rented out. Then it went downhill. Neither the landlord or the renters did anything to keep the place up. Finally the roof got bad and water started to get in, so no one lived in the house\u2026\u2019\nWe were told that the house burned down in 1984 or \u201985 and the basement was back filled a year later. Indeed, all that remained of this place were the notations on an old map, some family photographs, the memories and stories passed down by the older members of our family.\nAfter thanking the Hillman\u2019s for the time and information they gave us, we walked back to the RV and left Grand Junction looking for the town cemetery.\nGrand Junction Cemetery\nTwo miles west of town, on Highway E53, we found the Grand Junction Cemetery. The people who made Grand Junction a modern and up to date town during the late 19th and early 20th century were all there, their resting place as fine and modestly grand as the town they built had its self once been.\nThe graves of George and Anna Flora Anderson- Grubb were located on the east side of the cemetery, next to a large cornfield. Their family marker was a reddish-purple granite stone standing about two and a half feet high with an overall width of about four feet.\nWhen Jane began climbing on George and Anna\u2019s headstone stone, I called her down and began to explain what the marker stood for and our need to respect\u00a0 their resting place. While talking, I suddenly realized that if George and Anna knew their 2G-grand daughter, Jane, was climbing on their marker, they would probably have told me to let her play. The twenty five percent of me that is George and Anna, told their twelve and a half percent composite, which has become Jane, \u2018Go ahead and play, but don\u2019t get hurt.\u2019.\nSunday, September 20th was turning out to be one of those Fall days where if you wore a sweater it was too warm and if you didn\u2019t, it was too cold.\u00a0 By noon, the sun was just beginning to show itself\u00a0 and small patches of sky could be seen amongst the fast moving cumulus clouds.\nMargaret Grubb-Frantz\nAfter lunch, we visited briefly with my elderly, seventy seven year old cousin Margaret Grubb-Frantz and her husband Leon Frantz. Margaret was the granddaughter of George and Anna Grubb, her sister Dorothy Grubb-Mount was my Fifth Grade mathematics teacher at Amphitheater School in Tucson, Arizona. (see youthful Margaret, leaning next to her mother,\u00a0in the Grubb family photograph above).\nThe Frantz\u2019s were obviously literate people. Decades earlier, Leon had been a successful hog auctioneer and gentleman farmer, as well as Mayor of Grand Junction for ten years. The Frantz\u2019s sold their rural properties a couple decades earlier and were living in a modern, split level house in Grand Junction. There were books in evidence about the living room, including several thick religious books on an end table.\nI noted that Margaret and Leon, as well as the Hillman family were all dressed in their Sunday clothes. The women were in nice, understated dresses; while the men wore white shirts, neck ties and quality vintage suits. They were all dressed from having attended church, an activity that is often second nature in small town America. Each was carrying on a custom they had learned as children, in the early decades of this 20th Century. These people had been, as children, the friends and relatives of George Grubb and Anna Flora Anderson-Grubb.\nAs we talked, Margaret said of Anna Grubb\u00a0(her grandma),\n\u2018She liked to have her way a lot. She was particular and tended to detail. Once they (George and Anna) had an argument and she went to bed for two weeks to teach him a lesson\u2026\u2019\nA while later, referring to George Grubb, Margaret said fondly,\n\u2018He was kind of gruff and liked to tease the grandkids.\u2019\nMargaret went into a back room and returned to loan me a 1914-15 photograph of George and Anna, as well as her childhood family sitting on the front steps of the Grubb house in Grand Junction (seen above).\nShortly thereafter, as we prepared to leave the Frantz home, Margaret and I hugged, looked into each other\u2019s eyes and said our good-byes. That was the first and only\u00a0time Margaret and I ever met, yet, it filled the two of us with a moment of sentiment. When we wished each other well, I had a lump in my throat and saw small tears in the corner of her eyes.\nA few years later I received a letter from my Dad, informing me that Margaret had\u00a0 passed away; Leon followed Margaret a few\nmonths later\u2026and another generation was gone\nJefferson Cemetery\nThe next leg of our journey took us to nearby Jefferson, Iowa where we spoke for a half an hour with genealogy researcher,\u00a0Shirley Ross.\nJust before leaving Minnesota, we telephoned Mrs. Ross, whom was a long time member of the Greene County Historical Society, and asked her to find some information that we\u2019d pick up a few days later as we toured Iowa. We were looking for the location of a farm owned by Harmon and Margaret Anderson, (my 2 great grandparents) the parents of Anna Flora Anderson-Grubb, whose now vacant homesite we\u2019d just visited in Grand Junction.\nMrs. Ross exceeded our expectations by locating not only the Harmon Anderson farm, but other properties that\u00a0he owned later, in Scranton; she found\u00a0Harmon\u2019s Estate Probate papers as well as other information relating to the Harmon Anderson family.\nOur next stop in Jefferson was at the Jefferson Cemetery. About seventy five feet inside from the main gate, the cemetery drive came to a \u2018T\u2019 at the base of a statue. The approximately life size statue of a Civil War soldier stood atop an eight foot high concrete pedestal. I thought the statue fitting, particularly in the graveyard; for Harmon Anderson was a Civil War veteran and had been a Prisoner of War at Georgia\u2019s infamous Andersonville stockade.\n[Photo at right. Me, standing near Harmon Anderson's family monument in Jefferson cemetery.]\nOn the northwest side of the cemetery, we found the monument and family burial plot of my paternal 2G-grandparents Harmon\u00a0 and Margaret (Horney) Anderson, parents of Anna Flora (Anderson) Grubb. The Anderson\u2019s eight foot tall gray granite marker was one of the tallest and most ornate monuments in its vicinity.\nWe cleaned, then chalked the monument in order to make the engraved inscriptions stand out more clearly, then as we had done\nwith the other family grave markers encountered on the trip, photographed the monument for our family archives.\nHarmon Anderson\u2019s Iowa farm\nLate that afternoon, we found the farm property Harmon, Margaret and family had bought for $480 on 10 July 1868. The one hundred sixty acre tract was located about five miles south southwest of Jefferson, on the south side of Iowa Highway E53.\nWhen the Harmon Anderson family moved to Iowa from Spring Valley, Ohio and bought the property, my great grandmother Anna Flora was only seven years old!\nAt the old farm site, we stopped the RV to look across the fields of ripened corn. And in doing so, saw the same geographical and sky conformations my ancestors saw ever day for the eleven years they lived on the property. In the late 1860s, that area had been prairie, dotted by small agricultural fields. As the decades passed and technology improved the fields became larger and larger, to a point where as far as you could see there were now crops. The land was prosperous and had proven fruitful for those who settled here permanently.\nWe stopped at the modern farmhouse that sat on the property.\nNext to the driveway was a sign stating that the farm was listed in the Iowa State Registry as a \u2018Century Farm\u2019, meaning it had been in the same family for at least one hundred years. An old, gray haired gentleman, in his sixties, working about the yard stopped to watch us, so we climbed down from the RV, walked up the driveway and introduced our selves.\nI was pleasantly surprised that this man was Mr. Graven, grandson of Clark Graven who brought the farm from Harmon and Margaret in 1879! Mr. Graven told us that his father had told him that (paraphrased),\n\u2018The previous owners, the Anderson\u2019s, had a T shaped log cabin on the same site as their house [9] . My grandfather, Clark, lived in the Anderson cabin after purchasing the land.\u2019 The Graven\u2019s present house, built in 1951 was the second house their family had built on the same exact location.\nThe farmhouse and out buildings, sat on a slight rise along the slope of a long gentle hill, situated about one hundred fifty feet from the passing highway. From their cabin\u2019s location, the Anderson family could look out over their prairie land and see from the southeast around to the southwest.\nMr. Graven said he was\u00a0harvesting one hundred eighty bushels of corn and forty bushels of soybeans per acre from the land and that it was recently appraised at $800 and $1000 per acre\u00a0at a time when agricultural land\u00a0prices were depressed.\n[Heirloom family photograph:\u00a0Inside Harmon and Margaret (Horney) Anderson cabin home, rural Jefferson, IA, ca. 15 January 1875: Son,\u00a0Willie, lies in state, his sisters and brother look on (L>R): Elizabeth,\u00a0\u2665 Anna Flora, James.]\nWe chatted with Mr. Graven for about twenty minutes then returned to the RV and turned back out onto the highway.\nA quarter of a mile west of the farmhouse, we came to an intersection between Highway E57 and County Road 18. In the southwest corner, now a cornfield, there once stood a frontier school house. Anna, her brothers, sisters and neighboring children walked there for their schooling between 1868 and 1879.\nMr. Graven had just told us, \u2018The school house is long gone, but the water well is reputed to still exist.\u2019 Indeed, all traces of the school, save the remnants of a hand water pump, had been plowed into the field.\nThe images of children of hurrying to and from school along the rutted wagon trails, of great grandmother Anna Flora Anderson walking to and from school with her siblings, the sounds of children calling to one another, all lay hidden amongst the tall, golden, silent stalks of corn.\nVisiting Scranton, Iowa\nVery late in the afternoon, we arrived in Scranton, a nearby town, where Harmon and the family moved several years prior Harmon\u2019s death. Scranton was only about two thirds the size of Grand\u00a0Junction, having a business district only two blocks long and composted of about 8 to 10 brick buildings on either side of a wide street. It\u2019s buildings, unlike Grand Junction, were mostly only one story tall and lacked the stylized flourishes evident\u00a0of a town that has seen solid growth and a\u00a0period of\u00a0affluence.\nScranton was a sleepy town. Other than for a single, old man sitting on a sidewalk bench two blocks away, the village seemed deserted.\nA block from the center of town, and in the same block as once stood Scranton\u2019s City Hall, Harmon owned six of the eight city lots. All but one of the lots contained old and well kept, white, two story wood frame houses each surrounded by large, stately deciduous trees.\nHarmon, like so many others of that area and of the late 1870s was heavily involved in land speculation. Our genealogical assistant, Mrs. Ross had told us, \u2018 Generally, the people who arrived in a developing settlement bought up the land, speculating the area would continue to draw people and grow, hoping to make a relatively fast and handsome profit.\u2019 I caught the term \u2018speculating\u2019 and realized immediately that Harmon and I shared at least\u00a0this one common trait, he with land, myself with precious metals bullion and stocks.\nFollowing the 1896 Plat Map eight blocks west of town, we found a six acre tract that Harmon owned and which Mrs. Ross thought was where the Anderson family lived after they sold the farm to Clark Graven and moved into town. There was no longer a house on the property, the land had become home to the not very large or prosperous looking, Scranton Manufacturing Company.\nWe drove back into Scranton and turned onto the main street on our way out of town. A few blocks north from the center of town, we found ourselves suddenly in the country, surrounded by Iowa\u2019s ever present cornfields. We drove on, quietly talking amongst ourselves, everyone was tired and beginning to hunger after a full day of sightseeing.\nNear the western horizon, the sky was filled with dark clouds whose upper most surfaces were illuminated with a soft white glow by the setting sun. Looking out across the fields toward the south, I noted that every few miles there were tall grain elevators located along the rail road tracks. We were\u00a0 in the midst of the U.S. corn belt, a place of truly mighty food production.\nIt was dark when we reached Carroll, Iowa. We considered ourselves fortunate to find a Bonanza Steak restaurant, now quite hungry we stopped to eat. We all ordered the same meal, consisting of: soup, a plate pf goods from the salad bar, a\u00a0baked potato with sour cream, grilled French bread, a sirloin tip steak, ice tea and a bowl of vanilla ice-cream for dessert.\nDon\u2019s hilarious story\nAfter supper we resumed our drive, this time proceeding north, while looking for a campground in which to spend the night. Everyone was full, contented and beginning to relax, when suddenly, Don announced that\u00a0he had a story to tell. It was\u00a0about an event that had just occurred in the bathroom at the Bonanza restaurant.\nDon continued, as we all sat listening to the story unfold:\n\u2018I was sitting on the commode having a major poop when I passed a fart of such horrid smell that it ranked as one of the worst I ever let. Just then, two fellas came into the bathroom to use the urinal. One guy said to the other, \u2018Boy the ventilation is poor in here!\u2019 The second man, sounding about seventy years old, steps up to the urinal and said, \u2018That\u2019s the trouble with these places, the ventilation fans don\u2019t work too good.\u2019 The first man wouldn\u2019t wait for his friend, saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you outside!\u2019 Meanwhile, the old man at the urinal began squeezing off farts while he tried to pee.\nI sat on the toilet, one of those tall uncomfortable, paraplegic toilets, contemplating my own poop and listening to the old man fart, but laughing to myself, knowing there wasn\u2019t a fart in the world thick enough to cover my odor. I laughed so hard after they left I could hardly wipe my butt.\u2019\nOn we drove through the darkness, with Don recounting portions of his story. Donna, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was doubled over, clutching her stomach while screaming with laughter. My sides ached and tears rolling down my cheeks as I gasped for breath between fits of laughing. Don\u2019s revenge on people who fart in public bathrooms was one of the funniest stories we\u2019d heard in a long time!\nAt 8:50 PM, we found a place to set up the RV in Black Hawk State Park, by 9:30 PM we were all in bed.\nThe trip home\nMonday, September 21 found us on the final return leg of our mini vacation.\nOver the next two days we stopped and toured several parks in Minnesota including, Blue Mounds SP, Split Rock SP, Upper Sioux Agency SP and Pipestone National Park.\nBlue Mounds State Park was created around a prairie hill that gently rose from the surrounding plains, only to terminate on its southern slope in\u00a0the sheer drop on ninety foot\u00a0 cliff. In by-gone times, the Indians chased buffalo up the incline, over the innocent looking hill crest to the \u2018buffalo jump\u2019. We took the one and a half mile nature trail from the Interpretive Center to the \u2018buffalo jump\u2019, walking through some of the only remaining native prairie in Minnesota.\nWe stopped early that afternoon, to set up the motor home at a KOA campground near Pipestone National Park. We\u2019d been driving hard and doing a lot of sightseeing during the last few days so it was nice to take a break, stretch our legs and lounge around for a while. By late afternoon, the sky became over cast and a chill set ins. While Donna prepared supper, I sat at the kitchenette chatting with her, writing a post card to\u00a0friends and watching the Evening TV News. Meanwhile, Don and Jane, wearing their jackets, took a walk about the campgrounds. The Grandpa-Granddaughter pair visited an elaborate children\u2019s playground which included, swings, see-saw, merry-go-round, a slide, tether ball and a hobby horses mounted on heavy duty springs.\nUntil nightfall, when another motor home pulled in, we\u2019 were the only ones in the campground.\nAfter supper everyonel remained seated about the kitchenette table watching television and chatting, before retiring at 8:30 PM.\nA leisurely morning\nI awoke at 4:10 AM Tuesday, September 22, but remained in bed until 5:20 AM before quietly getting up.\nWhile my traveling companions slept, I dressed and stepped outside into the predawn chill and walked to the KOA park\u2019s modern bathroom to wash and shave. Returning to the RV a short while later and finding everyone still asleep, I put on a heavy jacket and took a walk about the campgrounds. It was pleasant to be alone, to look up at the twinkling stars and walk in that strange place. The chilly temperatures felt invigorating; I pressed my hands deeper into my jacket pockets to keep them warm.\nAround 6:20 AM the rest of our group crawled out of their sleeping bags and came out, one and hurried off to the bathroom. After that, it wasn\u2019t long before we were all sitting around the table\u00a0enjoying our morning cups of coffee and a milk and cereal breakfast.\nMost of the morning was spent seeing the Pipestone National Monument museum and hiking the park\u2019s long, winding nature trail. During the previous centuries, Indians came from as far as 1000 miles, to mine\u00a0the pipestone mineral from the rock quarry for their ceremonial pipes. Over time, the crude mining operations resulted in several dozen small mines each six to ten feet deep and ten to fifteen feet wide. At the bottom of each of these miniature \u2018open pit mines\u2019, there was about a two foot wide irregular working space. Rock refuse piles built up around each pit created an unstable and hazardous talus pile.\nI felt\u00a0 a chunk of pipestone an thought it was fairly soft, having a hardness perhaps only about two or three times that of chalk and a feel described as slick or wet. The mineral ranged in color from rose pink to brick red.\nThoughts while returning home\nWe followed Highway #23 diagonally northeast, up across the state, from the southwestern corner of Minnesota, all the way to Foley. This was a quiet time. Donna was beginning to complain of a sore throat and felt like she was becoming ill. Don, Jane and I were all tired. During the previous four and a half days we drove nearly 1048 miles and stopped numerous times to visit my family\u2019s ancestral prairie homesteads, the towns they lived in, we talked history with people, browsed through graveyards, saw the local sights, hiked, and visit museums.\nI found that in our time in this world, we do leave traces that persist into deep time. The recognition of these traces are only realized when the proper key is inserted, when the proper questions are asked. When eyes that care look, old sights will be seen, lives sensed\nWhen we reached Spicer, Minnesota, everyone was feeling the need for an energy lift, so we stopped at a Dairy Queen for an ice cream. Upon biting into our cones, Don, Donna and I all commented at once that the ice cream didn\u2019t taste the way it use to. It was our guess that Dairy Queen had altered its ice cream formula, and not for the better. Thinking about declining \u2018quality standards\u2019 reminded me of a joke:\n\u201cA man walks up to the ticket counter at the Airport and inquires about prices. The ticket agent answers, \u2018Yes, we have cheap rates and fast, efficient service. Which would you like?\u201d\nDuring the previous four days, while on the prairie in Iowa, we had seen very little wooded terrain, but as we approached St. Cloud, in central Minnesota, the area of forest coverage\u00a0 increased rapidly. Also, Iowa\u2019s agricultural fields\u00a0 seemed to range in size between eighty and one hundred sixty acres, the largest field planted to one crop around St. Cloud is about forty acres.\nThinking about this, I realized that Iowa was settled by European culture a half century earlier than Minnesota. Iowa experienced a major influx of population between about 1840 and 1865. Minnesota followed with peaks in population growth occurring in the 1880s and 1890s. This is evident in the neighborhood of our rural home. The oldest farmhouses in Benton County date from the late 1880s to the early 1900s, these are \u2018first generation\u2019 houses. The oldest houses we saw in Iowa were second and third generation buildings.\nDon, alone and not feeling well\nWe had a great time traveling with Don, but he\u2019d changed since Eulah\u2019s death. Don\u00a0 seemed to have become more contrary and reclusive, noticeably so since his visit with us nine months earlier for Christmas.\u00a0 Since his arrival, Don would get up after Donna went to work, come in from the RV for a shower, then spend the rest of the morning back in his RV having breakfast and watching TV. Of course, Jane kept him company. Grandfather and Granddaughter were frequently seen walking slowly along the driveway and about the yard.\nEvery day, Don spent maybe an hour or two working on this or that mechanical part of his old motor home. Some of the work probably needed doing, but I think he was also just trying to keep busy working on mechanical things, something he loved to do.\u00a0 Don was not a happy man living alone. On top of his loneliness he was developing health problems: he\u2019d begun complaining of an upper stomach pain or burning sensation, which he attributed to a haitial hernia or an ulcer.\nBright and early on the morning of September 28, after a nice eighteen day visit, we said our \u2018Good Byes\u2019\u00a0to Don, and he left, enroute back to his home in Anderson, California.\nAfter our company left and life returned to normal around the house, I began writing up my notes from our trip to Iowa. It took seven hours per day for fifteen consecutive non weekend days, or one hundred plus hours work, to enter the story and associated colored pencil drawings into my journal.\n[Above, photocopy\u00a0of 1987\u00a0drawing from the front page of\u00a0Journal 14: Trace of the Temporal Visitor]\nThis\u00a0post\u00a0is continued in Chapter 1987, age 44-45, Part 3 of 3.\n[1] See \u2018signatures lists\u2019 below.\n[2] Located in Spring Valley, OH\n[3] See Journal 13-2, Volume 2, Daily Diary, page 2403, \u2018 25 July Saturday\u2019\n[4] Richard Matheson, Bid Time Return,\u00a0 (New York: The Viking Press, 1975)\n[5] We traded information for about ten or eleven years, up until about 1990 or 1991.\n[6] See Journal 2, The Realm, page 221, \u2018You and Your Family\u2019, also the entirety of Journal 6, The Travelers Guide.\n[7] See Journal 14, Trace of the Temporal Visitor, page 2609, \u2018Iowa Revisited\u2019\n[8] When her husband, Francis died, Lydia finished raising her children on the farm.

Glazed <em>ceramic</em> <em>pots</em> work well from a watering standpoint and are attractive.", "explanation": null, "document": "Profit From Writing\nBasic Guide to Indoor Container Gardening\nA real estate salesman will tell you that in buying and selling property \"location, location, location\"\u009d is everything. The same thing is true for indoor container gardening. Your success or failure will depend entirely on how well your containers are built, where they are placed, and how much light they receive -- especially if you plan to attempt herbs or vegetables. (Remember, the deeper rooted the vegetable the deeper pot it will need. If you're unsure, ask at your local nursery.) Of course the good thing is that because you are gardening in containers, you can move them. Be prepared for that if things start wilting.\nAlthough your indoor garden plants may require more of you in terms of planning and care, the reward of welcoming living plants into your home will far outweigh the challenges. A special word of caution, however. Many plants are toxic to household pets, cats in particular. If you have animals, you may want to place your containers in an area where the pets are not allowed or plan to carefully select only those plants that will not harm your furry friends.\nSelecting the Right Containers\nWe're all comfortable with the concept of having a fern in the house, the stray begonia, or maybe a cactus in the window sill. Ditch that idea if you really want to have an indoor garden.\u009d Start thinking in terms of attractive containers (remember, they're going to be part of your home) that are large enough (15 to 120 quarts) to play host to a community of complimentary plants. By selecting the right plants, you can even achieve natural pest control. Some plants have chemicals in their leaves or roots, which drive bugs away. For instance, planting basil near fennel will keep hover flies off the fennel. (Like the caution about your pets, this kind of planned planting requires careful research. Again, make a friend at your local plant nursery.)\nYou can use just about anything that will hold soil and provide adequate drainage as a container. (Drain holes should be about 1/2 inch across and don't forget to line the pot with a thin mesh at the bottom to prevent soil loss through the holes. Also, plan to set the pots up on something like bricks or decorative stands to further enhance drainage.) If necessary, you can always put holes in the bottom of whatever you've selected yourself. If you pick something like an interesting old washtub that will rust, get something of the approximate size and shape to serve as a liner and limit or eliminate the container's contact with moisture. Some other things to remember:\nContainers with narrow openings limit what you can plant.\nPlastic pots deteriorate when exposed to sunlight.\nWooden containers that are not lined rot. (Redwood and cedar do better than other woods.)\nTerracotta pots dray out rapidly, so the plants require watering more often.\nIn hot climates, pick light-colored pots to decrease the absorption of heat.\nGlazed ceramic pots work well from a watering standpoint and are attractive.\nSelecting Your Soil\nYou want a planting medium that holds enough moisture to keep the roots of your plants from drying out, but one that also drains fairly rapidly. (Standing water in a container makes the plants themselves rot.) Every plant has individual soil requirements, although most will do well in a high-grade potting mixture. (Just as a word of caution, most commercial mixes run a little on the acidic side and may require the addition of lime.) Most container gardeners choose a lightweight, 'soil-less'\u009d potting mixture to lessen the chances of plant disease and to discourage weed growth. When you fill the pots, you'll want to leave about two inches at the top so you'll have room to add mulch or something like sphagnum moss later on that assists with water retention.\nLocation, Location, Location\nAs a general rule, your plants will need a minimum of five hours of direct sun daily. If you're going to be planting something like tomatoes, you'll need more; cabbage or lettuce can do with less. You'll want to check the individual requirements for flowers as they vary widely. Do not put plants with widely divergent light requirements in the same pot. It's a recipe for disaster! Ditto with watering requirements. Container gardening is very much the science of pairing like plants with like plants to get the best results.\nWhen you work out the variables of container, potting soil, light, and moisture, you are well on the road to establishing a workable container garden. Start simple and work up toward more complex combinations. In the beginning you may find that some of the following annuals are your best choices: alyssum, begonia, coleus, geranium, impatiens, marigolds, periwinkle, nasturtiums, pansies, salvia, snapdragons, and zinnias. Over time, as you become more experienced with your containers, you can branch out and successfully grow an even wider variety of plants, adding natural life and color to your home environment.\n"}], [{"score": 381.9458, "uuid": "115af011-a6f2-50c7-b506-3676f4daa825", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1910wb-55-30814", "target_hostname": "www.lafayetteflorist.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lafayetteflorist.com/Brian-s-Blog/Page-1.html", "page_rank": 1.1745088e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Lafayette Florist, Gift Shop and Garden Center | Daily deliveries to", "snippet": "Get <em>in</em> touch with your inner farmer...

Moramarco\nSpathiphyllum \u2018Domino\u2019 has great variegated leaves that add loads of interest to any room.\nPhoto Credit: Donna W. Moramarco\nChances are you\u2019ve probably seen spaths growing in all kinds of interior spaces, from malls and atriums to offices, and of course, homes. Commonly known as peace lily, these beauties are wonderful choices for medium- and low-light areas.\nThere are all kinds of spath varieties to choose from, but they\u2019ve basically all got fairly long, oblong leaves that come to a point, and they all feature simple white blooms. A visit to your favorite local garden center should give you lots of choices. Ask a staff member to help you select the best one that fits your indoor space and needs.\nI suggest that if you\u2019re looking for something big, you check out Sensation Junior peace lily ( Spathiphyllum 'Stwentynine' (Sensation Junior) ), one of the largest spaths available. It\u2019s adored for its dark-green, ribbed foliage and large, long-lasting, white flowers. You can expect Sensation specimens to reach 6 feet, so make sure you give it some space. At the other end of the spectrum is \u2018Petite\u2019 peace lily ( Spathiphyllum \u2018Petite\u2019 ). This wee beauty provides the perfect scale of small, dark-green leaves and perky, white flowers for a small accent table or vanity. And there are many varieties in between, so one is sure to meet your indoor needs!\nAs I mentioned, spaths are easy to care for. And I\u2019m not kidding: Just place them in the right spot, and about all they\u2019ll need on a regular year-round basis is water. The best way to tell when your peace lily needs a drink is to stick your finger down a few inches into the medium. If it feels slightly dry, then water. If it\u2019s moist, wait.\nWhen you do water , add enough so the liquid drains out the bottom of the pot. If you\u2019ve got a tabletop spath, just bring the plant over to the sink for a thorough watering. (But use a watering can for heavy floor plants that are hard to move!) And remember, never let your plants sit in water. A few minutes after watering, drain any saucers of excess liquid.\nDuring the growing season (starting in spring), peace lilies can use fertilizer regularly. (Be sure to follow the package directions for the proper rate of application and frequency.) Then come November through February, give your spaths a rest from this ritual.\nLike most houseplants, spaths are dust magnets, so the foliage can use a little cleaning from time to time. (Plants depend on their leaves to manufacture food, so keeping them free of dust allows the process to happen more efficiently!) If possible, put the plants in the shower and rinse them off with lukewarm water.\nIf your peace lily looks like it\u2019s getting too big for its pot, don\u2019t be too hasty to move it into a larger container. These beauties don\u2019t mind being a little pot-bound. If you do decide to move your plant into a larger pot, it\u2019s best to do so in late winter or early spring. You can also do it in fall, just before you bring them back indoors for the winter. When you do repot , select a container that\u2019s no more than 2 inches larger in diameter than the old one, and use a multipurpose, well-drained potting soil. (And here\u2019s a helpful reminder: If you\u2019re reusing an old pot, make sure to sanitize it first!)\nAs beautiful and easy to care for as these plants are, they do occasionally run into problems with pests or diseases. Scale is a big pest culprit. One tell-tale sign of this pest problem is stickiness on the leaves or the floor area just below the plant. Before you treat the plant for scale , however, take a trip to your local garden center for help in selecting a proper and legal treatment for your plant.\nSpaths can also have leaf spots, which generally are fungal or bacterial in origin. For an accurate diagnosis, take a plant sample to an expert at either your local garden center or Extension office .\nTo avoid these problems altogether, try following a few cultural hints: Keep the foliage dry (which means no misting the leaves); try for consistent, good air circulation around the plant (think about placing it near open windows during the warmer months or near overhead fans); and only handle your spath when it\u2019s dry. Finally, don\u2019t forget to wash your hands before you touch other plants to avoid spreading any disease or insect.\nRoot rot can be a problem, too. To prevent this issue, make sure you don\u2019t overwater the plant. Also, only plant your peace lilies in pots with drainage holes. (And, again, do make sure to empty saucers of excess liquid.)\nThat said, place your peace lilies just about anywhere you\u2019d like in your home \u2013 they\u2019re a decorator\u2019s dream! (Take it from me: I\u2019ve got spaths in my living room, bathrooms and bedrooms.) Small-leaved varieties make excellent choices for coffee tables, end tables or nightstands. Large-leaved selections make wonderful choices as floor specimens. A single plant, when placed by a sofa or chair in a lovely decorative container can add all kinds of interest to any space. (Make sure if your pot is on any kind of porous surface, like wood, that you\u2019ve got a liner or saucer under it to catch any drippings.)\nSpectacular spaths are a wonderful, easygoing addition to any d\u00e9cor \u2013 whether you\u2019re a seasoned houseplant gardener or new to the whole houseplant thing. With just a little care and attention, they\u2019ll reward you with beautiful year-round flowers and foliage just about anywhere you place them. (What could be simpler than that?!)\nTweet\nFacts\nSpaths are clean-air plants. They\u2019ve been scientifically proven to filter indoor pollutants, like the harmful chemicals benzene (found in some oils and paints) and trichloroethylene (found in some foam insulation), from the air.\nTips\nUnless you live in tropical parts of the world (Zone 10 or warmer), spaths are indoor plants only \u2013 but you can give them a summer vacation. I live in New York, and every year from mid-May to September, my peace lilies are on my deck with an eastern exposure to give them some morning sunlight and shade the rest of the day. (Full sun is a no-no!)\n\u201cDress up\u201d your houseplants. I keep mine in the nursery pots I buy them in, then slip the entire plant in and out of decorative containers that match the current season or holiday.

(The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989, Clarendon Press, Oxford) ix Introduction Jayne Wilkins and Kirsten Anderson From the initial discovery of a site to its final interpretation, archaeologists use a variety of tools to perform each step of their research and analysis. An initial site survey in its most simple form involves pacing through a defined area and noting or collecting surface materials. However, technological advancements throughout the years have expanded the variety of survey tools available, most of which are time-efficient and minimally invasive. For example, remote sensing is a tool that provides archaeologists with the ability to quickly and accurately identify potential site locations using both aerial and ground imaging, often without stepping on the ground. Once a site has been located, an entirely different suite of tools is required for the recording and collection of archaeological data. Site set up and excavation requires consideration of the type of information to be recorded, the goals of the project, and the research design. Therefore, it is important that the tools selected are both appropriate and effective, whether they are the most advanced or the original tried and true. From its initial establishment, the discipline of archaeology has seen consistent improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of methods of excavation and data-recording. Most recently, archaeologists have started to incorporate instruments such as total stations, global positioning systems, and digital photography (Hester et al. 1997); however, most continue to use traditional methods of paper, pencil, and line level. By combining these approaches, the quality of the information recovered improves and ultimately expands the kinds of research questions that can be investigated. xi The analysis and interpretation of archaeological materials forms the final step in the research process. The most basic level of analysis involves identifying the attributes of individual artefacts. This may include, but is not limited to, colour, material, size, shape, and function. On their own, artefacts reveal evidence of their manufacture and use, and when studied together, a group of artefacts may provide information about culture, geographic location, or the associated environment. A complete collection of recovered artefacts can be analyzed at the site level, where it is possible to identify the function of various areas within a site, the spatial organization of activities and features, as well as the potential size and composition of the group that once lived there. Tools incorporated into a site-level interpretation often include spatial analysis, the identification of activity areas, and chronological reconstruction. Finally, archaeological investigations at the regional level change the focus from individual sites or artefacts to consider the spatial distribution of sites across a defined area, as well as the economic or cultural motivations for their arrangement. Regional analyses generally involve environmental reconstruction, settlement pattern analysis, and/or site location modelling. In recent years, the introduction of computer technology effectively increased the number of regional studies, as accurate interpretations at this level require the manipulation of large amounts of data. Regardless of the level of analysis selected \u2013 artefact, site, or region \u2013 archaeologists must apply tools based on their suitability for investigating a particular research question. When new tools are introduced, they are often initially well received but applied to research questions with a specific focus. As these tools continue to gain recognition, new ideas lead to the exploration of creative and innovative applications. It is during this stage that existing limitations emerge, resulting in a period of evaluation and necessary refinement. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis is an excellent example of an archaeological tool that is currently undergoing a period of assessment. The initial success of this tool was followed by grim methodological and theoretical criticisms and accusations of environmental determinism. In response, many archaeologists now work to incorporate aspects of social significance and human agency into their models of settlement patterns, land use, and site location modelling. As new research questions continue to test the boundaries of potential applications, the methods must change to meet the demand. The discipline of archaeology is evolving, and so are the tools we use to learn about the past. xii jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson The Conference The Chacmool conference is an annual event organized mainly by undergraduate students in the department of archaeology at the University of Calgary, Alberta. The theme of the conference in 2005 was \u201cTools of the Trade: Methods, Techniques, and Innovative Approaches in Archaeology\u201d and provided the inspiration for this volume. In late 2004, the conference committee solicited papers and symposia on topics related to two cognate themes (1) tools of the past, their manufacture, use, and cultural significance, and (2) the tools of the present, which are employed by archaeologists to understand the past. The conference organizers envisioned an event that would inspire the discussion of invention and the impact of technology on cultural development, including the origins of tool use, prehistoric technology, innovations in weaponry, agriculture, architecture, and transportation, and the role of trade, exchange, and diffusion in the spread of technological achievements. This element of the meetings was meant to serve as a self-reflexive exploration of technological development given that in recent years, archaeologists have been employing an increasing array of new tools to better interpret the archaeological record. This leads to the second component of the conference, which aimed to bring together scholars and students who wished to discuss the tools of the present, the innovative approaches to the analysis of archaeological materials and assemblages. The conference organizers were surprised by the overwhelming response of archaeologists who wished to discuss archaeological method. It was clear that scholars had responded favourably to the opportunity to discuss the innovative ways in which they had approached the study of past peoples and their archaeological signatures. Thus, sessions at the conference were organized to fulfill the needs of researchers who focused on various geographical locations and cultural timeframes but employed similar methodological approaches. There were a significant number of papers addressing new field methods, experimental approaches, cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoires, stable isotope analysis, microbotanical residue analysis, climate modelling, ancient DNA analysis, space syntax, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and remote sensing, and sessions were organized according to these topics. As planned, the resulting conference stimulated much conversation and debate regarding these and other archaeological methods and encouraged scholars to address the future role of these methods in the endeavour to understand the human condition via the archaeological record of the past. Introduction xiii With respect to tools of the past, the conference was well attended by palaeoanthropologists who study the origins and evolution of humanity. Discussions in the plenary session and the session entitled \u201cFrom Stone to Cell-phone: The Origins and Evolution of Technology\u201d addressed two main topics. First, researchers discussed the evidence for tool use among non-human primates and the implications for our traditional presumption that the use of tools defines humanity and distinguishes us from other animals. Second, researchers addressed the debate surrounding the origins of modern human behaviour and the archaeological signatures associated with it. As originally intended, the conference participants were exposed to a somewhat introspective and self-reflexive perspective on the origins of tool use, technological development, and the means by which we have become the only species to ask the questions: What is it to be us and how can we find out? The Contributions What follows is a sample of some of the most memorable presentations from the conference provided by a wide range of international archaeologists, senior professors, and students alike. The volume begins with a consideration of the earliest tools used by humans and presents examples of innovative tools used by archaeologists to interpret past human behaviour in regions and time periods as diverse as pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, Plio-Pleistocene Africa, and prehistoric North America. A broad range of interrelated topics and issues are touched upon in this volume: 1. Origins of tool use, culture, and modern human behaviour, primatological studies, cognitive psychology, and macro-evolutionary theory, Analyses at the level of the artefact, technological analyses, experimental archaeology, and cha\u00eenes op\u00e9ratoires, Qualitative vs. quantitative analyses, ceramic petrography, nonarchaeometric and archaeometric approaches to ceramic analysis, 2. 3. xiv jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson 4. 5. 6. Analyses at the level of the molecule, stable isotope analysis and ancient DNA, Archaeological visibility, the role of plants and archaeological \u2018non-sites\u2019, Analysis at the level of the site and beyond, computers, digital mapping, Geographic Information System, and space syntax. At first glance, the diversity of topics, regions, and time periods may seem vast, but the volume is meant to celebrate the variety inherent in archaeological analysis. It provides examples of innovative approaches that can be modified to address similar concerns in other regions and time periods. As the editors of this volume, we hope to encourage archaeologists to draw from outside fields in their interpretation of archaeological sites; to develop new methods in their consideration of old questions; to ask new questions about the areas in which they work; and to move beyond the established approaches and methods traditionally employed in their region and time period of study. With respect to the question of tool use origins, two contributors to this volume consider the Oldowan period of African prehistory (2.5 mya\u20131.4 mya). The Oldowan traditionally represents the earliest-known occurrence of human tool use, the advent of which is usually seen as a massive achievement in human cognitive ability and cultural aptitude. However, primatological studies reveal that tool use and culture, where culture is defined as \u201csocially transmitted innovation\u201d (Van Schaik 2004:139), were probably inherited from a common ancestor before the divergence of the hominid line (McGrew 1992). In this volume, Amber E. MacKenzie reviews the evidence provided by primatological studies of chimpanzee, orangutan, and gorilla populations and raises many interesting questions regarding the perceived importance of tool use in understanding human origins; if tool use doesn\u2019t make us unique, then what does? Susan Cachel examines the relationship between the appearance of tool-using behaviour, Oldowan assemblages, and human intelligence. Many traditional explanations for the origins of intelligence in vertebrate animals, especially humans, emphasize the role that social dynamics plays in the development of cognitive complexity (Whiten and Byrne 1997). Cachel, however, argues that attentiveness to the natural and physical environment (\u2018natural history intelligence\u2019) may be more Introduction xv pertinent for understanding the evolution of human intelligence. Interestingly, several aspects of Oldowan assemblages (2.5 mya\u20131.4 mya) exhibit characteristics suggestive of an intimate knowledge of the regional environment and the ability to track resource availability. Cachel suggests that some of these behaviours are consistent with those usually used to identify modern human behaviour in the archaeological record. Questions regarding the origins of modern human behaviour have received considerable attention over the past decade (Bar-Yosef 2002; Henshilwood and Marean 2003; Marean and Assefa 2005; McBrearty and Brooks 2000, Willoughby 2007). Modern human behaviour is usually recognized in the archaeological record via the presence of incontrovertible art, structural features and elaborate hearths, fishing technology, carved bone and ivory, complex burial practices and other features consistent with contemporary hunter-gatherer groups. These traits appear coeval in the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe but exhibit considerable temporal and spatial variability in the African Stone Age. Pamela R. Willoughby examines the debate surrounding this issue in light of macro-evolutionary theory, posing several questions about the development of human culture: How do we define behavioural modernity? Was the development of behavioural modernity a biological or a cultural process? Was the change gradual or a punctuated event? Continued investigations into these questions and others regarding the origins of tool use, culture, and behavioural modernity are warranted. As discussed above, archaeologists employ an increasing array of new tools to better interpret the archaeological record and address questions regarding human behaviour. Experimental archaeology is used to generate and test hypotheses and interpretations, based upon archaeological source material, like ancient structures and artefacts. It contributes to Binford\u2019s (1977) Middle Range Theory by providing linking arguments between the static archaeological record of the past and the dynamic record of present human behaviour, relationships, and organization. Various experimental approaches incorporate different aspects of artefact replication, performance testing, reverse engineering, and taphonomic effects. Three contributions to this volume use unique experimental approaches that contribute significantly to our understanding of past human behaviour and technology. First, Nick Waber employs experimental research to determine how variance in atlatl length affects throwing distance and accuracy. Performance testing demonstrates the benefits of atlatl use for dart propulsion and xvi jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson provides an adaptive explanation for atlatl length restraints. Eugene M. Gryba and Purple Kumai also employ an experimental approach in their consideration of Glass Buttes obsidian, heat treatment, and use wear, introducing an inventive means by which raw and heat-treated lithic material from the archaeological record might be distinguishable. Via replication, Jason Roe examines the morphological and technological characteristics of Embarras Bipoints from the Northern Plains, which has diagnostic qualities and can be used to further our understanding of culture-history in Alberta. He goes further to suggest that the study of the patterns and anomalies in both the archaeological and the replicative cha\u00eenes op\u00e9ratoires can help to illuminate the human process of making points. In addition to the use of experimental approaches, these three analyses share their level of analysis \u2013 the artefact. They attempt to identify the factors that conditioned human choice during artefact manufacture and address the questions: How did people construct these artefacts and why did they do it that way? They employ experimental archaeology \u2013 the tool of the present \u2013 to further understand the use and manufacture of various tools of the past, the atlatl, heattreated obsidian, and the Embarras Bipoint. Experimental studies that address the above questions regarding the production of material culture often contribute to cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire studies. Cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire, as part of a more general group of archaeological constructs generally described as \u201csequence models\u201d (Bleed 2001), is used to understand and describe the technological actions and operations of past systems and more often than not, stone tool production. There have been three related but somewhat independent approaches employed by archaeologists in various regions of the world. In Japan, gih\u014d, literally translated as \u201ctechnique,\u201d focuses on identifying the sequence of linked technological actions, or the routine of stone tool production. This routine is culturally determined, and as such, exhibits variation across geographic space. In France, cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire, or \u201cchain of operations\u201d describes the technological actions and human process involved in the raw material procurement, production, use, maintenance, and discard of material culture items, while emphasizing the underlying cognitive process or grammar (Bleed 2001; Inizan et al. 1999; Leroi-Gourhan 1943). In North America, the concept of sequence modelling usually involves the manipulation of morphological or typological categories from the archaeological record that relate to different production stages (i.e., blank, preform, finished product). The emphasis Introduction xvii is breaking down the presupposition that the final form of all lithic remains represents the intended products of the toolmaker. Stone tool reduction is a continuous and dynamic process, and consequently, a significant amount of variation in stone-tool size and form owes to reduction, use, and retouch. For example, Oldowan cobbles become discoids and then become scrapers (Sahnouni et al. 1997). But reduction is a continuous process, and as Michael J. Shott puts it, defining types among these tools can be \u201clike slicing a piece of water from a flowing stream\u201d (Shott, this volume). Here, Shott presents a means by which the degree of lithic reduction can be quantified on a continuous scale, and the effects of attrition and chance identified, using samples of Midwestern North American Palaeoindian bifaces and endscrapers. Reduction analysis explains variation at the level of the tool and the assemblage in terms of curation, or tool utility, rather than tool function. The quantification methods presented by Shott may one day become standard tools of the trade in sequence modelling or cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire studies of stone tool production. Another contributor considers the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of material culture, but in this case the objects of study are ceramic. Meaghan M. Peuramaki-Brown uses ceramic petrography to understand the pot production in pre-Columbian Honduras. The presence of potstands, which are produced from old ceramic products and maintain on them the remains of wet pots, provide a unique opportunity for the analysis of pot manufacture at the site of Rancho del Rio. Petrographic analysis reveals that some materials not available in the immediate area were included in the ceramics manufactured on site, bringing up interesting questions regarding inter- and intra-valley trade of temper products and schist in pre-Columbian Honduras. Studies such as Peuramaki-Brown\u2019s demonstrate how chaine op\u00e9ratoire studies can shed light on the socio-economic and cultural characteristics of past peoples. The analytical tools used by ceramicists and all other archaeologists are continually changing. Established methods are often replaced by new technology that promises to revolutionize our way of thinking; however, most would caution against the complete abandonment of traditional methodology. In an evaluation of pottery manufacturing traditions of the Peten Postclassic Maya, Leslie Cecil argues for the importance of both archaeometric and non-archaeometric methods. Each approach offers specific advantages for the analysis and understanding of ceramics. The introduction of innovative approaches such as archaeometric analyses expands the variety of data that can be acquired, as xviii jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson demonstrated by Peuramaki-Brown\u2019s petrographic study of Honduran ceramics discussed above. Indeed, the true utility of an analytical tool is demonstrated by the ability to improve current knowledge. As Cecil suggests, success occurs when several approaches are combined, creating well-rounded conclusions and a more complete understanding of the past. The introduction of advanced and highly specialized tools provides researchers with an opportunity to reach a new stage of analysis at the artefact level \u2013 the molecule. With these new tools, archaeologists have the potential to revisit past conclusions, often resulting in completely new and unexpected interpretations. The use of stable isotope analysis in archaeology has demonstrated continued utility, expanding beyond questions of diet and subsistence patterns. In an investigation of spire lopped Olivella biplicata beads, Tobin Bottman tests three models of trade routes associated with the northern Great Basin. Oxygen and carbon isotopes are analyzed to determine the probable coastal origin of shell beads found at sites within the interior. Surprisingly, the results support the model based on a trade network that was previously thought to involve only the southwestern portion of the Great Basin (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987). The results of this study demonstrate both the potential significance of stable isotope analysis for this type of research, as well as the importance of applying innovative research tools to test and potentially redefine our current understandings. The molecular analysis of ancient DNA has dramatically improved our understanding of the genetic relationships within prehistoric populations, migration patterns, animal and plant domestication, and the relationship between modern humans and our extinct ancestors (Stone 2000). As the methods of data collection and analysis continue to improve, research questions have begun to explore exciting and diversified topics. While the original focus of molecular ancient DNA analysis was the understanding of human populations, Maria Victoria Monsalve and her colleagues take ancient DNA analysis in an entirely different direction. In their paper, Monsalve et al. explore the utility of ancient DNA analysis for species and sub-species identification among the remains of butchered animals from a precontact kill site near the town site of Banff, Alberta, and Rocky Mountain House National Historic Site. Due to the fractured nature and poor preservation of faunal assemblages from kill sites, comparative methods of zooarchaeological analysis seldom identify fragments to species level. Molecular analysis successfully identified elk and moose, with elk being Introduction xix tentatively identified to the sub-species level. The benefits of this study move beyond traditional archaeological application, as the accurate identification of prehistoric animal populations may assist in understanding and managing modern ungulate populations. As the methods archaeologists use to explore the past continue to improve the way research questions are analyzed, they also allow us to consider components of the archaeological record that may have been previously overlooked. One of the most important examples concerns the role of plants in the archaeological record. Previous research has tended to overlook plant materials in favour of more highly visible and well-preserved materials such as stone, ceramics, and fauna. However, the recent expansion of methods has begun to identify plant remains in various archaeological contexts. In a discussion of subarctic Athapaskan and northern Northwest Coast cultures, Leslie Main Johnson reviews the archaeological evidence associated with plant use, including the role of different species. Johnson\u2019s paper confirms the importance of plants to the resource base, while showcasing the variety of unique and unconventional ways in which plant use can be identified archaeologically. Another example of visibility in the archaeological record focuses on the site or regional level of archaeological analysis. Sites are often identified as highly visible material concentrations, which can reveal substantial information about the use of a specific area throughout the period of occupation. However, difficulty arises when attempting to understand movement throughout a region using a small number of well-defined site locations. Alternatively, small artefact scatters, or non-sites (Brady, this volume) have the potential to reveal new information with respect to regional mobility and settlement patterns. Surface survey has been an invaluable tool for the identification of archaeological sites; however, it can also be utilized as a method for identifying small, less visible artefact scatters. Ryan T. Brady refines traditional surface survey to understand the distribution of stone artefacts associated with wetland habitats across the Great Basin. Previous research has suggested two models associated with the use of wetland habitat, both of which Brady argues are overly simplistic. The results of the non-site survey indicate variation in the intensity of use among freshwater, brackish, and saline wetlands, as well as differences associated with the types of activities performed at specific areas and elevations. It also highlights the importance of innovation in the attempt to increase and improve our understanding of regional settlements and subsistence patterns. xx jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson Settlement pattern analysis, along with many aspects of archaeological research, has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of computer technology. Computers have brought about one of the greatest revolutions in archaeology with respect to storing, sharing, and analyzing data. Not only have computers increased the quantity and quality of information that can be processed, they have also had a profound influence on the types of questions archaeologists are able to ask and answer. In recent years, one of the areas of archaeology that has seen the greatest impact has been spatial analysis. Three main areas of research: (1) regional and intra-site spatial analysis, (2) site location modelling for cultural resource management, and (3) landscape archaeology have come to rely on computer technology to address questions associated with our understanding of the cultural landscape. Perhaps one of the greatest innovations driving the refinement and expansion of spatial analysis has been the introduction of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which have completely changed the role of spatial data and cartographic display (Knoerl 1991). Specifically, GIS analysis is a powerful research tool for the input, mathematical manipulation, analysis, capture, retrieval, and display of spatially referenced real-world data (Fisher 1999; Kvamme 1989). GIS analysis has demonstrated continued success and expanding utility for archaeological applications, but its rapid integration has often been criticized for resulting in an absence of critical evaluation. The sophisticated nature of the technology has the potential to dictate research and the questions asked of the data (Allen et al. 1990). Therefore, it is important to focus research questions on the archaeological record and avoid compromising data in favour of the method. Archaeologists must also consider the costs associated with equipment and technical training, the quality of data analysis, and the availability of existing digital data. While graphical representations provide an excellent medium for display, the results can lead to the creation of impressive, detailed images without true analytical value. Go Matsumoto discusses some of the difficulties associated with GIS and digital mapping at the archaeological site of Pachacamac on the Peruvian central coast. In his paper, Matsumoto highlights the problems encountered during the collection and manipulation of data, while offering a number of suggestions for the future improvement of data quality and access among archaeologists. Introduction xxi One of the most recent advances in spatial analysis has been the growing awareness of the cultural importance of landscape. Two computer applications, cost surface analysis (GIS) and space syntax (Hillier and Hanson 1984) have been used to address cultural perceptions of space at the site and regional levels of analysis. Previous studies of landscape tended to focus on the distribution of resources or sites from an environmental and ecological perspective without consideration of the underlying social motivations of human settlement and movement. For example, cost surface analysis creates a computerized model of the landscape and evaluates the costs of movement associated with any number of specified variables. Until recently, cost surface was restricted to the evaluation of movement associated with physical costs (vegetation, elevation, slope, etc.). However, social costs such as religion or social structure play an equally important role in the movement of people across the landscape. In an evaluation of trade and exchange systems in ancient Egypt, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Pellini incorporates both physical and cultural factors into a cost surface analysis of ceramic circulation maps. His study demonstrates the important role of social factors in his region of study and beyond. Following the theories of Bourdieu (1977) and Giddens (1984), which discuss the role of social organization in everyday life, space syntax analysis operates under the assumption that all space is socially constructed. Space syntax examines the construction of buildings with respect to the types of spatial boundaries they create. Within buildings, this may include the degree of accessibility associated with particular rooms as dictated by the arrangement of doors and hallways, while the space outside buildings is determined by the arrangement of physical structures, resulting in differential accessibility and defined areas of private and public space. Following the principles of space syntax, Joshua Wells examines changes in the organization of space throughout the Dohack and Range phases of the Terminal Late Woodland. Changes in the arrangement of built and open space reveal evidence for changes in social organization. Specifically, Wells identifies distinct differences in the arrangement of private and communal space during each phase, with the later Range phase developing patterns similar to those of the succeeding Mississippian period. As Wells suggests, this type of research may have greater potential for understanding the development and spatial distribution of Mississippian culture and influence. As outlined by the principles of space syntax, the interior organization of buildings has the potential to reveal important information regarding social xxii jayne wilkins and kirsten anderson interaction. A variation of space syntax, spatial string-matching, uses the arrangement and function of different rooms from known cases (e.g., a wellpreserved building) as a comparative method for identifying similarities in unknown cases. This process has the potential to reveal information about the intended function or use of poorly preserved buildings. As a result, buildings that were previously ignored or excluded can contribute to the interpretation of social organization. Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton use the process of spatial string-matching to examine vernacular houses from rural Cyprus. In cases where the function and/or layout of a particular room is unknown, Kirsan and Conroy Dalton employ spatial-string matching to make predictions based on the level of similarity to known cases. The papers included in this volume are a sample of the variety of analytical tools currently being applied in archaeological analysis. Each demonstrates how innovative tools used today answer challenges of the past and raise new questions for the future. Archaeology as a discipline has undergone many transformations and will no doubt continue to advance. Therefore, it is with great anticipation that we wait to revisit this topic in the years to come.

Byrne (editors) 1997 Willoughby, P. R. 2007 Introduction xxv 1 Great Ape Tool Use and the Oldowan Amber E. MacKenzie Abstract. The manufacture and utilization of tools have long been attributed to the hominin line and were often used as a means to differentiate between ourselves and the other primates. However, in recent decades, the discovery that other great apes engage in such innovation disrupted previous notions of what makes our phylogenetic line so unique. Not only do chimpanzees and orangutans make use to utilize stone on stone methods for food extraction. This recent observation, of floral material for various functions, chimpanzees have additionally been found whether derived or ancestrally predisposed, has provided an ethnological link to 2.5 Mya. This paper is a comparison of the form and function of the Oldowan and the Oldowan, the earliest known archaeological culture appearing approximately the \u2018tools\u2019 that are currently being manufactured by modern non-human great apes. The insights drawn from these comparisons may provide a means to further may help to clarify the characteristics that define us as distinct from the other primates. understand the motivations that plagued our ancestors 2.5 Mya and, furthermore, \u0018 Introduction The advent of the Oldowan tool industry (2.5 mya\u20131.5 mya) has often been cited as an advancement in the mental complexity of the hominin line (Van Schaik 2004:183), that consequently cascaded our Pleistocene ancestors further into modernity. However, evidence emerging from more recent work in primatology is countering this claim. The evidence suggests that contemporary non-human great apes exhibit a mental capacity equivalent to Oldowan hominins in terms of tool1 use and manufacture (Wynn and McGrew 1989:388), and thus that the Oldowan archaeological industry was merely an extension of a pre-existing primate mental template (Van Schaik 2004:154). These studies, which have emerged in recent decades, have focused on the capabilities of the non-human great apes to manufacture and use tools in captivity and in the wild, focusing in particular on the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) (Alp 1997; Celli et al. 2004; McGrew 1992; Mercader et al. 2002; Povinelli 2000; Van Lawick-Goodall 1967; Whiten and Boesch 2001; Wynn and McGrew 1989), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) (Van Schaik 2004), bonobo (Pan paniscus) (Hohmann and Fruth 2003), and more recently the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) (Breuer et al. 2005). Although some researchers feel it is inappropriate to use modern non-human great apes to infer Oldowan hominin behaviour and mentality (Povinelli 2000:1\u20132; Marks 2002:179), there are many who regard this form of ethnology as a useful mechanism with the potential to reveal more about the human evolutionary path than ethnological research based solely on contemporary humans (Van Lawick-Goodall 1967:91; Wynn and McGrew 1989:384; Whiten and Boesch 2001:60). According to Kimura (1999:807), the current model of Oldowan technology consists of a \u2018least-effort strategy,\u2019 controlled primarily by raw material access and abundance. Evidence for this model can be seen in certain Oldowan archaeological sites, including sites in Omo, Ethiopia, and Koobi Fora, Kenya, where the artefact assemblages consist primarily of local and hence easily attainable raw materials, such as quartz and lava, respectively (Kimura 1999:808). One would surmise that if the Oldowan hominins were indeed slaves to their environment, then the contemporary non-human great apes who potentially rival their Oldowan cousins technologically (at least in terms of mental capacity) (Wynn and McGrew 1989:388) would similarly be indebted to their environment for their technological prowess. On the contrary, this does not \u0018 Amber E. MacKenzie seem to be the case. Evidence is mounting that culture2 may prove as equally influential as environment in terms of primate tool use and manufacture, based on modern reports of chimpanzee (McGrew 1992; Alp 1997; Whiten and Boesch 2001), orangutan (Van Schaik 2004), and bonobo (Hohmann and Fruth 2003) cultural activity within a technological context. Our knowledge of the gorilla tool-kit (Breuer et al. 2005) is quickly rivalling the chimpanzee, although the influence of culture on the technology of wild gorillas has yet to be demonstrated conclusively. The cultural idiosyncrasies observable in modern great apes combined with the lack of evidence for a \u2018tool culture\u20193 in the Oldowan archaeological industry suggest a paradox that must be examined in the light of recent primatological evidence. Thus, this paper examines the \u2018tool cultures\u2019 of various communities of chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, in an attempt to determine the level of cultural influence on the tool-kit of the Oldowan hominins in the absence of archaeological evidence. Evidence for Chimpanzee Tool Culture According to Whiten and Boesch (2001:60), each community of chimpanzees exhibits its own culture to such a degree that one can distinguish where an individual chimpanzee comes from based solely on his or her behavioural tendencies. It seems as though every community of chimpanzees has developed its own unique method to accomplish the same functional objective (Whiten and Boesch 2001:60). An excellent example of chimpanzee cultural variation is given by McGrew (1992:180). Populations of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania, and another in Kasoje, Tanzania, share a common genotype, and a nearly identical habitat. Each group makes use of an extensive tool-kit that overlaps to a degree but also exhibits a significant amount of variation. There is enough variation between these two populations to warrant evidence for cultural influence on chimpanzee technology (McGrew 1992:180). According to McGrew (1992:180), the Gombe community of chimpanzees engages in the use of eleven different habitual patterns of tool use, while the Kasoje community engages in only eight separate habitual patterns. Five of the tool use patterns habitual to the Gombe chimpanzees are absent in the Kasoje community, including the antdip, honey-dip, leaf-sponge, leaf-napkin, and the self-tickle patterns (McGrew 1: Great Ape Tool Use and the Oldowan \u0018 1992:180). Furthermore, two new patterns of habitual tool use have emerged in the Kasoje community that are absent in the Gombe group, including the ant-fish, and the leaf-clip patterns (McGrew 1992:180). Hence, there exist two different groups of genetically related chimpanzees, inhabiting nearly identical niches, that developed two unique methods for subsistence and comfort (selftickle and leaf-napkin) despite environmental similarity. Another example of technological variation shaped by culture among the chimpanzees can be seen in Alp\u2019s (1997:45) observations of technological innovation among the Tenkere chimpanzees of Sierra Leone. This particular community has developed two novel habitual tool forms. Alp (1997:45) refers to one of the novel tool forms as \u201cstepping-sticks,\u201d which involves the use of loose sticks as foot protection against the thorny kapok trees while climbing and standing during foraging behaviour. The other, which Alp (1997:45) refers to as \u201cseat-sticks,\u201d involves the use of sticks to protect the body from the thorns of the kapok tree while seated and subsisting. According to Alp (1997:45\u201346), chimpanzees subsist on the kapok tree in many locations, including Bossou, Guinea, and Mont Assirik, Senegal; however, there are no records of this form of technology in any of these localities. Thus, culture must be the agent responsible for the emergence of these novel variations in the tool-kit of these West African chimpanzees. Evidence for Bonobo Tool Culture Not surprisingly, the bonobo shares a similar tool-kit with the chimpanzee, while continuing to maintain their own species variations (Hohmann and Fruth 2003:564). Like the chimpanzee, bonobos exhibit a significant cultural influence over their tool-kits. According to Hohmann and Fruth (2003:568\u2013569), the Wamba community of bonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo make use of a leaf rain hat to protect themselves from the rain during the rainy season, while the Lomako bonobos of the same nationality do not. Both regions share a similar annual rainfall, temperature, and available vegetation. Alternatively, Lomako bonobos cover their bodies with twigs and leaves at night to guard against the incessant rain (Hohmann and Fruth 2003:568). Thus, the Wamba and the Lomako populations of bonobos developed two very different tool strategies to achieve the same means in similar ecological conditions. Like \u0018 Amber E. MacKenzie the chimpanzee, this condition infers the influential presence of culture on the bonobo tool-kit. Evidence for Or angutan Tool Culture Unfortunately the orangutan has often been overlooked in the study of human evolution, possibly as a result of the seemingly low frequency of tool production by wild orangutans (Van Schaik 2004:137). It is only recently that technologically proficient orangutans have been discovered in the wild (Van Schaik 2004:137). Additionally, orangutans are now known to contribute to the great ape tool culture debate alongside the chimpanzee and bonobo. According to Van Schaik (2004:138), nearly all of the orangutans that belong to the Suaq community on Sumatra utilize two forms of tools to extract insects and honey from trees and the seeds from the thorny cemengang fruit. However, not one orangutan from the Ketambe population of Sumatra engages in such tool use. Furthermore, Van Schaik (2004:145) discusses the Singkil, Sumatra, community of orangutans who use a peeled-stick tool to extract the seeds from the thorny cemengang fruit. This same kind of tool use is observed in orangutan populations on distant Borneo. However, directly across the river from the peeled-stick tool using Singkil population is the Batu-Batu community of orangutans that do not make use of tools to extract the seeds from the cemengang fruit. Instead the Batu-Batu orangutans rely on brute force to smash the fruit and extract the calorie-rich seeds. Van Schaik (2004:145) contends that only a cultural explanation could cede a logical conclusion in a situation where two communities of orangutans, one knowledgeable in the use of tools, and the other reliant on brute force tactics, could inhabit an identical environmental niche merely a few kilometres away from one another. The river in this case serves as a geological barrier between the two communities, blocking the diffusion of group innovation. In addition, the independent emergence of peeled-stick tool use in Borneo is highly suggestive of the innovative capabilities of the wild orangutan. Significant evidence exists for the presence and affect of culture on the technology of most of the great apes. Evidence for the technological and cultural capacity of the gorilla is expected to increase in the near future as research increases in this area. The Gombe and Kasoje chimpanzees, along with the 1: Great Ape Tool Use and the Oldowan \u0018 Wamba and Lomako bonobos, and the Singkil and Batu-Batu orangutans, exhibit cultural variation where one would expect to see congruency if environment was the only influential factor. Thus, a sense of cultural significance is established with respect to the technological capabilities of the non-human great apes. The lack of evidence for this form of cultural influence on the Oldowan archaeological industry of our hominin forbearers is unexpected, given modern great ape potential and known capabilities, and therefore deserves further discussion. The Oldowan Par adox The earliest reliable estimates for the appearance of the Oldowan Industrial Complex are known from the Gona region of Ethiopia, dating as far back as 2.5\u20132.6 mya (Semaw 2000:1197). However, numerous Oldowan localities have been discovered in both eastern and southern Africa, spanning a chronological range of approximately one million years. Among the most notable of these localities are Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, Koobi Fora, Kenya, and the Omo River Valley of Ethiopia. The production of Oldowan technology, consisting primarily of cores, flakes, hammerstones, and manuports, is most commonly attributed to Homo habilis. However, additional fossil humans contemporaneous with H. habilis, such as Paranthropus robustus and Paranthropus boisei, have also been found in association with Oldowan stone tools (Klein 1999:235\u2013236). Regardless of which early human ancestor was responsible for the emergence and subsequent production of Oldowan technology, there remains a lack of archaeological evidence to support the presence of a tool culture equivalent to that observed among contemporary great apes. According to Kimura (1999:808), the influence of raw material selection, and therefore environment, on the Oldowan cannot be exaggerated based on available archaeological evidence. For example, localities such as Omo, Senga (Kimura 1999:808), and the lower levels of Koobi Fora (Toth 1987:770) exhibit a 97 per cent frequency of localized raw materials in their artefact assemblages. De la Torre\u2019s (2004:439\u2013465) re-examination of the Omo material (consisting primarily of angular fragments and flakes) further substantiates Kimura\u2019s (1999:808) earlier claims of the fundamental influence of the environment on Oldowan stone tool production. According to de la Torre (2004:453), the selec\u0018 Amber E. MacKenzie tion of raw material and knapping patterns observed at Omo 123 and Omo 57 suggest a sophisticated knowledge of tool production in response to environmental conditions. Furthermore, de la Torre (2004:454) describes the apparent \u2018technocultural homogeneity\u2019 of early Oldowan archaeological deposits, an attribute which would seem to contradict the evidence provided by recent primatological observations of great ape behaviour. On the other hand, Kimura (1999:809) notes that Olduvai Gorge exhibits an alternative pattern of raw material procurement. Lava and quartz are the most frequently exploited materials at Olduvai, with chert following close behind (Kimura 1999:809). According to Kimura (1999:809), raw materials at Olduvai Gorge are not proportional to the artefact classes present in the assemblages. Kimura (1999:809) believes that these disproportionate representations suggest that certain raw materials were chosen for certain types of artefacts. Stout et al. (2005:373) observed a similarly disproportionate selection of raw materials at Gona, Ethiopia, suggesting that preferential selection of raw materials was present 2.5 mya, among the earliest makers of stone tools. Variable preference for raw materials may be related to cultural variation in tool production. However, the above evidence alone does not suggest a cultural model of Oldowan technology; in fact, it can just as equally suggest the opposite, that the raw material itself was selected for based on material characteristics relevant to the manufacture of stone tools (environmental factors), as was suggested by Stout et al. (2005:375). Isotope analysis on more than 30,000 pieces of chert found in level MNKFC (1.65\u20131.53 mya) of Olduvai Gorge, suggest that Oldowan hominins may have transported all of this chert from further south, even though chert was readily available within the gorge (Kimura 1999:811). Unfortunately, Kimura (1999:811) adds that isotope analysis on chert is often variable, and thus the large sample of chert may actually be from within the gorge. If on the other hand the isotope analysis is correct, the transportation of chert from outside of Olduvai Gorge may suggest a cultural influence on tool production during the Oldowan. In other words, it seems illogical for a community of hominins to import such a vast quantity of material into the gorge, when the same material was already easily available, unless there was some degree of cultural motivation involved. It is impossible at this time to determine regional cultural variation in the Oldowan using the same method employed on the previously examined great 1: Great Ape Tool Use and the Oldowan \u0018 apes because you cannot isolate an instance of time where two separate groups coexisted, due to the inaccuracy of the current dating methods. However, despite the lack of archaeological corroboration and support from researchers (e.g., de la Torre 2004:454), there remains strong phylogenetic evidence to support the existence of an Oldowan tool culture. Based on a consensus tree of over one hundred hypotheses of primate phylogenetic relationships, Purvis (1995) arranges the great apes into clades, such that the orangutan is the first to diverge from the last common ancestor of all the great apes, followed by the gorilla, and then the chimpanzees (common chimpanzee and bonobo), with whom we share the most recent common ancestor. As was demonstrated above, the orangutan, the chimpanzee, and the bonobo exhibit a culturally varied repertoire of technological forms. In this instance, it is most parsimonious to assume that the common ancestor of these great apes also possessed this behaviour, as opposed to each of the apes developing these behavioural tendencies in parallel. It is therefore rational to conclude that Oldowan hominins, such as H. habilis, also retained this ancestral cultural behaviour and had the potential to produce a regionally diversified tool-kit 2.5 mya, independent of environmental influence. The regional diversification of technology is commonly perceived as an archaeological landmark indicating behavioural modernity in early humans (McBrearty and Brooks 2000:492). However, the presence of this form of cultural behaviour among modern great apes suggests that its use as an indicator of modern human behaviour should be considered in the context of degree rather than kind. In addition, the phylogenetic evidence detailed above lends support to the model proposed by McBrearty and Brooks (2000:486) that envisions a gradual development in the complexity of human behaviour over a long period of time, in opposition to the more punctuated model of a human cultural \u2018revolution.\u2019 At the very least, there is strong evidence to suggest that the human cultural condition is merely an elaboration of an ancestral primate trait and not a uniquely derived human attribute as previously considered. Conclusion Chimpanzees, including those belonging to the Gombe and Kasoje populations (McGrew 1992:66\u201372) and the Tenkere community (Alp 1997:45), all readily \u0018 Amber E. MacKenzie demonstrate the presence and affect of culture on chimpanzee tool production. Likewise, the Wamba and Lomako bonobos (Hohmann and Fruth 2003:568\u2013 569) and the Singkil and Batu-Batu orangutans (Van Schaik 2004:145) also demonstrate the influence of culture on their respective tool-kits. The presence of this innovative behaviour in the majority of the great apes suggests most parsimoniously that this innovative condition was the ancestral behaviour of the great ape clade and thus that Oldowan hominins likely exhibited this same condition or at the very least had the potential to do so. Furthermore, although there is presently little evidence of cultural variation in gorilla tool use, the widely accepted phylogenetic position of the gorilla relative to the other great apes (e.g., Purvis 1995:411) suggests that the gorilla should be equally capable of manifesting this behaviour as well. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the Oldowan archaeological record, a proper comparison is unable to be made, and no conclusive evidence can be drawn as of yet to support the cultural model of tool production in the Oldowan. It may be that a single community of hominins founded the Oldowan archaeological industry, which could explain the incessant uniformity between Oldowan archaeological sites. Additionally, it is possible that evidence that could have supported this hypothesis decomposed long ago, as it is likely that our early hominin ancestors engaged in the use of perishable materials for tool production to supplement their well-documented stone tool technology. Another likely hypothesis is that the existence of tool culture could simply be determined by the presence versus the absence of a stone tool technology between hominin communities. However, it is not possible to conclusively prove the absence of stone tools from a given area due to taphonomic processes. Nevertheless, the cultural activity of contemporary non-human great apes pleads the case of cultural influence on early hominin technology, regardless of the lack of archaeological evidence. Future research should focus on the continued effort to fill in the gaps of the archaeological record, while continuing to develop a better understanding of known archaeological data. Additional research on great ape cultural behaviours, especially the gorilla, will prove fruitful, if only to reinforce the behavioural capabilities of our hominin ancestors. Finally, the conservation of the great apes is quickly becoming a pertinent issue. Populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans continue to decrease despite current efforts to save them. Our closest relatives stand to provide a significant amount of information 1: Great Ape Tool Use and the Oldowan \u0018 about our evolutionary heritage, and therefore their conservation is paramount to the study of hominin evolution.

The first hominid tools may have been hammerstones, used to batter \u0018\u0018 Complex Behaviours in Animals I will emphasize two themes in this paper. The first theme is that many animals other than great apes \u2013 especially other mammals and birds \u2013 can be useful in examining selection pressures involved in the origins of complex behaviours like tool use and manufacture or food storage. The second theme is that the social cognition and social dynamics of non-human primates may hinder the appearance of tool behaviour, if it orients attention completely to the competitive social world. Tools often form the interface between humans and their environment. It is natural, then, that the concept of a special relationship between tool behaviour and human uniqueness is very old. It can be traced back to Greco-Roman antiquity, and tools also act as a major catalyst in many scientific models of hominization. However, there is a 3.5-million-year gap between hominid origins at 6 mya and the appearance of an archaeological record, and the traditional link between tool behaviour and hominid origins is thus currently impossible to support. Animal tool behaviour has been intensively investigated in a comparative fashion by many researchers. Tools are often used to obtain food, especially when an animal lacks natural structures to acquire or process food (Alcock 1972). There seems to be no necessary relationship between tool behaviour and the origin of intelligence (Beck 1980). Anthropologists and primatologists have devoted much attention to cataloguing and analyzing great ape (particularly chimpanzee) tool behaviour, as well as foraging behaviour, and nest construction. The implication is that phylogeny or genetic relatedness is the major determinant of these behaviours and that their existence in great apes reveals something about their origin in hominids. However, similar selection pressures can yield similar behaviour in animals that are remote in ancestry. Beck (1982:4) discusses the bias against recognizing the complex cognitive abilities of other animals as a form of \u201cchimpocentrism.\u201d In fact, no wild non-human primate engages in complex cooperative foraging, food sharing, food caching, habitual tool use and modification, artefact creation, or landscape modification to the extent that hominids or other animals do. Corvid birds, for example, exhibit habitual tool use and manufacture and intricate tool modification under novel circumstances. One such corvid species is the New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides), which is famous for the \u0018\u0018 Susan Cachel manufacture and use of tools to probe for and extract otherwise inaccessible food items, such as wood-boring beetle larvae. This species also creates hook tools, a category of tool not observed in the archaeological record until the Upper Palaeolithic (Weir et al. 2002). Miniature video cameras have been mounted on the tails of wild New Caledonian crows, in order to investigate natural foraging behaviour in the wild (Rutz et al. 2007). Two adult males yielded hitherto unknown information about tool behaviour in this species. Multiple tools were used for probing leaf litter on the forest floor; a stick tool was used for a prolonged period of time and transported by flying between different ground sites; and crows made tools from dry grass stems, a raw material not previously known to be used by this species (Rutz et al. 2007). After birds acquire food, it may be stored \u2013 another behaviour not recorded among non-human primates. This behaviour indicates recognition that future conditions might change and therefore implies the existence of forethought or planning. Corvid birds exhibit a variety of complex behaviours that are related to food storage. These include food caching, shifting strategies between competing birds that both store food and thieve it, complex recovery of cached and perishable food items in fluctuating temperatures, and re-caching of food items upon observation by potential thieves (Emery and Clayton 2004; Raby et al. 2007). This range of flexible, complex behaviours rivals or exceeds that seen among great apes and has been noted both in the wild and under captive, experimental conditions. Tool manufacturing occurs spontaneously in hand-reared na\u00efve juvenile crows, demonstrating that the ability is hereditary. It does not need to be learned and is not dependent on cultural transmission. Furthermore, the routine food caching behaviour of corvids appears to exceed the ability of great apes to plan for the future. Many chimpanzee food items are highly perishable under tropical rainforest conditions, but nuts, which are a highly important seasonal component of chimpanzee diet, could be easily cached by chimpanzees while remaining edible for a fair length of time. Yet, nuts are not cached by chimpanzees. Mental abilities are subject to convergent evolution. Similar selection pressures operating on phylogenetically distant groups can create similar modes of cognition. Complex cognition in corvid birds is equivalent to that of apes but is based on completely different brain mechanisms. The nidopallium and mesopallium, brain areas analogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex, are relatively enlarged in corvids. In fact, recent investigations of avian brain anatomy reveal that birds and mammals have independently evolved brain areas devoted 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 to higher cognitive functions (Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium 2005). Thus, convergent evolution can occur in mental abilities, in spite of very divergent neuroanatomical substrates. Much consideration has been given to the existence of culture in great apes, especially in common chimpanzees. Many researchers argue that tool behaviour and other behaviours in common chimpanzees show a variability that exceeds that of any other non-human species. They also argue that this variability is probably the result of learned behaviour transmitted through social interaction \u2013 i.e., it is the result of cultural differences between chimpanzee communities. However, the list of other primate species unequivocally exhibiting cultural behaviour continues to grow. Some of the most well-known examples come from Japanese macaques, where cultural traditions such as stone collecting and sweet potato washing have been observed for nearly forty years in some troops. Yet, cultural traditions are found not only among Old World higher primates. Cultural behaviour has also been documented in New World monkeys, which are only remotely related to apes and humans (O\u2019Malley and Fedigan 2005, Y\u00e9pez et al. 2005). And cultural behaviour has been found in many non-primates. Dialect differences in birdsong that develop through social experience and practice are a well-known example of such behaviour (Alcock 2001:24\u201328). And songbirds seem to be capable of understanding novel patterns of birdsong, implying the existence of complex communication usually thought to be unique to humans (Gentner et al. 2006). It is possible that cultural traditions would be discovered in many social vertebrates, if they could attract the research attention that chimpanzees have received. Natur al History Intelligence Archaeology is the record of hominid behaviour. Hominids exhibit complex, long-distance ranging to acquire food and lithic resources, habitual tool use and modification, artefact creation, and landscape modification. These behaviours extend deep into the past. Hominid behaviour as inferred from the archaeological record represents an abrupt break from that of other Old World higher primates, and this break can be identified with the first appearance of an archaeological record between 2.6 and 2.5 mya. Although it has been claimed that chimpanzees are capable of generating an archaeological record while \u0018\u0018 Susan Cachel nut-cracking (Mercader et al. 2002), most archaeologists remain skeptical of the purported evidence. The vast majority (78%) of the stone material at the one published chimpanzee \u201csite\u201d (Panda 100) represents microshatter caused by hammerstone pounding. There is no evidence of stone flaking. Furthermore, if one argues that chimpanzee nut-cracking is a specialized ape behaviour, one must then account for the persistent high degree of tool behaviour at multiple sites by tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), New World primates only remotely related to apes and humans (Moura and Lee 2004, Fragaszy et al. 2004). Tufted capuchins use stones for digging and hammering open food resources. Hammerstones are transported to anvils, and the weight of a hammerstone can be between 19 and 50 per cent of a capuchin\u2019s body weight (Fragaszy et al. 2004). Archaeological localities dating back to 2.5\u20132.6 mya document unique hominid behaviours. What are the hominid behaviours that occur in a unique suite? Hominids select and transport raw materials for stone implements, manufacture and use stone artefacts, acquire vertebrate meat and marrow through hunting and/or scavenging (including confrontational scavenging), transport carcasses and partial carcasses, alter animal bones to obtain meat and marrow, interact with sympatric carnivore species, and leave behind spatially distinct patterns of bone and stone within a site. In the Koobi Fora region, east of Lake Turkana, Kenya, sites dating between 1.64 and 1.39 mya demonstrate alternative foraging strategies and complex foraging for dispersed resources. In areas where suitable raw material for stone tools is not available, hominids do not discard tools: tools are carefully retained or curated. Raw material for stone tool manufacture may have been a crucial resource for hominids, and the proximity of lithic raw material sources of a suitable clast size may have profoundly affected hominid ranging and foraging behaviour. Complex foraging for dispersed resources implies an intimate knowledge of the regional environment, and the ability to locate and predict the abundance of resources that fluctuate widely in space and time (Cachel 2004). A number of hominid species coexist during these time ranges in East Africa. While more than one species may have engaged in tool behaviour, the taxon Homo erectus was probably responsible for the archaeological evidence between 1.6 and 1.4 mya. As documented by the site of Dmanisi, dated to 1.8 mya, Homo erectus was capable of dispersing to the Republic of Georgia, far distant from subSaharan Africa. Dmanisi hominids were associated with animals characteristic 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 of West European assemblages \u2013 i.e., they had adapted to a novel ecosystem and were exploiting new species \u2013 and were manufacturing Oldowan tools. It is important to note that dispersion into new environments, meat-eating and hunting of new animal species, and Oldowan tool manufacture was occurring in hominids whose brain size was remarkably low, ranging from 600 to 775 cc (Lordkipanidze et al. 2007). What type of behaviour or sociality leaves behind an archaeological record? These complex behaviours mandate an attention to natural history, which is documented at an ancient date. Hominid natural history intelligence is based on complex, symbolic representation of the non-social environment and its abstract manipulation. The ability to generalize about objects and events in the outside world, to recognize patterns through the use of metaphor, to generate rules and laws about processes in the physical and biological worlds (external to the social world), to predict events, and to plan behaviours that anticipate or control these events is predicated in natural history intelligence. This intelligence functions in cognitive problems that involve anticipating properties of objects outside the social world or being able to reason about cause and effect in the world outside the social group. During early time ranges, inferences of hominid mental activity are made from degree of artefact symmetry, utility of the working edge of the artefact, prudent use of raw material, tailoring of specific raw material to specific uses, artefact retouching, and repeated use and transport (curation) of artefacts. Far later in time, beginning about 40,000 BP during the European Upper Palaeolithic, first portable and then parietal art documents the attention of its creators to fine details of the morphology and behaviour of contemporary non-human animals. By 12\u201313,000 BP, portable and parietal art even documents human awareness of individual variability and ontogenetic processes within other species, and an apparent symbolic manipulation of these properties. Animal and plant domestication would have been impossible without human attention to and manipulation of the external environment. With the advent of a written record of human thought, there is undeniable evidence of such attention and manipulation. Although even the earliest stone tools and archaeological sites indicate the presence of a distinctive type of hominid intelligence, many researchers consider that such qualitative differences in behaviour and intelligence occur very late in time. These researchers associate such differences with humans who are \u0018\u0018 Susan Cachel anatomically modern, although there may be a significant lag in time between the first appearance of such humans and archaeological evidence of art or symbolic manipulation. Neanderthals, for example, who precede and coexist with modern humans in the late Pleistocene of Europe, are frequently considered to be cognitively and behaviourally more primitive than any normal living humans and lacking any capacity for planning or forethought. Yet, primatologists routinely credit chimpanzees with forethought and planning, thus implying that chimpanzees trump Neanderthals. Unlike Mithen (1996:148), I am not separating technical intelligence (modules for tool behaviour) and natural history intelligence (modules for understanding the biological or physical worlds). I subsume both of these under the rubric of \u201cnatural history intelligence\u201d (Cachel 2006). A more fundamental difference with Mithen (1996) is that I contend that complex interaction with the biological and physical worlds demands not merely behavioural flexibility but an integration of data from multiple senses and a reorganization of neuroanatomical pathways that organize attention. This complex interaction creates the ability to monitor, to predict, and to manipulate objects and events in the natural world. As a consequence, natural history intelligence by itself contributes to the formation of general or fluid intelligence by expanding attentiveness and awareness away from the tyranny of the social world that generates the social intelligence identifiable in non-human primates. Natural history intelligence corresponds to general or fluid intelligence, highlighting the importance of planning, predicting, and manipulating items in the non-social environment. Because the constitution of awareness is a model of the world, an organism must be highly aware of the world outside of its social group and social relationships before it can model, create symbols for, predict, or manipulate the external environment. Pre-attentive neural mechanisms for processing sensory information are doubtless crucial to its functioning. These mechanisms can be subsumed under the cluster of mechanisms generally known as the \u201ccognitive unconscious.\u201d An example of such a neural mechanism is visual attentiveness in humans. Humans have been shown to possess special visual attentiveness and monitoring bias towards animals, as opposed to inanimate objects (New et al. 2007). This bias exists independently of object size, intrinsic interest, or prior expertise. Although sample targets (human, elephant, and pigeon) were small and partly camouflaged, human subjects quickly detected the targets at a rate that was significantly higher than large, bright inanimate 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 objects (farm silo, red truck, coffee mug). Humans thus exhibit unconscious preferential attention for animals and people. This differential attentiveness is thought to reflect the evolutionarily ancient importance of a category of objects (animals) that may have no function or value in the modern industrialized world (New et al. 2007). Natural history intelligence probably exists in other vertebrate species, but it does not seem well-developed in Old World higher primates, whose intelligence has been most well-studied, and which provide the bulk of the evidence for Machiavellian intelligence. With the advent of an archaeological record at 2.6\u20132.5 mya that preserves hominid behaviour (and certainly with the advent of a dense archaeological record at 1.7\u20131.5 mya), it becomes clear that hominids are behaving differently from any other primate. The Social Cognition Model Thus, natural history intelligence is not well-developed in non-human primates, even if they are closely related to humans. But the current consensus opinion is that complex sociality itself selects for intelligence in vertebrate animals (Whiten and Byrne 1997). This is the social cognition hypothesis, which argues that social dynamics and complex cognition evolved in tandem. Striving for status within the group emphasizes social manipulation, and develops reasoning abilities. Many researchers stress the existence of Machiavellian intelligence: that intelligence in primates and other vertebrates evolves from the assessment of social relationships, as well as the prediction of behaviour, and the occurrence of deceit and manipulation within a social group. According to this model, primate intelligence arises in social cognition through individual competition for dominance and resources, tactical striving for status, and \u201cpolitical\u201d manoeuvring. Because it orients non-human primate attention and awareness to happenings in the social world, Machiavellian intelligence may militate against the development of natural history intelligence, rather than contributing to its appearance. Competitive social life may enhance social intelligence, but, unless awareness of and attention to the non-social world occurs, this social intelligence will not be transferred to the world outside the social group. Cognition is ordered at the neuroanatomical level to emphasize conspecifics and social dy\u00180 Susan Cachel namics. Competitive social life consumes attention, as animals constantly strive for status. This suggests that the origins of hominid tool behaviour are rooted in a different kind of sociality than that characteristic of other Old World higher primates. Implicit in the Machiavellian intelligence theory is the idea that social intelligence is transferable to other spheres. It implies that the field of concentration is irrelevant. It assumes that striking abilities for innovation and imitation in the social realm reflect abilities for imitation and innovation in the realm outside. Yet, this is not the case for primate tool behaviour, which has been extensively investigated. Problems with the Social Cognition Model Criticisms of the social cognition model are not yet generally found in anthropology or primatology texts, but they do appear in cognitive psychology (Heyes 1993) and in European primatology (Kummer et al. 1990; Kummer 2002). Beck (1982) and Povinelli et al. (2000) direct specific arguments against the social cognition model when it relies largely or heavily on great apes, particularly chimpanzees. Consideration of emergent complexity or experiments with software and new directions in artificial intelligence also suggest problems with the social cognition model. And it is becoming clear that the competitive arena of primate social life limits attentiveness to other things. A major primatologist (Silk 2002) argues that high-ranking female monkeys launch unwarranted and randomly timed attacks against random subordinates merely to induce insecurity and stress in all subordinate animals. The dominant animals \u201cpractice random acts of aggression and senseless acts of intimidation\u201d \u2013 the title of Silk\u2019s paper. Furthermore, in spite of the famed ability of chimpanzees to form coalitions and engage in cooperative behaviour, chimpanzees do not engage in behaviours that benefit familiar but unrelated individuals under experimental conditions (Silk et al. 2005). Self-interest rules actions, and competitive social life therefore hinders the appearance of complex sociality based on reciprocal altruism \u2013 i.e., the type of sociality characteristic of humans. However, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), New World monkeys phylogenetically remote from humans, have experimentally been shown spontaneously to provision other, unrelated animals with food, even if the other animals do not reciprocate the behaviour 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 (Burkart et al. 2007). Humans and marmosets are the only two primate taxa exhibiting such altruistic behaviour. Because both humans and marmosets possess communal rearing of the young, the authors infer that reciprocal altruism arises from this breeding system. I previously predicted that communal rearing of the young like that seen among marmosets would generate complex sociality in early hominids (Cachel 2006). Several avenues of investigation raise doubt that Machiavellian social cognition in non-human primates is a necessary substrate for the origin of hominid intelligence (Cachel 2006). I will only discuss two of these here. The first line of evidence involves non-human primate behaviour, both in the field and in captivity. Vervet monkeys at the Amboseli Reserve, Kenya, are the subjects of an intensive study of non-human cognition (Cheney and Seyfarth 1990). Vervets are knowledgeable about interpersonal dynamics within their social group and are knowledgeable about vervets outside their social group. But vervets do not seem to be aware of the natural world. One intuitively expects that a species\u2019 predators would be the focus of intense scrutiny and attention. Leopard predation accounts for nearly half of vervet mortality at Amboseli in 1987. Yet, predation by leopards is not associated with vervet awareness of leopard natural history. Cheney and Seyfarth (1990) even deliberately placed a stuffed ungulate carcass in a tree, mimicking normal leopard behaviour, in order to elicit vervet response and alarm at the proximity of their most notable predator. There was no vervet reaction. And Cheney and Seyfarth document other examples of vervet unawareness of natural history (Cheney and Seyfarth 1990). Thus, despite possessing social intelligence, vervet monkeys appear to be unaware of much of their external environment and are peculiarly obtuse about making associations and predictions about the external world, sometimes despite intense positive selection pressure for them to do so. In fact, Treves and Pizzagalli (2002) conclude that predator vigilance in primates is compromised by intense vigilance directed at conspecifics. Animals spend so much time monitoring other conspecifics, trying to ascertain who is doing what to whom when, that there is no time left to monitor the environment for potential predators. The second line of evidence concerns male-female differences in primate tool behaviour. Wild adult female chimpanzees at Ta\u00ef National Park, Ivory Coast, are more proficient and persistent at opening coula and panda nuts with stone tools than males are. The argument is made that males, concerned with male-male relationships, constantly monitor the behaviour of other group \u0018\u0018 Susan Cachel members and move away from nut sites in response to other animals. Relatively non-social, individual females are not impeded by the social milieu (Boesch and Boesch 1984; Boesch and Boesch-Achermann 2000). Measurement of the energetics of nut-cracking by the Tai chimpanzees demonstrates a ninefold energy gain. Natural selection should promote this tool behaviour in both chimpanzee sexes, if other factors were not operating against it. The male need for surveillance of other males outweighs even a nine-fold energetic benefit. At Gombe National Park, Tanzania, female chimpanzees engage in termite-fishing significantly more than males, and at a younger age (Lonsdorf et al. 2004). No active teaching occurs. Yet, young females spend more time observing their mothers and eventually employ their mothers\u2019 tool behaviour techniques. Mothers interact with both male and female offspring to an equal extent, but males play more at the termite mound with other males, observe their mothers less, and engage in less termite-fishing behaviour (Lonsdorf et al. 2004). Male observation and practice time is reduced by dominance interactions rooted in sexual selection. What brain mechanisms underlie attention and attentiveness? The bifurcation between Machiavellian intelligence and natural history intelligence resembles the bifurcation between the \u201cemotional\u201d brain and the \u201cexecutive\u201d brain that is discussed in studies of primate cognition and genomic imprinting. In terms of this paper, the hormonally driven emotional brain underlies the Machiavellian intelligence that is expressed by dominance interactions and political manipulation. The executive brain underlies natural history intelligence, which is more flexible, relatively released from hormonal influences, and attentive to events outside the competitive arena of the social group. In humans, brain activation caused by emotion does not interfere with cognitive activation in the same brain area \u2013 instead, cognitive activity is enhanced, indicating that emotion can adjust activity within the same area (Gray et al. 2002). Recent human tests using functional MRI in many subjects establish that cognition and emotion are separable in humans. However, cognition and emotion are integrated in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and the integrated signal influences thought and goal-directed behaviour (Gray et al. 2002). Human lateral prefrontal cortex activity selectively mirrors emotional loads or demands, in order to maintain goal-directed behaviour at a certain level (Gray et al. 2002). 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 Implications of the Natur al History Intelligence Model Many of the elements of behaviour now often associated with the origins of anatomically modern humans (McBrearty and Brooks 2000) actually appear very deep in the archaeological record. They make their first appearance during the Oldowan between 1.4 and 1.6 mya or earlier. These elements include increased human dispersal abilities, spatial organization of behaviour at archaeological sites, primary access to animal carcasses whether through hunting or confrontational scavenging, inter-site variability, artefact change through time, and planning, as evidenced by raw material transport and curation. Researchers interested in the origin of human intelligence have traditionally focused on non-human primate tool behaviour, foraging behaviour, and sociality. Nonhuman primate sociality is widely believed to be the necessary factor in the evolution of human intelligence. However, the \u201cMachiavellian intelligence\u201d recently emphasized as typical of non-human primates may not be a necessary step in the development of natural history intelligence. Because the content of awareness is a model of the world, Machiavellian intelligence may even militate against the development of natural history intelligence. The social intelligence seen in non-human primates and humans is partly convergent or non-homologous. Applying human social terminology to the description of non-human primate social behaviour (e.g., \u201cpolitics,\u201d \u201cpolitical,\u201d \u201cMachiavellian\u201d) thwarts appreciation of the fact that human and non-human primate intelligence related to social behaviour may have disparate sources. Were the First Tools Hammerstones? What Was Being Hammered? Given the widespread use of hammerstones by animals, including primates, it is reasonable to suggest that hammerstones were the first hominid tools. If this is so, what was being hammered open? Unlike non-human primates that use hammerstones to break open hard nuts or palm nuts, early hominids may have been battering open animal bones to extract marrow. The advent of flaking \u2013 a behaviour not observed in the animal world \u2013 would allow hominids to use stone flakes to cut through skin, and sever tendons and ligaments. Hominid-modi\u0018\u0018 Susan Cachel fied bones from the earliest archaeological sites show that vertebrate meat and marrow were utilized (Dominguez-Rodrigo et al. 2005). Unequivocal dietary signatures can be obtained from the chemistry of prehistoric enamel. Stable carbon isotope and trace element analysis of enamel from South African PlioPleistocene hominid species demonstrate that all these species \u2013 australopithecines, as well as members of genus Homo \u2013 were omnivorous (Lee-Thorp and Sponheimer 2006). They incorporated meat from grass-eating vertebrates into their diets. It is important to note that modern common chimpanzees living in open, savanna environments do not consume C4 resources (Sponheimer et al. 2006). Thus, the study of common chimpanzee diet and foraging behaviour in open habitats neither resembles nor illuminates the behavioural ecology of the earliest hominids. Could australopithecines have been eating dietary items other than vertebrate meat that could generate a pronounced C4 signal? It has been suggested that either termites or sedges might yield a high C4 signature. Termite eating, in particular, immediately invokes the termite-fishing behaviour of common chimpanzees. Yet, the suggestion that termites or sedges might create a high C4 signature has been tested and found wanting. Ingestion of termites and sedges cannot account for the strong C4 signal in australopithecines (Sponheimer et al. 2005). Stable carbon isotope evidence therefore vitiates the model of termite-fishing in the earliest hominids that is based directly on chimpanzee termiting behaviour. Thus, the first tools were used to obtain food resources otherwise unobtainable by hominids. And, given the strength of the C4 signal, it is likely that vertebrate meat and marrow were not merely seasonally contingent or fall-back foods but were a normal and regular component of Plio-Pleistocene hominid diets. The presence of a strong C4 signal in all of the South African hominid species supports this interpretation. This evidence vitiates the idea that hominid tool behaviour arose during periods of resource stress, when normal food items were temporarily unavailable. This idea is based directly on the seasonality of chimpanzee nut-cracking behaviour (Boesch and Boesch-Achermann 2000). Rather, hominid tool behaviour became habitual at an early date and signified an ability to exploit food resources hitherto unavailable to primates. The lack of clear evidence for a proto-Oldowan lithic technology supports the abrupt and momentous benefit of stone tool behaviour. A major problem is to elucidate the origins of stone knapping technology because no comparative animal models yield insight into how this might have originated. Hammerstone 2: Natur al History Intelligence and Hominid Tool Behaviour \u0018\u0018 pounding creates microshatter and no useable flakes. Attentiveness to the utility of the razor-like sharpness of micro-flakes might have generated deliberate attempts to create larger, useable flakes. This attentiveness, however, could only have come about through the operation of natural history intelligence.

The Palaeolithic represents the period of the origins and early evolution of material culture in Eurasia and Africa. It extends from approximately 2.5 million years ago in Africa up until around 10,000 years ago. This timespan corresponds with global environmental cycling of the Pleistocene ice ages, as well as with the of models of the timing (tempo) and nature (mode) of change over the course of episodes of technological change. But this simple equation of biology and culture appearance and evolution of members of the genus Homo. There are a number the Palaeolithic. Most link the evolution of certain human species to single, key has been shaken by the growing realization that there was more than one human species associated with key Palaeolithic industries. This paper reviews the discussion of the origins of technology and material culture. evidence for Palaeolithic change and how these models might contribute to the \u0018\u0018 Introduction I was invited to organize a session on the origins of culture for the 38th Chacmool conference on \u201cTools of the Trade.\u201d This conference was envisaged as a mix of papers on new technologies for archaeological research, as well as a review of key aspects of world prehistory and general cultural evolution. I decided to use this opportunity as a chance to return to macro-evolutionary questions that interested me as a graduate student, which continue to influence the theoretical framework of my current research on modern human origins and the cultural record of the Upper Pleistocene in Africa. The major question is the timing and pattern of technological and cultural changes in the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age. In other words, what do we know about the tempo and mode of cultural evolution over the first 2.5 million years of our history? Partly because they deal with deep time, Palaeolithic archaeologists have drawn much of their inspiration and models from palaeontology. This paper reviews some of the issues relating to the pattern of Palaeolithic change, and how models from palaeontology and various social sciences were adapted in order to understand our remote origins. Tempo and mode are famous concepts in palaeontology. They were first explicitly used in a 1944 theoretical work by the great vertebrate palaeontologist, George Gaylord Simpson (1984). Simpson was reacting to the emergence of the modern synthesis in biology, which linked the micro-evolutionary events that geneticists could observe in the laboratory with the macro-evolutionary ones he recorded in the fossil record. He was trying to see how the two were linked, and how palaeontology, with its immense record of organisms through time, could help explicate patterns and processes underlying the evolution of life. He used tempo to refer to timing, and mode to describe the patterns or processes of change. Effectively, he was addressing the questions of when, how, and why certain events happened in the past. A similar concern has framed the development of Stone Age evolutionary models. But when transposed to the study of human cultural evolution, there are some new issues. Like many other theoretical debates in archaeology, the study of the tempo and mode of Palaeolithic technological evolution is more about how we perceive the origins of culture than what actually happened in the past. It involves an understanding of how ideas about the past are constructed and utilized, as well as how material things are interpreted. Like other his\u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby torical sciences, Palaeolithic archaeology is limited by the fact that it studies events that happened in the remote past. We cannot reconstruct this past in a laboratory; we can only study the artefacts and sites that remain. Unless we have a time machine, we will never know for sure what happened in our early history. Not surprisingly, it turns out that Simpson might have also believed this himself. After his death, it was discovered that he had written his own time machine story, The Dechronization of Sam Magruder (Simpson 1996). Using the framework developed by H. G. Wells (1949), he imagined a man from the future transported back to the Cretaceous. He observes dinosaurs and small mammals and muses on what he could do to change the course of Mesozoic evolution. Being a scientist, he engraves his observations on stone tablets that are found by people millions of years in the future. The Construction of the Palaeolithic In order to understand the tempo and mode of cultural evolution in the Palaeolithic, one must begin with a brief history of our own discipline. Prehistoric archaeological research is commonly said to begin with Christian J\u00fcrgenson Thomsen (1788\u20131865). Thomsen was the curator of the National Museum in Denmark and developed one of the first methods of classification of things, what became known as the Three Age System. He sorted artefacts by their materials into categories such as stone, bronze, and iron. He also proposed that there was a Stone Age prior to the use of metals (Thomsen 1836). In order to determine the order in which types appeared, he focused on co-associations of artefacts, especially those from closed finds (burials and other features). His resulting sequence of Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages were confirmed through stratigraphic excavations by his colleague, Jens Worsaae. Thomsen saw the Three Ages as successive stages; changes between them were the product of invasions, rather than local cultural evolution. The first of his Ages was subdivided into two phases. In the Early Stone Age, there were only stone tools. In the subsequent Later Stone Age, the first metal objects appear, as well as burials in megalithic tombs along with \u201ccrude\u201d pottery vessels with incised decorations (Trigger 1989:76\u201377). Since Denmark does not appear to have much of a Pleistocene archaeological record, modern archaeologists would now classify the former as Mesolithic, the latter as Neolithic. 3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 British and French archaeologists, who were soon uncovering evidence of very early sites, proposed their own subdivisions of the Stone Age into a number of time-successive phases. Sir John Lubbock, later Lord Avebury (1834\u20131913), proposed the creation of a Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age and a Neolithic or New Stone Age. The former was described as the age of flaked stone tools; the latter was the age of polished stone tools (Lubbock 1865). Edouard Lartet (1801\u20131871) is most famous for his palaeontological research, such as the original definition of Dryopithecus, the Middle Miocene ape of Europe. But among archaeologists, his field research in the Dordogne River Valley, along with English banker Henry Christy (1810\u20131865), is much better known (Lartet and Christy 1865\u201375). Using the association of certain index mammal species with specific stone artefact types or cultures, he created an archaeological or culture-historical sequence for Palaeolithic sites. This initially had four stages. The aurochs or wild cattle layer was the youngest; then came the reindeer phase, then the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros phase. The fourth phase, associated with the cave bear, was the oldest (Trigger 1989:95). Eventually the third and fourth phases were combined, using the site of Le Moustier as the model. Gabriel de Mortillet (1821\u20131898) was the Assistant Curator of the Museum of National Antiquities at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, outside of Paris, for seventeen years. Starting in 1876, he became the Professor of Prehistoric Anthropology, at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris. Among other tasks, he organized the prehistory exhibits for the World\u2019s Fair (Exposition Universelle) held in Paris in 1867. These were organized into rooms and were perceived as a history of work. His guidebook, Promenades pr\u00e9historiques \u00e0 l\u2019Exposition Universelle (De Mortillet 1867) offered a classification of Palaeolithic and later prehistoric stages and focused on the evolution of culture. Artefacts characteristic of each period now acted as index fossils in the same way as Lartet\u2019s mammals had earlier. By the end of the nineteenth century, there were a series of Palaeolithic stages, beginning with the Eolithic or Dawn Stone Age, the Chellean, the Acheulean, the Mousterian, the Aurignacian, the Solutrean, and finally, the Magdalenian. Most were named for specific archaeological sites that yielded distinctive assemblages of artefacts and/or associated faunal remains. \u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby Concepts of Cultur al Evolution In parallel with the discovery of human cultural evolution, the expansion of Europe led to speculation about the nature of human society. Explorers, conquerors, traders, missionaries, colonial officers, and others recorded information about the life ways of the people they encountered. These disparate accounts led to the development of anthropology as a discipline (Wolf 1982). Non-Western people were soon used as the model for the prehistoric stages that Europeans had already passed through in their move to global supremacy. For example, Sir John Lubbock\u2019s (1865) most famous book, Prehistoric Times, linked the archaeological record of Europe to the ethnographic record of aboriginal peoples worldwide; there was no distinction between archaeology and ethnology. Both were part of a universal or unilinear pattern of cultural development. This was seen as gradual and continuous, and directed towards progress and perfection. While modern Palaeolithic archaeologists would never express it in the same way, they share a perspective with the nineteenth-century founders of their field of study. Most accept the idea that changes in the archaeological record parallel stages in the evolution of our own genus Homo. It appears that when a new fossil hominid species appeared, the associated archaeological culture also changed (see, e.g., Foley 1987). On the other hand, there seems to be signs of regular change over time in technology. Production methods changed and could become more sophisticated. Prepared core methods such as the Levallois technique led to the manufacture of distinct, standardized tools. When prismatic blade tool methods were developed, the number of finished tools per piece of raw material increased significantly. This was generally explained in parallel to the evolution of the genus Homo. This was traditionally interpreted as reflecting a regular increase in human brain size over time, until it reached the modern range (Klein 1999; McHenry 1995). So it was not a surprise that archaeologists assumed that increasing brain size meant increasing technological sophistication in Palaeolithic people. Similar concepts of gradual, continuous, evolutionary change were popular in biological circles at the same time. The most important of these was Charles Darwin\u2019s (1859) concept of phyletic gradualism. The only illustration in The Origin of Species shows a series of lineages splitting and diversifying in response to changes brought about through natural selection. What was new about Darwin\u2019s model of evolution was his theory of natural selection. Individuals 3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 had variations. Natural selection acted on theses variations to promote the survival of some individuals over others. Over long periods of time, the changes in frequency of these variations would gradually lead to new species. Darwin believed that the record of the diversity of life was a product of differential reproduction. He did point out that it was difficult to test these ideas with the fossil record, as gaps were more common that complete lineages of ancestors and descendants. But he argued that this was because the fossil record itself was spotty and incomplete, disturbed by geological processes such as erosion and uplift. Not surprisingly, there were alternatives to these gradualistic models. Rather than promoting balance and equilibrium, other researchers offered a perspective of change through revolutionary processes. These models were expressed both in biological and social sciences. The most famous were promoted by Karl Marx (1964) and Friedrich Engels (1895, 1972). For the founders of communism, the various parts of a society, such as its social organization, religion, culture, and economics, were organized in different ways. The economic base was the most important aspect of society; this included how people made a living, how the means of production were socially organized, and the technology of production. Other aspects of culture were seen as epiphenomenal, including social organization and ideology. Marx and Engels promoted a model of cultural evolution that owes a lot to the nineteenth-century cultural evolutionists who founded the study of anthropology, such as Lubbock (1865), Edward Burnett Tylor (1871), and Lewis Henry Morgan (1877). Cultures evolved, they argued, through a series of socio-economic states or formations. These existed in balance or equilibrium but contained inherent internal flaws. For example, in the capitalist world in which they lived, there were two main social classes, those of workers and owners. These groups had different motives and goals and would come into conflict. The only way such a society would change, they argued, was through revolution. The product would be a new social formation, communism (or socialism), and ultimately the end of history. Marx and Engels took this model of social stasis, then rapid change or punctuation, and used it to reconstruct a series of historical stages, each progressing towards the ultimate solution. For them, there were four stages of preclass societies; these included the pre-clan, matriarchal clan, patriarchal clan, and terminal clan. Class societies emerged in classical times and continued into more recent history. The three stages of class societies included slave, feudal, \u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby and capitalist modes of production. Engels (1895; Woolfson 1982) himself wrote about human evolution in an essay titled \u201cThe part played by labour in the transition from ape to man.\u201d He took evidence from contemporary ethnographic and archaeological sources and, like de Mortillet, stressed that tools and technology were responsible for the evolution of culture and society. This brief review shows that nineteenth-century biologists and social theorists who supported ideas about evolution were split about its timing and general nature. When applied to the study of human history, evolutionary ideas became even more complicated. Twelve years after The Origin of Species was published, Darwin (1871) applied his methods of natural selection to the study of human evolution and suggested that people could also be explained as the products of natural selection. If this was taken further, it meant that people were not anything really special and had no claim to world dominance. Since all observed human groups worldwide had tools, technology, culture, and intelligence, could their biological and cultural history be explained in similar ways to that of Darwin\u2019s fellow Europeans? Tempo and Mode in Palaeontology Palaeontology, the study of the evolution of life using the fossil record, has addressed similar questions. One of the first to look at issues of what happened and why in evolution was George Gaylord Simpson (1902\u20131984). His book, Tempo and Mode in Evolution (Simpson 1984 [1944]), was aimed at the supporters of the modern synthesis in biology. This included Julian Huxley (1943), Ernst Mayr (1942), and Theodosius Dobzhansky (1937). Together with Simpson, their research in genetics and living organisms linked micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary patterns and processes. Mayr focused on the systematics of evolution and was responsible for one of the key models of how speciation could occur. Dobzhansky studied the genetics of organisms such as fruit flies, whose generations lasted only days. Among other things, Huxley concentrated on evolutionary models. Simpson was worried that most of the attention in early modern biology was on microevolution; it seemed that geneticists would be able to solve all problems in the history of life. According to Gould (1995:12), he wanted to show that palaeontology still had a role to play. It was not contradictory to genetics and could help to offer a synthesis of the two disciplines 3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 (Simpson 1984:xxii, xxvii). They were merely operating at different levels; both could help explain tempo and mode, the how and why of evolution (Simpson 1984:xxx, 74). Simpson and his successors, Eldredge and Gould (1972), continued to stress that palaeontology had time, the most important focus if one was answering questions of the rates of evolution (Fitch and Ayala 1995:iii; Gould 1995:130). For Simpson, new taxonomic groups were the products of major ecological or environmental changes; as such, they had to differ significantly from their ancestors (Simpson 1984:110). They appeared due to one of three modes of evolution: speciation, phyletic evolution, and quantum evolution (Simpson 1984:198). Speciation occurred when there was local differentiation of two or more groups within a more widespread population (Simpson 1984:199). In phyletic evolution, there was a change of population as a whole; this was most likely linear and directional (Simpson 1984:202). Quantum evolution is what Eldredge and Gould (1972; Gould and Eldredge 1977) would later call \u201cpunctuated equilibria.\u201d For Simpson (1984:206), this is \u201cthe most controversial and hypothetical\u201d aspect of his presentation. It represents \u201cthe relatively rapid shift of a biotic population in disequilibrium to an equilibrium distinctly unlike an ancestral condition\u201d (Simpson 1984:206). He saw rates of evolutionary change occurring along a continuum or bell curve, from the one extreme of low rates (brachytelic) through average rates (horotelic), to the opposite extreme of rapid rates (tachytelic) (Fitch and Ayala 1995:v; Simpson 1984). Almost thirty years later, Eldredge and Gould (1972; Gould and Eldredge 1977) used Ernst Mayr\u2019s concept of allopatric or geographic speciation to present their own discussion of rates of evolutionary change. Mayr (1942) suggested that populations at the edge of the range of a known species could become isolated by some natural event such as mountain building or the formation of a new river. Cut off from the range of the larger group, they would be subject to new pressures, so might change quicker. Eventually, genetic drift produces so many differences that they would effectively become a new species, incapable of breeding with their ancestors. Eldredge and Gould proposed that this kind of evolutionary change would involve fits and starts, rapid change with stasis in between. They labelled this model of change \u201cpunctuated equilibria\u201d and argued that it explained most of what could be seen in the geological record. Unlike Darwin, they proposed that the geological record was a good indicator of what had happened in evolution. The breaks in the fossil record were not the product of bad preservation but represented discontinuous modes or processes \u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby of evolution. Punctuated equilibria brought renewed attention on Simpson\u2019s ideas of change, which were also recognized by a conference held by the National Academy of Sciences in 1994 (Fitch and Ayala 1995). By then, cladistics or phylogenetic systematics (Hennig 1966) had become the most common framework for evolutionary research. In cladistics, biological groups are linked by descent from a common ancestor. Using shared derived anatomical traits or synapomorphies, a single innovation can be responsible for the appearance of a new lineage or clade. Cladistics emphasizes splitting and cladogenesis and forces researchers to see evolution within a framework of alternating change and stasis, much as Simpson, Eldredge and Gould originally proposed. These methods have taken evolutionary researchers in different directions. On one hand, Szathmary and Maynard Smith (1995:228) believe that the history of all life on Earth is composed of seven or eight major evolutionary transitions. The last, and arguably the most important, of these is the transformation of primate societies into human ones, through the innovation of language. Many groups developed social groups, but only humans made the final transition. They see the emergence of proto-language occurring as early as Homo erectus, a fossil human species that existed between 1.6 million and around 500,000 years ago. But for them, it is only with anatomically modern Homo sapiens that true language developed, as marked by universal grammar and semantic representation (Szathmary and Maynard Smith 1995:231). It is not clear if they see this as a rapid or gradual transformation. Whatever it was, it created something new, modern humans. An alternative perspective was taken by Edward O. Wilson in Sociobiology (1976). He saw this as the final step in the modern biological synthesis. Social behaviour would now be understood within biological terms; successful social formations were the product of natural selection, just like physical features. His goal was to break down the barrier between human evolution and the evolution of other organisms. As was the case for Darwin, there was no middle ground. People were subject to evolutionary forces, just like other organisms. This approach led to a new specialization in biology, and also in anthropology. There is now a whole theoretical school of evolutionary or Darwinian anthropology and archaeology. 3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 A Case Study: Africa and the Origins of Modern Humans How do any of these arguments fit into a study of Palaeolithic change? The archaeological record shows that the first tools were produced around 2.5 million years ago, when the first members of the genus Homo, Homo habilis, existed. Most archaeologists and palaeontologists link the two, seeing key innovations in technology when new species of Homo developed (Foley 1987; Klein 1992, 1999). The appearance of the Acheulean around 1.5 million years ago is associated with Homo erectus, while the start of prepared core technologies are associated with archaic Homo sapiens, also known as Homo heidelbergensis. Middle Palaeolithic industries began between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago and are eventually associated with Neanderthals in Europe and the Near East and with anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa (Ambrose 2001; Willoughby 2005). When anatomically modern people appear in Eurasia, around 40,000 years ago, they are associated with Upper Palaeolithic blade tools, as well as a wide range of innovations in material culture (Mellars 1991, 2005). This pattern still generally fits the evidence, but it does not tell us whether change between industries was gradual or rapid. Also, the recent return to multiple coeval species of humans begs the question of which are responsible for what kind of technology. The biggest change has been in the understanding of the role of Africa in the emergence of anatomically modern humans (Klein 1992; Stringer 2002; Willoughby 2001a, 2005, 2007). Studies of variation in mitochondrial DNA (Cann et al. 1987) and Y chromosomes (Hammer and Zegura 2002) reveal a recent common origin in Africa for all people, somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000 years ago. Descendants of these founders left Africa sometime around 40,000 years ago and replaced all other humans in Eurasia (Stringer 2002; Willoughby 2007). Most recent genetic research also supports the conclusion that there is little evidence of biologically significant variation in people worldwide. Plotting the distribution of human blood group types over space, Richard Lewontin\u2019s (1972) argued the same thing over thirty years ago. Along with the explosion of genetic studies came new chronometric (\u201ctime measure\u201d) dating techniques such as electron spin resonance and optically stimulated luminescence (Wintle 1996). These confirmed the association of anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeletal remains in Africa with Middle Palaeolithic or \u00180 Pamela R. Willoughby Middle Stone Age artefacts; both could be between 30,000 and 200,000 years old. They could even be older, as some late Acheulean industries are virtually identical to Middle Palaeolithic/Middle Stone Age ones. All of this is quite remarkable, since, with the exception of the Mugharet es Sk\u016bhl and Jebel Qafzeh in the Levant, modern humans only appear elsewhere after 40,000 years ago. Independently, the innovations in human genetics and archaeological dating created a new problem. The earliest modern Africans, while anatomically like us today, did not have the kind of technology that Palaeolithic archaeologists normally associated with behavioural modernity. Their ideas were still retained from the study of the archaeological sites in the Dordogne and V\u00e9z\u00e8re river valleys of southern France that were first examined by researchers like Lartet and Christy. Lartet himself had investigated L\u2019Aurignac, where a number of human burials were associated with artefacts that became part of the Aurignacian culture. This is now known to represent the beginnings of the Upper Palaeolithic, the period associated with the first anatomically modern people in Europe (Davies 2001). Lartet\u2019s own son, Louis, was responsible for the excavation of the Abri Cro-Magnon, the site in the village of Les-Eyzies that in 1868 yielded some of the first fossil remains of Homo sapiens and became the eponym for \u201canatomically modern human.\u201d The concept of behavioural modernity Palaeolithic archaeologists still employ today is based on European data where the appearance of anatomically modern Homo sapiens is accompanied by significant evidence of technological change. It was quite natural to expect some sort of quantum change with the onset of the Upper Palaeolithic, since Cro-Magnons were basically humans like us. Their association with new technologies was expected and helped to confirm that they were different from all other fossil hominid (or human) species. The cultural differences between Cro-Magnons and other hominids are usually expressed in a trait list of behaviours and technologies that are supposed to have their beginnings in this Upper Palaeolithic, starting around 40,000 years ago. These include (1) blade or bladelet technology; (2) more evidence of curation of tools, saving them for repeated and future use; (3) the first organic artefacts, in bone, ivory, and antler; (4) composite and hafted tools; (5) evidence of personal adornment or jewellery; (6) portable art such as Venus and animal figurines; (7) cave painting or engraving; (8) long-distance transport of raw materials and finished tools; (9) enhanced trade, exchange, and information networks; (10) regional variation in stone tool assemblages, reflecting stylis3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 tic or ethnic patterns; (11) specialization in hunting one or two species; (12) first use of fish or shellfish; (13) increasing size of residential groups; (14) more structured settlements; (15) collector/radiating rather than forager/circulating pattern of mobility; (16) the first burial sites with grave goods, or burials become more complex; (17) expansion into new territories. Finally, they are (18) associated with the skeletal remains of anatomically modern Homo sapiens (Mellars 1991, 2005). In the last two decades, the discovery that African Middle Stone Age people were anatomically modern has led to a series of new questions. If these people were skeletally like us today, then why was their technology more similar to that of the coeval Neanderthals than to the Upper Palaeolithic Cro-Magnons of Europe? Just what makes someone a modern human anyway? Is it a biological process or a cultural one? Does behavioural modernity only begin with the Upper Palaeolithic? If so, what caused the change, and can it tell us anything about tempo and mode of technological evolution? Some researchers argue for a gradual appearance of modern behavioural traits but an increasing tempo during the Upper Palaeolithic (Gamble 1994). Others, see a gradual, but Middle Stone Age, appearance of \u201cmodern\u201d behavioural traits in Africa, something that would parallel the appearance of anatomically modern people (Henshilwood and Marean 2003; McBrearty and Brooks 2000; Willoughby 2001a, 2007). Francesco D\u2019Errico (2003) takes this a step further, and argues that Neanderthals of Middle Palaeolithic Europe were also developing new technologies at the same time as their African cousins. If so, then anatomical modernity is not a factor in the creative revolution that is supposed to explain the innovations of the Upper Palaeolithic. If not, what other reasons could there be for the beginnings of these new technologies, as well as for the great \u201cOut of Africa II\u201d human migration? Richard Klein (1992) suggests that there was a sudden change in African human behaviour around 50,000 or 40,000 years ago. This was the onset of true language, symbolically based language and culture. He proposes that African Middle Stone Age people were incapable of being truly modern in their behaviour. The beginnings of the subsequent Later Stone Age mark the appearance of true modernity and also enabled the Out of Africa migration. He sees these people as carrying their new technologies and ways of life into Eurasia, supplanting the indigenous populations who had lived there for centuries. While Klein\u2019s idea is quite extreme, there is some genetic evidence for a transforma\u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby tion around this time. Studies of the FOXP2 gene (Enard et al. 2002) had shown that it underwent significant mutation either with the appearance of Homo sapiens around 200,000 years ago or even as recently as 50,000 years ago. More recent deleterious mutations in this gene are associated with specific language impairment, a disease where people are incapable of complex grammar or speech. However, it does not affect general intelligence. FOXP2 remains the first identified gene associated with language ability. Another research team has identified a gene, Microcephalin or MCPH1 (Evans et al. 2005), which maintains the large size of the human brain. It too seems to have taken on a new role with the emergence of modern people. Studies of coding areas and genes are at the frontier of modern genetic studies and may still reveal much about recent human evolution. When examining the record from Africa, things are quite murky. The Middle to Later Stone Age transition is said to be the equivalent of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic shift in Europe. But unlike Europe, it did not involve the replacement of one kind of human by another. The problem is that this period is marked by the absence of archaeological sites in most parts of Africa. It is associated with the onset of one or more glacial advances. Lakes and rivers disappeared, and deserts expanded. Regions that have dense Middle Stone Age or Middle Palaeolithic occupations include the modern coast of South Africa, the Nile Valley, and the Sahara. They have little or no sign of a human presence between around 40,000 and 18,000 years ago. In South Africa, coastal peoples might have moved south onto the continental shelf as it was exposed at the height of the last glacial. But it appears that the expansion of the Sahara led to local population extinctions. There could also be other reasons for the drop in signs of a human presence. Ambrose (1998) proposes that the explosion of Mount Toba in Indonesia around 70,000 years ago led to global cooling and a nuclear winter scenario. Whether or not glacial advances or volcanic activity was responsible, it is clear that African populations went through some sort of bottleneck near the end of the Middle Stone Age. It is more likely that they had to recover from this event before an Out of Africa migration could be initiated. How do all of these questions relate to my own field work (Willoughby 2001b; Willoughby and Sipe 2002)? In 1990, I initiated a field project examining Middle and Later Stone Age technology in Mbeya Region in southwestern Tanzania. I have recorded about one hundred open-air and rockshelter sites, 3: Tempo and Mode in the Palaeolithic \u0018\u0018 which contain artefacts from these two periods. Fieldwork has now expanded into the adjacent region around Iringa City, best known for the Acheulean site of Isimila, which was investigated in the 1950s (Howell 1961). In the summer of 2005, I observed hundreds of large granite boulder outcrops, many of which appear to have been used as rockshelters during both the Stone Age and subsequent Iron Age periods. This seems to be a good place to test Klein\u2019s (1992) hypothesis for the late emergence of behavioural modernity. Some of the Iringa sites appear to include Middle Stone Age and all later periods of human occupation, including the Middle to Later Stone Age transition. If so, this was to be a region where it might have been possible to weather the environmental shifts associated with the end of the Middle Stone Age. It is close to the highland regions of central Africa, which might have served as refugia during the driest, coolest, phases of the last glacial (Hamilton 1982). In East Africa, the effects of Upper Pleistocene glaciation may not have been severe enough to cause local extinction of human populations. If we wish to study African adaptations throughout the last glacial, this is where we should look, something Klein (1992:12, 1999:492) himself supports. But it is necessary to have transitional sites in order to test models of tempo and mode of Palaeolithic change at this critical period in human history. Our 2006 test excavations in Iringa have demonstrated that this region will allow us to determine the tempo and mode of the emergence of behavioural modernity. At one rockshelter, Mlambalasi (7\u00ba35.458\u2019S, 35\u00ba30.142\u2019E), we uncovered a relatively complete sequence, which includes the historic period and the Iron Age; the latter represents the last 3,000 or so years and is associated with the appearance in the region of farmers, with pottery, metal tools, and the first domesticated animals and plants. Under this is a microlithic white quartz Later Stone Age, which dates to the Holocene, then human remains, representing possible Later Stone Age burials. Below the burials is a macrolithic or late Pleistocene Later Stone Age, and what appears to be a terminal Middle Stone Age deposit. In all levels, organic material (bone and shell) is preserved. At the second rockshelter site, Magubike (7\u00ba45.790\u2019S, 35\u00ba28.399\u2019E), one test pit produced a sequence of Iron Age, some kind of Stone Age material, then an extensive Middle Stone deposit. A second test pit included the Iron Age and then, with no gap in the depositional sequence, up to 1.6 metres of Middle Stone Age artefacts and fossil bones. The Later Stone Age seems to be completely missing in this test pit, and there is no hiatus in deposition where it should be present. The Middle Stone \u0018\u0018 Pamela R. Willoughby Age tools are in a wide variety of volcanic rocks (everything except obsidian) and crypto-crystalline silica. Quartz is present, but only in small percentages. Most of these lithic raw materials are not found in the vicinity of the sites. As in Mbeya, Middle Stone Age people transported stone raw materials over long distances or must have had some sort of organized system of exchange. This is in direct contrast to the activities of Holocene Later Stone Age people, who made use of local resources, mainly small quartz pebbles. Our future field work will involve the determination of lithic raw material sources, as well as more extensive excavations to confirm what sort of activities were being carried out at the sites. It is also necessary to expand the culture historical information for this region, so we plan to carry out a survey for other archaeological sites. However, our preliminary results show that it is highly likely that the Iringa region was occupied by people for much of the Upper Pleistocene. Therefore, it offers real potential for the study of the trajectory of cultural change from the Middle to the Later Stone Age. It presents a good case study for the examination of the tempo and mode of cultural change at this critical period of human history.

The atlatl, with over 9,000 years use in North America, is among the principles of the atlatl, that it is a lever that increases the length of the thrower\u2019s oldest and best-known tools in the prehistoric hunter\u2019s toolkit. The fundamental arm, thereby increasing the thrust imparted to a thrown spear or dart, are equally been largely ignored. For example, virtually every atlatl found in Western North well known. However, several details regarding the atlatl\u2019s form and function have America is between 54 cm and 66 cm long, but no one appears to have examined further, yet prehistoric hunters sacrificed this potential range for some unknown why. Based on the principles of leverage, a longer atlatl should throw a dart much reason. I decided to find this reason. To do this, I carried out an experiment: I built three atlatls of varying lengths and threw with them, measuring both distance and accuracy. By comparing the results, I found strong evidence indicating that forfeit accuracy to such a degree that any increased range is useless. atlatls outside the ideal size range represented by the archaeological examples \u0018\u0018 Introduction The atlatl, or throwing stick, is among the earliest composite tools used by humans. It first appears in the French Magdalenian period (18,000\u201312,000 BP) and is known to have existed in North America for at least 9,000 years (Kellar 1955:285; Mildner 1974:7). At first glance, the atlatl appears to be quite simple: a hooked shaft used to increase the thrust of one\u2019s arm in order to propel a dart or spear with greater velocity. However, the efficiency and accuracy of performance is influenced by several factors. Previous studies (Butler and Osborne 1959; Howard 1974; Kellar 1955; Palter 1976; Peets 1960; Perkins 1989) have examined differences associated with variation in the flexibility or rigidity of the spear or atlatl as well as the use and placement of atlatl weights (bannerstones); however, variation in atlatl length has been largely ignored. Since the atlatl acts as an extension of the arm, the length of an atlatl should have a profound effect on both its distance and accuracy. Based on principles of leverage, a greater extension should result in a greater effect. If so, why is the average atlatl found in Western North America \u201cbetween 21 and 26 inches [long] with an average of something less than 2 feet\u201d (Kellar 1955:303)? Why are the atlatls not any longer? At what point might accuracy be compromised for an increase in range (and vice versa)? To address these questions, three atlatls of varying length were constructed and used to compare changes in distance and accuracy. An experimental approach was selected, as it provides an opportunity to experience the use of an atlatl firsthand, including the advantages and limitations associated with each weapon in the experiment. Furthermore, by placing strict controls on various factors of the experiment, atlatl length variation could be isolated as the primary variable, to determine if and how it influences performance. This paper will effectively demonstrate how variance in atlatl length affects both throwing distance and accuracy. Based on the results of this study, it is argued that limitations in length (as seen in North American weapons) are directly linked to the associated level of control. Longer atlatls have greater distance capabilities; however, they suffer from increased inaccuracy, making them difficult to use effectively. \u0018\u0018 Nicholas Waber The Experiment To test how atlatl length affects performance three atlatls of different lengths and six identical darts were constructed. As length was the only factor being considered, the atlatls were built using \u00be-inch hardwood dowels to eliminate any flexure. The handles were wrapped in duct tape to provide grip and a short screw was bound to the tip of each atlatl to act as a spur. The atlatls were measured and cut to 45.72 cm (18 inches), 60.96 cm (24 inches) and 76.2 cm (30 inches). These dimensions were selected because the shortest and longest are just outside the average size of North American atlatls, while the medium length is midway between shortest and longest measurements (Kellar 1955:303). If an increase in throwing range is directly proportional to an increase in atlatl length, it should be visible in the data. Atlatl darts were constructed out of 183 cm (72 inch) long and 0.95 cm thick (3/8 inch) hardwood dowels rather than by hand to achieve uniform flexibility, while facilitating the replacement of broken darts. The length of the darts was chosen because the dowels were already 183 cm long and also because they are comparable to those used by Howard in his 1974 experiments. The darts were fletched with two duct tape \u201cfeathers\u201d on either side of the shaft. These materials were selected to guarantee uniformity (Baugh 1998). Further, both access to tail feathers and fletching experience was limited. Initial construction plans also included the addition of a small weight (steel nut) to the dart point; however, it was determined that steel nuts weighed twice as much as stone points of appropriate size (about 3 grams) (Browne 1940:210). Therefore, it was determined that the construction and addition of stone points was unnecessary, based on their negligible weight. An attempt to limit the effects of weather variation was made by throwing with all three atlatls every time data was collected. The three throwers were selected on the basis of athletic competence and logistical availability. It was determined that every thrower should have a background in throwing-intensive sports such as baseball, lacrosse, or football so that they would have already developed the appropriate musculature and coordination to effectively throw with an atlatl even though none of them had any atlatl-specific experience. Also, by selecting a set of highly competitive young men (ages 18\u201324), it was ensured that they would do their utmost to outperform their fellow throwers, rather than perhaps corrupt the data by not putting in a hundred per cent effort. Apart from the experimenter, the throwers were not 4: A Game of Inches \u0018\u0018 aware of the hypothesis. All of the throwers practised throwing with an atlatl for between 60 and 90 minutes during a separate session before testing began. Distance To determine how atlatl length affected its range, each atlatl was thrown fifteen times from a set point on a level field. Distance, measured in feet, was recorded from this point to where the dart penetrated the ground. To speed the process, markers were placed at 100, 150, 200, and 250 feet. Uniformity in dart trajectory was attempted during each throw. Observations: As predicted, longer atlatls achieved greater distances (Figure 4.1). However, it appears that the benefits taper off as length increases. As demonstrated in Figure 4.1, there are substantial differences between the short and medium atlatl and between the short and long atlatl; however, the difference between the medium and long atlatl is considerably less. This is likely due to increased resistance associated with wielding a longer, heavier atlatl as well as the weight of the dart shifting the centre of balance away from the thrower\u2019s hand. At some point, further lengthening of the atlatl no longer increases throwing range. Moreover, each of the throwers remarked on the \u201cclumsiness\u201d and \u201cawkwardness\u201d of the longer atlatl, as well as increased muscle fatigue when using this weapon. Interestingly, the short atlatl had similar effects on the throwers. The comparably light weight of the small atlatl resulted in the throwers exerting too much force with comparatively little resistance. This was especially true when a thrower used the short atlatl after using the longer one. The individual would attempt to throw the dart with as much force as required for the longer atlatl and would become frustrated by the relative impotence of the short atlatl. In subsequent attempts, he would try to throw the dart even harder with disappointing results. This was likely not a factor that affected prehistoric hunters, as it is presumed that they would not switch between different weapons when hunting. The medium atlatl reached distances comparable to those of the longest one, without awkwardness or exhaustion. It was the easiest to use and felt well balanced with the 183 cm dart when held back in preparation for the throw. \u0018\u0018 Nicholas Waber Figure 4.1. Long, medium, and short atlatl distance measurements in metres. Note the substantial difference between the short and medium atlatls, and the significantly less substantial difference between the medium and long. Accur acy To examine the effects of atlatl length on throwing accuracy, darts were thrown at a target, 100 cm high and 60 cm wide, from a distance of thirty metres. The lateral and longitudinal distance between the target and where the dart entered the ground was measured and recorded. Observations: As expected, the long atlatl was the least accurate, while the shortest was consistently the most accurate. The medium atlatl scored the most hits; however, it also showed the greatest inconsistency and broadest range of misses (see Figure 4.2). When trying to hit the target, the most difficult factor was trying to determine the force necessary to throw the dart thirty metres. Keeping the dart on a straight path towards the target was relatively easy, but overthrowing was common. Of 90 throws (84 misses), 54 missed within 2 metres of the target side-to-side, while only 27 were within 2 metres of the distance. 4: A Game of Inches \u0018\u0018 Figure 4.2. Long, medium, and short atlatl accuracy measurements, representing the distance the target was missed by in metres. The lower the number, the closer the spear landed to the target. As discussed previously, the long atlatl is unwieldy. This difficulty becomes apparent when attempting to hit such a small target. The dart must be aimed near to the ground so as not to overshoot the target. Unfortunately, the high degree of force necessary to throw with the long atlatl makes precision aiming and consistent throwing extremely difficult. The short atlatl suffers from a similar problem. While it is the most consistent, it is likely due to the range of thirty metres rather than any beneficial aspect of the short atlatl. One must exert nearly as much force to throw the dart thirty metres on a relatively straight, flat trajectory as one must exert to throw it on a higher, arcing trajectory for maximum range. Therefore, with nearly every throw, the thrower is required to use full force. As demonstrated with the long atlatl, aim becomes extremely difficult when exerting a great deal of force. The high consistency in the short atlatl\u2019s performance is a direct result of the limited velocity associated with the flatly-thrown darts, which could not carry them far past the target. Using the medium atlatl, with comfortable balance, handling and the potential to throw twice the distance to the target, we found that we were frequently overthrowing, then overcompensating on subsequent throws. This resulted in the wide range of misses observed. \u0018\u0018 Nicholas Waber Discussion The variable factors contributing to atlatl performance are by no means a new topic of research in the archaeological community. Numerous studies have been carried out in the past, providing us with a variety of theories regarding the mechanisms behind atlatl function. Bob Perkins (a.k.a. \u201cAtlatl Bob\u201d) has put forward a theory regarding flex as thrust in atlatl systems (Perkins 1989). As outlined by the theory, the energy stored in the flexed dart is used to push the projectile away from the launching platform, providing the dart with the necessary velocity. The atlatl is simply a means of accelerating the base end of the dart in order to achieve the desired flexure (Perkins 1989). While dart flexure is important, it has more to do with maintaining trajectory than increasing thrust potential. The oscillation of the dart in flight, like a conventional arrow, serves to keep the projectile flying point-on, rather than turning upwards or downwards. Flexibility is key, however, as even with a flexible dart atlatls of differing lengths will perform differently. Perkins also suggests that the bow and atlatl are essentially the same type of weapon in terms of physicality and mathematics (Perkins 1989). The only difference is that the bow accelerates the flexible shaft in a straight path, while the atlatl accelerates it in an arc (Perkins 1989). This is not true, as both the bow and the atlatl accelerate the shaft in a straight path. The atlatl is not used as a catapulting device; instead, it is dragged behind the throwing hand and flipped forward as the thrower\u2019s arm extends. An arcing path would not only deprive the dart of most of its power but would also decrease its accuracy a great deal. The main result that comes from throwing with an arcing motion is that the dart is not forced to flex and, as a result, \u201cstalls\u201d soon after release; that is, it sweeps upwards, quickly losing momentum and falls to the ground with no more force than if it had been thrown by hand. Other atlatl experiments (Howard 1974:102) have found similar results when an arcing motion was used rather than a level throwing motion. Finally, Perkins mentions that the atlatl itself is generally flexible and can be fine-tuned by adjusting the position of the bannerstone and the atlatl\u2019s flexure to match that of the dart (Perkins 2001, personal communication). Perkins uses the analogy of a diver and diving board to explain this theory, in that the inertia resulting from the mass of a projectile point causes the dart to flex, storing \u201cspring energy,\u201d which is released, pushing the dart away during the 4: A Game of Inches \u0018\u0018 throw. However, there are many factors to consider: unless a projectile point is significantly oversized (which would negatively affect the entire balance of the atlatl/dart system), the distal end of the dart does not produce enough inertia to mimic a bouncing, bending diver (the centre of gravity for an atlatl dart generally being quite close to the proximal end), the diving board flexes to a much higher degree than an atlatl and perhaps most importantly, the entire diving board and platform are not being flung in an overhand motion, releasing the diver well before the board would have the opportunity to unflex. While dart flexibility is an important factor in atlatl performance, it may not be as crucial as Perkins implies. Calvin Howard (1974) put forth a theory that throwing spears or darts with an atlatl is more effective than throwing by hand because the atlatl provides a firmer grip on the dart while increasing the duration of contact between the thrower and the dart. As a result, the thrower may exert force on the dart for a longer period of time (Mason 1885 in Howard 1974:102). The results of the current study suggest that these attributes are false. First, it is not difficult to grip the shaft of a 183-cm-long, 0.95-cm-thick dart by hand, nor is it difficult to throw. The difficulty comes in throwing hard enough to propel the dart a greater distance. It is not possible to propel the atlatl fast enough to give the light-weight dart the thrust necessary to carry it further than a few metres. Finally, the duration of contact between the thrower and the dart is virtually identical whether the dart is thrown by hand or with an atlatl. This is what makes the atlatl effective; it causes the dart to move further in the same amount of time (and therefore accelerate more rapidly) than when it is thrown by hand. The atlatl adds its effective length (the distance from the thrower\u2019s hand to the hook at the distal end, not the distance from the proximal end to the distal end) to the thrower\u2019s arm, and thus increases the distance the hook travels during a throw (see Figure 4.3). In the current study, the difference between the hand when reaching back to throw and at the point of release is approximately 90 cm. When holding a 60.96 cm (24 inch) atlatl (50.8 cm effective length) the distance becomes 140.8 cm. The duration of contact during the throw is approximately 0.3 seconds. Thus, the 60.96 cm atlatl increases the thrust behind the dart by approximately 1.69 metres per second (4.69 m/s, rather than 3 m/s). If this is true, then the length of the atlatl should be directly proportional to the velocity increase at the point of contact with the dart. It should be noted that with a regular overhand throw, the dart is generally released in an arcing \u0018\u0018 Nicholas Waber Figure 4.3. The atlatl as an extension of the thrower\u2019s arm. motion before the arm follows through. This is also the case when the atlatl is used; the dart is released just as the atlatl begins its follow-through. It is important to examine the difference between an arcing motion and a straight trajectory more closely in order to understand why a catapulting motion would under-power a dart. At first glance, applying the above formula would suggest that the arc would actually produce a higher velocity than a straight trajectory. In order to move the tip of the atlatl from the ready to throw position to the release point 140.8 cm away, the tip would arc along a path roughly 221 cm long. This calculation is reached by viewing 140.8 cm as the diameter of a circle (which the arcing atlatl tip would travel if it kept going) and applying the 4: A Game of Inches \u0018\u0018 formula for determining the circumference of a circle (c = \u03c0d) and dividing it in half, as the tip of the atlatl would only travel through 180 degrees of the arc. Unfortunately for proponents of the arc-motion theory, this throwing action would result in the dart being plunged into the ground directly in front of the thrower. For the arcing atlatl to effectively catapult the dart, the thrower would have to abruptly stop the atlatl roughly perpendicular to the desired trajectory. This would result in the atlatl tip travelling through 90 degrees (or less) of the arc. Thus, at best, an arcing motion could move the dart 110.5 cm, resulting in roughly a 22-per-cent decrease in potential velocity from a straight trajectory launch. Conclusions The atlatl is among the oldest and best-known weapons in the prehistoric hunter\u2019s toolkit. While the fundamental principles of this weapon system are well-known, there are several attributes, such as the importance of atlatl length, which have not received consideration. As suggested by the principles of leverage, increased length should result in an increase in range. From the experiments above, it is clear that throwing range increases with atlatl length. However, the benefit of increased range is not directly proportional to length, as this decreases beyond a certain limit. As the length of the atlatl increases beyond the ideal range, so does the inaccuracy of the dart. Specifically, a longer, heavier atlatl is difficult to use, rendering it less efficient than a smaller one, regardless of the fact that it can launch a dart farther. Smaller atlatls are equally inefficient. They do not exhibit the range or power of the longer varieties and their short range accuracy is largely due to an inability to overshoot the target. Therefore, an atlatl of medium length provides both greater range and increased accuracy. The lengths of archaeological examples of North American atlatls range between 53 cm and 66 cm long, which correspond with the medium length atlatl used in this study. This would provide hunters with maximum range and increased accuracy. Medium length atlatls would also be comfortable to use and would not exhaust the thrower should the situation call for an extended period of use. The importance of the atlatl to prehistoric subsistence is demonstrated by its widespread and continued use for over 9,000 years. Numerous studies have \u00180 Nicholas Waber been conducted in an effort to develop a clear understanding of the form and function of this effective tool. To date, researchers have addressed factors such as the importance of dart and atlatl flexure and bannerstone placement (Perkins 1989; Perkins 2001, personal communication), while others have attempted to understand the atlatl mechanics through technological comparison (Howard 1974). Based on the results of the present study, it is clear that tool length is an integral factor in atlatl dynamics. The importance of range and accuracy suggests that prehistoric hunters had an established understanding of the length necessary to create the most effective hunting tool. While the atlatl follows the principles of leverage, it is clear that human experience (trial and error) plays an equally important role in technological innovation. Therefore this study demonstrates the importance of firsthand observation and the utility of experimental archaeology for understanding the past.

Gryba and Purple Kumai Abstract. Experiments undertaken on different materials with raw and heattreated Glass Buttes, Oregon, semi-translucent obsidian revealed significant differences in resulting patterns of use-wear. Microblade replication results are used treated rather than raw obsidian in the manufacture of certain types of artefacts. interpretation of obsidian artefacts recovered from archaeological contexts. to show how prehistoric knappers could have greatly benefited by utilizing heatIt is suggested that the general results of both these studies be considered in the \u0018\u0018 Introduction This paper describes the results of microscopic examinations, use-wear experiments and microblade replications conducted on raw and heat-treated semitranslucent obsidian from Glass Buttes, Oregon. The project was initiated as an undergraduate term paper by Kumai. Her objectives were to investigate, through microscopic examinations and use-wear experiments, if there were recognizable similarities or differences between raw and heated obsidian and to identify the attributes that would distinguish the two samples from one another. Gryba heat-treated the samples. He chose replication of microblades as a way to demonstrate to Kumai how prehistoric knappers could have benefited by using heat-treated rather than raw obsidian for the manufacture of certain tools. Because it involved obsidian from only one bedrock source, the results of this study must be considered preliminary. In addition, the findings have yet to be applied to the analysis and interpretation of obsidian artefacts recovered from archaeological context. Heat-Treating Obsidian In previous knapping trials, Gryba discovered that heat treatment significantly improved the ease with which the semi-translucent variety of obsidian from Glass Buttes was flaked by direct hand pressure. This observation lends support to ethnographic accounts of North American aborigines applying heat treatment to obsidian. These include General J. W. Powell\u2019s observation of Plateau Shoshone, Voegelin\u2019s account of the Western Shasta, Foothills Nisenan, and Valley Maidu of northern California, as well as Grinnell\u2019s record of an unspecified Northern Plains tribe located north of the Crow (Hester 1972:63\u201364). Neither Gryba nor Kumai are aware of any published archaeological reports in which it was determined that heat-treated obsidian had been used for the manufacture of microblades. There is, however, widespread evidence from sites in Siberia and North America where microblade manufacturers had applied heat treatment to improve the workability of chert or other lithic types. It includes three Late Palaeolithic microblade-bearing sites in the Aldan River region of east-central Siberia (Flenniken 1987:121), the 10\u201312,000 BP Ustinovka I site north of Vladivostok (Kononenko et al. 1998), and possibly the Campus \u0018\u0018 Eugene M. Gryba and Purple Kumai site at Fairbanks (Mobley 1991:25). In addition, microblades of Beaver River Sandstone, recovered from undated sites in the Fort MacKay area of northeastern Alberta, display unmistakable signs of having being made from stone that had been deliberately heat-treated (Gryba 2002). Given the broad temporal and spatial occurrences of microblade technologies throughout the volcanic belts that border the North Pacific (e.g., Fladmark 1985; Giddings 1964; Kobayashi 1970; Kuzmin et al. 2002), what would have prevented prehistoric knappers there from applying heat treatment to improve the workability of obsidian? Samples of Glass Buttes obsidian were heated in an electric kiln. Optimum pressure flaking quality was attained when the stone was heated to around 750\u2013800\u00b0 F (ca. 325\u2013350\u00b0 C). This is a temperature range within which Gryba had successfully heat-treated Swan River Chert, Cat Head Chert, and Beaver River Sandstone. Only samples of raw obsidian and those that had been heattreated to their optimum flaking quality were selected for this project. Microscopic Studies and Use-Wear Experiments Kumai prepared thin sections at the University of Calgary geology lab and examined them under a low-powered microscope. Cutting, scraping and sawing experiments were carried out with 3\u20135 cm large unmodified flakes of both raw and heat-treated obsidian. Materials used for the experiments included a soft fibrous material (rutabaga), lilac wood, and bone. Each flake was used for approximately 1,000 strokes. In the sawing experiments, a back and forth motion was considered a single stroke while in cutting and scraping trials the motion was directed only toward the body. Resulting use-wear patterns were prepared for microscopic examination by applying a thin layer of latex to the used edge or surface of the flake. The latex was then peeled off with film, mounted on a slide, and examined under a microscope. Photographs were taken of each prepared slide using Tungsten ASA 64 slide film. 5: Microscopic and Use-Wear Studies \u0018\u0018 Results of Microscopic Studies and Use-Wear Experiments The general findings of the microscopic studies and use-wear experiments are summarized in Table 5.1. An examination by microscope and the unaided eye showed no visible changes in crystal structure or colour between raw and heattreated samples of obsidian. New flake scars on heated obsidian exhibited fewer ripple marks and fewer and smaller fracture fissures, and they were slightly more lustrous than those on raw obsidian. Table 5.1: General observations between raw and heat-treated Glass Buttes obsidian.

Much of the damage occurred at the base of fracture fissures. This trait was not usually observed on flakes of heat-treated material utilized in the same manner and suggests that heat treatment makes obsidian tougher and more resistant to breakage (Figures 5.1 to 5.4). \u0018\u0018 Eugene M. Gryba and Purple Kumai Figure 5.1. Comparison of use-wear damage on raw obsidian (left) and heat treated obsidian (right) that resulted from sawing a rutabaga. Figure 5.2.

A series of parallel striations formed on a flake of heat treated obsidian used for sawing bone. On a flake of heat-treated obsidian that was used to saw bone, some striations formed parallel to the utilized edge. These small grooves (Figure 5.5) may have been caused by grit, which had adhered to the flake, or by bits of obsidian that had become detached during the sawing process. In a similar experiment, a raw flake used exhibited extensive micro-shatter along the edge, but no striations (Figure 5.4). Polish was not noticed on any utilized flakes of raw obsidian but was observed on a heat-treated flake used to saw a lilac branch. 5: Microscopic and Use-Wear Studies \u0018\u0018 Microblade Replication Experiment Results Microblades were produced from raw and optimally heat-treated samples of obsidian by a simple free-hand pressure technique that entailed use of ca. 5\u20137.5 cm long antler flakers (Figures 5.6 and 5.7). Figure 5.6. A core and microblades replicated from raw Glass Buttes obsidian. Figure 5.7. A core and microblades replicated from heat treated Glass Buttes obsidian. \u00180 Eugene M. Gryba and Purple Kumai A summary of the results is presented in Table 5.2. Heat-treated Glass Buttes obsidian proved much easier to work by direct hand pressure than did the raw material. As a result, larger pressure flakes and microblades could be detached from heat-treated obsidian than from raw samples. Also, because heated obsidian tended to be more durable; microblades did not usually break during detachment. Blades pressed off from heat-treated obsidian, when compared to those made from raw obsidian, exhibited a smoother fracture (i.e., displayed less rippling), showed less platform crushing, had a smaller and generally shallow bulb of percussion, hinged short less frequently, and were straighter in longitudinal profile. Because less force had to be exerted during detachment, microblades from heat-treated obsidian did not usually break during \u201cpressure follow-through\u201d as was frequently the case where raw material was used. In addition, considerably less micro-shatter was produced during microblade manufacture from heat-treated obsidian than was the case where raw material was used. Table 5.2: Similarities and differences between microblades and cores replicated from raw and from heat-treated Glass Buttes obsidian. R aw He aT-TR e aTed Require more pressure to detach Shows some platform crushing Some crushing of negative bulb Bulb of percussion may be pronounced Blades may break with hinge fracture Blades tend to break during removal due to pressure follow-through Blades may have a curved longitudinal profile Cores develop curved fluted face Fluted face may show hinge fractures Much easier to press off Very little platform crushing Less crushing of negative bulb Bulb less pronounced (i.e., less \u201coverhang\u201d) Fewer blades broke with hinge fracture Blades tend to remain intact; many just \u201cpop off\u201d Blades are straighter in longitudinal profile Fluted face tends to remain straight Few hinge fractures on fluted face 5: Microscopic and Use-Wear Studies \u0018\u0018 When the microblade core is considered, these replication experiments demonstrate that there were obvious advantages for prehistoric knappers to have used heat-treated rather than raw obsidian. Because most microblades pressed from heat-treated obsidian tended to be complete and straighter, there was less need to reshape the fluted face to correct the core for hinge fractures or excessive curvature. If a blade broke short with a hinge fracture, there was always the risk that, if one of the lateral ridges created by a failed blade was utilized to guide the next blades, then there was greater chance that they, too, would hinge short. Correcting the fluted surface for hinge fractures or excessive curvature would have involved a significant amount of time as well as loss of material. In a worse case scenario, a misdirected blow could even have resulted in damage to the core to the point where it would have had to be discarded. It is acknowledged that variations in metric dimensions, longitudinal curvature, or blades terminating in a hinge fracture may be due to variables such as the skill of the knapper, initial size or configuration of the core, flaws in the stone, type of flaker used, and so on, instead of whether the obsidian had or had not been heat-treated. Even microblades Gryba produces from heat-treated or raw obsidian can display a wide variability in size, shape, or completeness. But, by using heat-treated rather than raw obsidian, he discovered that he can greatly lower the incidence of blades hinging or shattering and reduce their longitudinal curvature. Summary and Conclusions Studies by Gryba and Kumai demonstrated that heat treatment significantly improved the workability of Glass Buttes semi-translucent obsidian, and that use-wear and replicative experiments can be very useful interpretive tools for distinguishing raw from heat-treated obsidian. Whether all varieties of obsidian respond as positively to heat treatment as does the semi-translucent Glass Buttes variety, how extensively in time and space was heat treatment actually applied by prehistoric knappers, and what types of artefacts were manufactured from raw or from heated-treated obsidian are issues that remain to be researched. It is suggested that before researchers can even start speculating on the manufacture or function of certain obsidian artefacts, they should first establish if the stone the tools were made from had or had not been heat-treated, as this likely deter\u0018\u0018 Eugene M. Gryba and Purple Kumai mined the type of flaking technology employed in their manufacture, or their function or functions and the types of use-wear patterns created on them. After this project was largely completed, Gryba conducted heat-treatment experiments on Hoodoo Mountain, Yukon, obsidian. Preliminary results of microblade replication and general pressure flaking trials tentatively suggest that heat treatment does not improve Hoodoo Mountain obsidian to the degree that it does Glass Buttes obsidian. Use-wear experiments on Hoodoo Mountain obsidian remain to be undertaken and reported. References Cited Fladmark, Knut R. 1985 Glass and Ice: The Archaeology of Mt. Edziza.

During archaeological reconnaissance in the west-central foothills of Alberta, and during the excavation of site FgQf-16, a newly defined stone tool has emerged. The Embarras Bipoint is associated with the Mummy Cave Complex op\u00e9ratoires of their manufacture, I will demonstrate that this new stone tool type has diagnostic qualities, which can be used to further our understanding of the Eastern Slopes culture history of Alberta. of the Early Middle Period. Through replicative studies and creation of cha\u00eenes \u0018\u0018 Introduction From the archaeological reconnaissance in west central Alberta and the excavation of sites such as FgQf-16, FgQe-16, and FgQf-62 a new stone tool has been defined. The Embarras Bipoint dates to the Early Middle Period, which is between 7,500 and 5,000 years before present. To date I have been able to identify over fifty Embarras Bipoints (for examples, see Anderson and Reeves 1975; Calder and Reeves 1977; Calder and Reeves 1978; Hunt 1982; McCullough 1982; Meyer et al. 2002; Meyer 2003; Meyer et al. 2007; Meyer and Roe 2007; and Van Dyke and Stewart 1985). These fifty plus stone tools are remarkable in that they share a unique technological patterning as well as an overall morphology that distinguish them from other stone tools. This paper is a condensed overview of the ongoing research I have been doing with Embarras Bipoints for my master\u2019s thesis at the University of Saskatchewan. As such I will provide a brief overview of the geographical and temporal distribution of Embarras Bipoints. This will be followed by a discussion on the replicative experiments being conducted and a synopsis of cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire as the theoretical approach relates to the analysis of Embarras Bipoints. Last, there will be a sampling of some of the areas I have and will be studying involving Embarras Bipoint technology. This will demonstrate that Embarras Bipoints are stone tools with diagnostic qualities, which can be used to better understand the culture history of the Eastern Slopes of Alberta as well as some of the lithic technological practices of the Early Middle Period. Thus far, Embarras Bipoints have been found in association with Mummy Cave Complex diagnostic artefacts of the Early Middle Period. As anyone familiar with this time period can attest, there is a wide range of projectile point forms. One has only to review the Gowen Site report (Walker 1992) or the literature on the Mummy Cave Site (i.e., Husted and Edgar 2002; McCraken et al. 1977) to appreciate the diversity of projectile point forms. One interesting observation that has come to light during discussions with Dr. E. Walker (personal communication, 2007) and that will be explored in Roe (n.d.) is the possibility that Embarras Bipoints and other temporally affiliated tools may date to the transition period between Mummy Cave and Oxbow complexes. A number of Oxbow-like projectile points, for example, have been recovered in direct association with Mummy Cave projectile points (see Meyer and Roe \u0018\u0018 Jason Roe 2007:33; Cyr 2006:12). A more exact temporal link will hopefully emerge as research continues. In order to do a technological analysis of Embarras Bipoint manufacturing practices, there had to be an archaeological dataset that encompassed the entire reduction sequence. This was one of the reasons for excavating site FgQf-16. Situated south of the hamlet of Robb, the Upper Lovett Campsite, or FgQf-16, is located on a south-facing ten-to-fifteen-metre terrace, at the confluence of the Lovett River and Ronaghan Creek. The excavation, headed by Dr. Daniel Meyer, started in the summer of 2005 and finished in the summer of 2006. The excavation was done on a volunteer basis with financial support from the Alberta Historic Resources Foundation, Lifeways of Canada Limited, and Hinton Wood Products. A total of fifty-four one by one metre units was excavated producing 18,762 artefacts, which included a number of diagnostic projectile points, a suite of other interesting stone tools, and most importantly Embarras Bipoints. These data are supplemented by excavated materials from FgQe-14 and 16 (Calder and Reeves 1977), FgQf-10 (Hunt 1982), and FhQ g-2 (Calder and Reeves 1978), as well as over a dozen isolated finds along the Eastern Slopes (Meyer 2003; Meyer and Roe n.d). The number of Embarras Bipoints increases when sites away from the Eastern Slopes such as EgPm-179 (Van Dyke and Stewart 1985) are included. This clearly demonstrates not only that there is a significant archaeological dataset to conduct a technological analysis of Embarras Bipoints but that this artefact type also has a wide geographical distribution across the landscape. Thus far, the geographical extent of Embarras Bipoints appears to be focused mostly in and along the Eastern Slopes, but predictably these stone tools have been or will be found along major waterways outside my main study area. Attributes of Embarr as Bipoints What is an Embarras Bipoint and why are these stone tools unique? There are three key morphological attributes and one technological features that make Embarras Bipoints unique; they include shape, size, material type, and flaking pattern (Figure 6.1). Other attributes such as transverse cross-section, lateral edge shape, and overall symmetry are important characteristics, but the following discussion will focus on the four main features. 6: Making and Understanding Embarr as Bipoints \u0018\u0018 Figure 6.1. Examples of Embarras Bipoints found along the eastern slopes of Alberta (figure from Meyer 2003). The planview shape of an Embarras Bipoint is, obviously, bipointed. Other features associated with the overall shape include sinuous, excurvate lateral edges and a bi-convex to plano-convex transverse cross-section. In some cases the shape can range from oval to lanceolate, the symmetry can be skewed and the \u2018points\u2019 can be relatively rounded, but there is always a bipointed appearance (Figure 6.1: FgQf-16-1). As a matter of fact, since D. Meyer first named these tools in 2003, there have been numerous discussions of whether the term \u2018bipoint\u2019 could be slightly misleading (D. Meyer; personal communication). Nonetheless, even if an Embarras Bipoint does not have a \u2018classic\u2019 bipointed appearance (Figure 6.1: FgQe-16-289), one should have no difficulty identifying these stone tools by their bipointed shape. Size is another distinguishing trait of Embarras Bipoints. Comparably they are larger than most stone tools, excluding large choppers, mauls, and hammerstones. Their size is directly related to their use as a hand-held tool (which I will briefly discuss later in the paper). The average length of an Embarras Bipoint \u0018\u0018 Jason Roe is 11 cm with the largest example being 15.3 cm and the smallest measuring 7 cm. The average width is 5.5 cm with the largest width being 8.6 cm and the shortest width being 3.4 cm. The average thickness ranges from 0.6 cm to 2.7 cm with the average being 1.3 cm. This clearly demonstrates that Embarras Bipoints are large stone tools, even when compared to other characteristically large stone tools, such as expedient choppers or large projectile points. The toolstone used to manufacture the Embarras Bipoint is significant because all of the examples have been manufactured from locally derived sources. The lithic material used for the majority of the known examples has been very finegrained quartzite with a lesser number being made from Nordegg Member Silicified Siltstone, Glacier Pass Silicified Mudstone, crystalline siltstone, and possibly Banff Silicified Siltstone. The decision to use local raw materials is not only interesting but supports the general notion that Early Middle Period peoples had a preference for locally derived resources. The use of quartzite as the main toolstone for making Embarras Bipoints is also interesting from a functional perspective. As a tool that appears to have been used in a multitude of tasks from cutting to scraping and gouging to drilling, a durable material works best. Quartzite is often referred to as an inferior raw material when compared to cherts, agates, and chalcedonies. However, as my thesis work will hopefully show, and I will only mention here, this is not necessarily true. The idea that to create a sharp edge requires a cryptocrystalline material, ideally obsidian, is erroneous and completely overlooks the fact that the sharpness of the working edge is not the only attribute of importance. Based on my personal experience, the edge of a quartzite flake may not be as sharp as that on an obsidian flake, but it is still sharp enough to perform most, if not all, of the same tasks. Perhaps then, the other benefit of using quartzite over most other toolstones is that this raw material is far more durable. The last point to be made about the use of locally derived lithic materials, more specifically quartzite, is the higher than normal amount of very high quality lithic materials in the Hinton region in comparison to other areas of Alberta. One of the reasons Early Middle Period groups, and other earlier and later groups, remained in or frequently returned to this area could have been the availability of good knappable quartzite. So along with all of the other available resources, people would have been attracted to the area by the availability of high-quality toolstone for the production of the Early Middle Period tools, such as Embarras Bipoints or Reverse Unifaces. 6: Making and Understanding Embarr as Bipoints \u0018\u0018 The most informative technological and morphological characteristic of Embarras Bipoints is the noticeable consistency in the reduction sequence resulting in a similar tertiary stage flake patterning. For example, all of the known Embarras Bipoints have large, random, comedial, soft hammer percussion flake scars. Also, the sinuous edge, common to them all, is the result of removing flakes with edge bite striking platforms. A flake with an edge bite platform is created by soft hammer percussion where the fracture initiates well in from the lateral edge because the energy required to initiate a fracture at the edge is too great creating a exaggerated planview concavity on the edge (Whittaker 1994:189\u2013190, 194). This characteristic, although very common with Embarras Bipoints, is more likely a result of the toolstone than the inferred behaviour of the maker. More specifically, the most diagnostic technological trait on all the Embarras Bipoints is the more complex scar patterning on the dorsal surface as compared to the ventral surface. As such, Embarras Bipoints are stone tools that are predominantly worked on the dorsal side with accessory shaping and thinning on the ventral side. In other words, a large portion of the flake scarring on the ventral surface involves shaping, the removal of the bulb of percussion, or platform preparation for removing flakes from the dorsal surface. There are a number of avenues that can be explored because of this technological trend. For example, during the quarrying and/or the primary stages of production, were spalls requiring the least amount of modification to get the most common transverse cross-section (i.e., plano-convex and/or bi-convex) consciously selected or were spalls extensively modified to obtain this type of cross-section? Will the ratio of flake scarring on the dorsal surface versus the ventral surface be diagnostic of Embarras Bipoints? How do these operational sequences vary from those used for the other stone tools associated with the Early Middle Period? What about the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire for stone tools from other periods of time and other places? Before continuing I will quickly address one of the most pressing questions about Embarras Bipoints and that is their function. The one solid interpretation I have of their use is definitely not as projectile points. The overall size of the tool is much too large to be used as part of a projectile system. Thus far, there has been no evidence for hafting, such as edge-grinding. Third, evidence of usewear is generally consistent with tasks such as cutting, scraping, and chopping. This is why I believe Embarras Bipoints were used as a hand-held multi-purpose \u00180 Jason Roe tool, possibly as a core tool where flakes removed from the dorsal surface were used in an expedient fashion. To fully address this question requires more work and so will be left to future research. Approaches to the Study of Embarr as Bipoints There are a numerous ways to study lithic artefacts. This paper will explore two approaches, one methodological and the other theoretical, that I believe are the most appropriate for studying Embarras Bipoints. The first approach is through replicative studies. I have been an avid flintknapper for over a decade and from this experience I have learned two principles. One, there is an emic perspective to modern flintknapping referred to as \u201ca community of practice\u201d by Whittaker (2004:113\u2013114). This may not be the same emic perspective flintknappers had in the past, but dealing with a flaw in the stone or a snapped biface are obstacles, which have to be addressed both in the present and the past. The second principle is that modern flintknappers can have an intimate understanding of technological behaviour(s). Having the ability to visualize and know how a piece needs to be held and the type of swing necessary to produce a long, wide, soft hammer percussion flake has greater interpretive potential than knowing a billet hitting a stone produces a flake. Arguably these principles of studying lithic reduction come with many biases, but, then again, any theoretical or methodological approach comes with inherent biases. How these biases are addressed in any study becomes the hallmark of good research. As mentioned earlier, one of the telltale characteristics of Embarras Bipoints is the technological similarity visible on finished tools. This is why the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire approach is the best theoretical perspective for understanding these stone tools. A cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire can be used to study the operations or actions an object goes through from a raw state to a finished product (Bleed 2001; Lemonnier 1992, 1993). The Embarras Bipoint is a complex stone tool so the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire will be complex. Nevertheless, making a stone tool involves a series of repetitive operations; that is, during the course of manufacturing Embarras Bipoints there are actions, which are repeated more than once. In many ways the hermeneutics of replication and cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire take this complex sequence of actions and breaks it down into a smaller series or individual actions. Even though complex, the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of Embarras Bipoints is 6: Making and Understanding Embarr as Bipoints \u0018\u0018 Figure 6.2. An example of a hypothetical cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. consistent and, more importantly, transferable from bipoint to bipoint, suggesting that the reduction sequence was a controlled, learned behaviour, allowing us to explore such concepts as agency and/or other aspects of life during the Early Middle Period. I will now briefly outline the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of an Embarras Bipoint. To facilitate this discussion I have provided a generalized cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire, and the following discussion will be in direct reference to the process as seen in Figure 6.2. The first step in producing an object is to acquire the appropriate raw material. In this case, the acquisition of raw material does not include the cognitive, social, or political variables influencing the decision to quarry, access to the material, travel considerations, or intended purpose. Especially in the case of Embarras Bipoints, these aspects of agency are outside the realm of understanding for any operational sequence unless there are physical manifestations that could be linked to the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. In other words, raw material, in this case quartzite, cannot be considered part of a cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire until the material has been physically, chemically, or otherwise modified in some fashion by an individual. \u0018\u0018 Jason Roe For simplicity\u2019s sake, the term \u2018cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire\u2019 is used for the entire sequence of actions relating to the Embarras Bipoints. Depending on the goal(s) of the analyst, this stage of the formula can be scaled to either a micro or macro level. The cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire can be the entire operational sequence of an Embarras Bipoint from a raw state all the way to a discarded state, including the tools used, intended purpose, and so forth. Or, the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire can be a segment of a chain such as the shaping of one end on an Embarras Bipoint. And lastly, the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire can be the investigation of a single action such as the splitting of a cobble using bipolar percussion. Because of the potential range in scale(s), the formula requires fluidity and the generalized term cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire works for this purpose. An important guideline and the most obvious aspect of studying an operational sequence in its entirety, as a segment, or as a single action is that all of the properties have to be observable. The actions must be observable as either quantitative or qualitative features. This means the more inference one uses to make interpretations of data, the greater the chances the inference will not be valid. However, I do believe the more comfort or better understanding one has of the materials involved, the greater potential to use inference. But for the present study, each element of an action or set of actions will be treated as significant, be it empirical or subjective, as long as the features are observable. My early stage replicative studies will serve as an example to better illustrate the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. The objective was to split quartzite cobbles in an attempt to produce suitable spalls that could be worked into an Embarras Bipoint. A number of different knapping techniques were used to determine which worked well on quartzite and which did not. The projected goal of the early stage experiments was to produce spalls that had minimal flaws, were large enough to be reduced to a finished form, and had an appropriate plano-convex or bi-convex transverse cross-section. Of the different techniques used, bipolar percussion produced the most consistent results. For many of the cobbles tested, the desired outcome could be accomplished in as few as one action. However, because quartzite is a challenging toolstone to work an average of five actions were required to produce a result. Initially, my cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire included the concept of a mental template. A mental template can be defined as \u201cconscious ideas and ideals of the artifact makers, so that their identification is equivalent to recognition of cognitive or emic types which are those that would be distinguished by the artisan\u201d (White 6: Making and Understanding Embarr as Bipoints \u0018\u0018 et. al. 1977:380). A more in-depth discussion of the idea and definition of a mental template can be found in Peter J. White and others\u2019 1977 paper, Group Definitions and Mental Templates: An Ethnographic Experiment. After some consideration, a more appropriate idea of the mental template is as a \u201cflexible, mental conception\u201d (Hassan 1988:287). Whereas the concept of a mental template is fairly rigid, the mental conception is more flexible or a more fluid concept of a prototype or design. There are a number of elements that influence the flexible mental conception. I have adopted Lemonnier\u2019s (1986:152) four elements of an action. These elements can be further divided into those that can be cognitively manipulated (conscious) and those of which we may not be aware (unconscious). Again drawing from the early stage experimentation, one can visualize a quartzite cobble (raw material), an anvil and hammerstone (tools used), bipolar percussion (action), and my skills (specific knowledge). These are all physical manifestations or conscious decisions that can be used to make inferences about the unconscious or learned behaviour of the resultant action. The question that could then be asked is how was this conscious action influenced by previous actions and how will this action influence future actions? These questions involving conscious and unconscious elements of an action fit nicely with the flexible mental conception. This approach recognizes that the maker has a cognitive prototype of the finished product but also has the flexibility to alter and change strategies throughout the manufacturing process or cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. Understanding or being able to visualize the elements that influence the flexible mental conception provides a glimpse into the thought process behind making Embarras Bipoints. For example, quartzite, as a challenging toolstone, requires an average of five attempts to split a cobble by bipolar percussion using a sizable anvil and hammerstone. This type of physical action then becomes a learned behaviour that influences similar actions (i.e., splitting more cobbles) or determines the next best action (i.e., secondary and tertiary reduction) to produce a finished piece. Further, the use-life of a piece is linked to both the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire and the mental conception, as the process of making an object is wholly influenced by its intended purpose. In other words, the object would not be manufactured unless there was a purpose. Thus the operational sequence of making an Embarras Bipoint is directly tied to the intended use and later use-life of the object. For some people, the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire terminates at the point when the object is discarded, lost, or otherwise enters into the archaeological record. I \u0018\u0018 Jason Roe would argue that the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire continues until the item is collected and analyzed by the archaeologist. For this reason, the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire depicted in Figure 6.2, is directly linked to the taphonomic stage. The manufacturing residue from the production of an Embarras Bipoint can be discarded, thus entering the archaeological record directly, or the debitage can be used for some other purpose, in which case it re-enters into the material culture process. As mentioned earlier, some may consider the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of an object complete when the object enters the archaeological record. I include taphonomy because, even though the culturally intended purpose of an object has ended, there may be natural transforms which obliterate, smear, or otherwise affect the object. In other words, even the natural transforms are part of an ongoing life history of the artefact. The study of the various taphonomic forces that affect Embarras Bipoints between the time of their discard and eventual discovery by archaeologists would be a fascinating topic of study but will have to be left for future consideration. The last stage in Figure 6.2 represents what we as archaeologists do with an artefact once it has been recovered from the archaeological record. Our biases will influence our interpretations of the object and, by extension, our reconstruction of the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. A prime example of such archaeological biases would be the style versus function debate of the 1980s (see Sackett 1977, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1990; Wiessner 1983, 1984, 1985, 1989; Wobst 1977). As noted by Christopher Tilley (1989), absolute and complete objectivity is unattainable, but we still need to be aware of the various influences and biases that may affect our interpretations and make appropriate accommodations. Thus far, I have only briefly discussed some of the results of my ongoing research with Embarras Bipoints. Some avenues of future exploration include the possible identification of Embarras Bipoint sub-types, a more in-depth analysis of the dorsal to ventral flaking ratio and its potential, and more tertiary stage replicative studies. I will also analyze and interpret the patterning in the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire, seeking out and explaining any anomalies in the making of Embarras Bipoints, such as the reasons for and effects of flakes with edge bite striking platforms on the overall reduction sequence. Finally, I will explore the idea that Embarras Bipoints were manufactured following the simple principle of maximum results using the minimum amount of effort. 6: Making and Understanding Embarr as Bipoints \u0018\u0018 Conclusion In this paper I hoped to demonstrate that by studying the technological behaviour in the manufacturing process of Embarras Bipoints, there is the potential to better understand the stone tool practices of the people living during the Early Middle Period. To this end, I introduced Embarras Bipoints, provided some cursory data to elucidate the diagnostic potential of the Embarras Bipoint by looking at some of its more unique morphological attributes, and provided two analytical approaches that will best work to study them. This paper stems from the more in-depth work I am doing with Embarras Bipoints from a number of archaeological sites in and around the Eastern Slopes of Alberta.

Shott Abstract. Like people, stone tools age. Like people, their attributes change with and pattern. Reduction possesses systematic properties. Yet analytical treatment, when attempted, is anecdotal. This isn\u2019t good enough. Reduction alters the size and form of tools. It is a continuous process whose treatment requires continuous age. Many tools age by reduction during use, which varies by context in degree methods. Each tool is reduced to some particular degree, sets of tools to varying degrees expressed as reduction distributions. I fit distributions of Palaeoindian els like Weibull and Gompertz-Makeham, not to demonstrate (dubious) virtuosity, tion analysis is not a new tool, just the thoughtful use of simple measurements and mathematical models to make better sense of how the record formed. points, New Guinea flake tools, and experimental scrapers to mathematical modbut for efficient description and to identify causes like chance and attrition. Reduc- \u0018\u0018 There are only so many ways to design a wrench. Form, after all, often follows function. Owing to their nature or circumstances of use, tools like wrenches change little in size and form during use. Such empirical generalizations imply that the size and form of tools are related to their intended use and that their condition at discovery is determined by intended original use, not history or extent of use. No matter how true these generalizations often are, they are demonstrably untrue of stone tools, perhaps the most abundant and therefore informative archaeological material. No one ever doubted that stone tools were reduced as they were fashioned, but until recently few archaeologists assimilated the corollary that many stone tools continued to be reduced during use, systematically changing their original size and form. Tools change, as a function of time and use. Types as Essences, Types as Populations Traditional archaeological views of tool types resemble essential, not material, concepts of biological species. Into the Enlightenment, natural scientists imagined \u201cwell-defined species, presumably (since the Platonic dualism of realms of being was also still influential) corresponding to the distinctness of the Eternal Ideas\u201d (Lovejoy 1936:227). This is a fancy way of saying that biologists considered species to be fixed, unchanging essences. Internally, species exhibited only trivial variation. Externally, the divisions between species were clear differences of kind. Applied to lithic analysis, this view has two corollaries. First, tool types as Platonic essences possess integrity as joint morphological and functional kinds. Accordingly, there is no continuity, metrically or otherwise, between Middle Palaeolithic single, double and convergent scrapers, Australian steepedge scrapers and flat scrapers, or North American Pickwick and Elora points. Second, the size and form in which archaeologists find tools are the size and form in which they were used (excepting fracture and other distortions). Species are fundamental biological units of higher-order evolutionary theory. In the living world, species are defined in part by reproductive boundaries. Palaeobiologists cannot observe reproduction, so rely mostly upon anatomical differences to distinguish fossil species. Unable to observe living organisms, palaeobiologists must order fossil specimens into units like species but must not \u0018\u0018 Michael j. Shott confuse taxonomy with other sources of variation (e.g., polymorphism, growth from birth to maturity). To pursue the palaeobiological analogy, archaeologists define types from the great variation expressed in stone tools. But they cannot observe in use the tools that they classify and know that some stone tools were only parts of larger wholes, not integral wholes themselves. Like palaeontologists, archaeologists must accommodate systematic variation that occurs within, not between, taxa. Reduction is an archaeological analogue of biological growth that works in the opposite direction. Reduction itself occurs flake by flake. Nominally, it is discrete but it is better understood as a continuous process, both because the incremental units \u2013 retouch flakes \u2013 ordinarily are very small relative to the tool and because reduction is measured by continuous variables or dimensions like length and width. If reduction is continuous, then tools vary in continuous terms (Hiscock and Attenbrow 2003), so cannot approximate Platonic essences. Any types formed among the complex variation in stone-tool size and form are empirical tendencies; they are populations, not essential types. This is not to deny the validity of typological concepts nor the reality of many stone-tool types. Even empirical tendencies sometimes are discretely different from one another. It is, however, to deny the necessity of essential types and to acknowledge that much variation in stone-tool size and form owes to continuous reduction combined with modes of use and retouch. This is the reduction thesis, which had independent Old World and New World origins and far-reaching implications for ontological fundamentals like the nature and identity of types and how tool assemblages form. In biology, species possess at least a measure of integrity; lions never become giraffes. But in evolutionary time, species evolve into descendants by various modes, so typological integrity is breached over long spans or at higher taxonomic levels than species. In different ways, lithic reduction compromises the integrity of tool types. Lions never become giraffes but Oldowan cobbles become discoids become scrapers (Sahnouni et al. 1997) and Pickwick points become Eloras (Hoffman 1985:580). Reduction and its effects on tool size and form \u2013 and therefore on typology \u2013 register clearly in Palaeolithic tools (Dibble 1987), North American stemmed bifaces (Hoffman 1985) and Palaeoindian hidescrapers (Shott 1995), Australian flake tools (Hiscock and Attenbrow 2003), and in Ethiopian hidescrapers 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u0018\u0018 (Shott and Weedman 2007; Weedman 2002). Reduction effects are recognized in many tool types of many ages from many parts of the world. Types defined in these reduction trajectories lack integrity (but may retain descriptive validity); defining types among these tools is like slicing a piece of water from a flowing stream. Reduction and Cur ation Besides its typological implications, reduction engages the theoretical question of curation. This quantity is the relationship between realized and maximum utility of tools, i.e., how used up tools become (Shott 1996). So defined, curation itself engages the further concept of utility. \u201cUtility\u201d has several meanings (e.g., Shott 1996:269\u2013271); for practical purposes, it signifies the amount of use that a tool can supply. Practically, maximum utility is approximated as the greatest amount or degree of reduction that a tool can undergo, realized utility as the reduction (less than or equal to maximum utility) that it actually experiences. Size and form at discard gives the latter quantity. Nothing directly gives the former, but it is approximated by original mass, size, or volume. However utility is defined, therefore, its estimation requires knowing original size of specimens. Curation is not use life, which is simply the longevity of tools in time, number of uses or other units; specimens in a type can be highly curated even if the type\u2019s mean use life is short or, conversely, curated at low rates even though the type\u2019s mean use life is high (Shott and Sillitoe 2005). Like use life or, for that matter, height or weight, curation can be measured by central tendency (e.g., mean, median) (Schiffer 1976:54). Unless all specimens had identical histories, however, the distribution of curation values is as important as central tendency (Shott and Sillitoe 2004), just as the distribution of height is as important as its mean in any population. Two artefact categories can be equal in mean curation but very different in their distributions, one showing little variation around the mean, the other a great deal. Consider an analogy to pencils. Two sets of discarded pencils both average, say, 50 per cent reduction of original length. In one, all pencils are reduced to that figure. In the other, pencils are discarded in equal proportions from slight reduction of 1 per cent to practically complete reduction to stubs at 99 per cent. In this deliberately \u0018\u0018 Michael j. Shott exaggerated example, identity in mean disguises great variation in distribution that demands explanation. At the assemblage level, degree or amount of curation is distributed across specimens to form curation distributions or curves. Curation distributions may seem esoteric but influence how the archaeological record formed (Shott and Sillitoe 2005), and so they are important to know. They remain practically unknown in lithic analysis, yet precedents elsewhere attest to their value. Faunal analysts and palaeodemographers routinely estimate age-at-death in their subjects. No faunal analysis is complete before determining death-age curves, whose form and scale distinguish hunting from attritional causes. No osteological analysis is complete before determining age-specific mortality because mortality distributions implicate diet, social complexity, density-dependent disease incidence or other cultural factors. In short, faunal analysis and palaeodemography are incomplete without regard for the scale and form of mortality distributions. Lithic analysis is incomplete without regard for curation distributions. Curation curves can be compared between assemblages, but they also can be analyzed. Depending on their forms and the distribution of values that comprise them, curves fitted to the Weibull and other theoretical models may implicate the effects of chance versus attrition in tool failure. For instance, North American Palaeoindian fluted bifaces and endscrapers had different characteristic cumulative-survivorship curves and failure distributions (Shott and Sillitoe 2004:350\u2013352). Biface discard was governed by chance, which is no surprise considering that bifaces (\u201cpoints\u201d) are thin for their size and are subjected to myriad physical stresses from striking objects at high speeds. Endscraper discard was governed by attrition, again no surprise considering that scrapers are thicker and more robust for their size and in use are subjected to fewer and less variable stresses. Measuring Reduction As important as it is for typology and curation analysis, reduction has proven difficult to measure. Until accurate and precise indices were devised, tool reduction could only be approximated qualitatively. For instance, Dibble\u2019s (1987) Middle Palaeolithic reduction thesis equated reduction stage with typological 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u0018\u0018 status (i.e., if a flake tool was reduced so much, it became a Type A tool, if so much more a Type B tool, and so on). Essentially, reduction approximated this way is a nominal variable, a necessary status in the absence of reduction measures. But only reduction indices grounded in estimates of tools\u2019 original size can measure reduction and curation as ratio-scale, continuous variables. This point is much more than academic because continuous measurement of reduction is faithful to the continuous nature of the reduction process (e.g., Larson and Finley 2004). Ratio-scale reduction can be analyzed in ways that nominal- or ordinal-scale reduction cannot be. So measuring reduction requires comparing the end result \u2013 the tool as discarded to enter the archaeological record and thus found by archaeologists \u2013 to its original size and form. Archaeologists have devised and tested several reduction measures based on form, geometry, retouch characteristics, the allometry of original size and form, and archaeological context (e.g., Andrefsky 2006; Andrefsky 2008; Clarkson 2002; Hiscock and Attenbrow 2003; Shott and Ballenger 2007; Shott and Weedman 2007). All are useful, but their value might vary by tool type, industry, toolstone, context, or other factors. All are inherently limited, but in different respects; no biface-reduction measure, for instance, can be grounded in the cross-section geometry of flakes or in platform allometry because bifaces lack these features. Even some flake tools like endscrapers are modified extensively before use by trimming or removing features like their platforms. But several indices can be measured on the same specimens, so there are opportunities to compare them. Comparisons will be complicated because measures do not scale identically. A geometric index commonly applied to Australian flake tools (Hiscock and Attenbrow 2003), for instance, is a ratio that varies between 0 and 1 and measures reduction in two-dimensional cross-section form of three-dimensional objects. Clarkson\u2019s (2002) invasiveness index varies over the same range but measures reduction by the sum of interval scores of retouch extent. Flake allometry measures (Shott and Ballenger 2007) also are ratios, often between two-dimensional measures (platform area and surface area). Depending on the allometric measure, values can range from 0 to well above 1. No matter their differences in scale, reduction measures must be compared in controlled experiments and empirical data. But reduction is best measured using all means available, and no single estimator is likely to be best for all purposes or in all tool types. Several estimators are apt to correlate differently with \u0018\u0018 Michael j. Shott one another. Measures\u2019 suitability for particular tool types and purposes are matters for further research. My purpose here is merely to demonstrate the use and implications of several simple reduction measures applied to Midwestern North American Palaeoindian tool types. Reduction and Model-Fitting Shott and Sillitoe\u2019s (2004) earlier analysis involved small samples of Midwestern North American Palaeoindian tools. Here, I use much larger samples, especially of bifaces, and expand analysis by fitting reduction distributions to the Weibull and Gompertz-Makeham two-parameter models. Weibull \u03b1 is a scale (i.e., use life) parameter, \u03b2 a shape parameter that implicates different causes of failure or discard (Shott and Sillitoe 2004). If \u03b2 = 1, failure is by chance; if \u03b2 > 1, failure is by attrition. Significant departure from 1 was gauged by maximum likelihood estimation (Shott and Sillitoe 2004:344). Gompertz-Makeham a also is a scale parameter, b a shape parameter that measures failure rate as a function of time. Gompertz-Makeham b can be interpreted as curation rate, higher values indicating greater curation (Shott and Sillitoe 2005). Weibull and GompertzMakeham parameters do not scale identically; the same data can yield different estimates for parameters of the two models. I compare bifaces and unifaces from occupational sites from two successive Palaeoindian phases, Gainey (ca. 11,500\u201310,900 RCYBP) and Parkhill (ca. 10,900\u201310,500 RCYBP). Shott (2004) described the phases and samples. I studied about 380 Clovis-Gainey bifaces and about 80 Barnes bifaces of Parkhill affinity from assemblages in the American Midwest. Endscrapers are common in Midwestern Palaeoindian assemblages, but data on metric dimensions suitable for estimating reduction are not. I used all available sources: two Gainey-affinity and two Parkhill-affinity assemblages from the Great Lakes. Biface Reduction. A tool\u2019s size at discard is a simple matter of measurement. But knowing how much it was reduced in use requires knowing original size. For fluted bifaces, I estimated original size from dimensions of Gainey and Barnes specimens found in Midwestern or nearby caches. Cache bifaces were longer than analyzed specimens found at occupational sites, but not consistently longer in other dimensions of blade or haft. Accordingly, I estimated reduction as the ratio of each specimen\u2019s length to the mean length of cache bifaces; the 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u0018\u0018 Figure 7.1. Cumulative Survivorship in Gainey and Barnes Bifaces. resulting index varies between 0 and 1. Then I subtracted the result from 1 so that more reduced specimens have higher values. Figure 7.1 shows each type\u2019s cumulative survivorship curve with the abscissa rescaled, for reasons discussed by Shott and Sillitoe (2004, 2005), to relative reduction, accomplished by dividing each specimen\u2019s reduction value by the mean for its type. Gompertz-Makeham estimates differ little between the types (Table 7.1) and confidence ranges overlap greatly. Gainey and Barnes bifaces differ little in model parameters. \u0018\u0018 Michael j.

These tools wore out; they did not fail by accident. This result may surprise, both because fluted bifaces commonly are thought to have been lost in use and therefore scattered across the landscape as what many archaeologists call \u201cisolated finds,\u201d and because attrition suggests use as knives or general-purpose tools at least as much as weapon tips. Reduction or curation analysis is valuable for what it suggests about tool use and the formation of tool assemblages. In experimental points used as darts, failure typically is by chance (Shott 2002). Not so in Midwestern Palaeoindian bifaces, at least in the reduction measures used here. Endscraper Reduction. Lacking caches of unreduced unifaces, original size must be estimated differently. In actualistic experiments, flake surface area (length * width) was expressed as a function of platform area (Shott et al. 2000: Table 4). I call this RED1, as follows: RED1 = Area / 4.36 + .52 * (platform width*platform thickness). RED1 estimates original size as flake area. In controlled experiments, Pelcin (1996:Table 11) expressed flake weight as a function of platform thickness. I call this size estimate RED2, as follows: RED2 = Observed Weight / (.011 * platform thickness)3 \u2013 (.63*platform thickness)2 + (2.819 * platform thickness). This expression estimates amount of weight reduction experienced by a tool. There are other uniface-reduction measures (e.g., Clarkson 2002; Hiscock and 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u0018\u0018 A. B. Figure 7.2. Cumulative Survivorship in Gainey and Parkhill Unifaces: A. Using RED1. B. Using RED2. \u001800 Michael j. Shott Table 7.2.

As with bifaces, I converted measures such that higher values signify greater reduction. Strictly, the \u201cBarnes\u201d type pertains only to bifaces, which are diagnostic of the Parkhill Phase. For consistency only, I refer to Parkhill Phase unifaces as \u201cBarnes.\u201d Gainey and Barnes endscrapers differ in mean of RED1, based on linear dimensions, but not of RED2, based on weight. In both cases, Gainey Phase specimens have higher values and therefore are more extensively reduced. Using RED1, there is considerably lower survivorship in Barnes specimens (Figure 7.2a). Accordingly, the Barnes \u03b2 is lower, indicating chance, Gainey \u03b2 higher, indicating attrition (Table 7.2). Gompertz-Makeham b values also differ. In RED2, distributions are more similar (Figure 7.2b); despite Gainey\u2019s higher value neither \u03b2 significantly exceeds 1. (Figure 7.2a,b uses absolute, not relative, reduction [\u201cage\u201d] to emphasize differences between distributions.) Gompertz-Makeham b values are nearly identical. Measures differ in results. On balance, however, Gainey endscrapers are somewhat more reduced and therefore better curated. Whatever reduction or curation measures imply about tool use, they more directly suggest how assemblages formed. Attrited tools do not fail at unpredictable times and places. Therefore, attrited tools should accumulate at places in 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u00180\u0018 numbers sufficient for their assemblages to be identified as large \u201csites.\u201d Attrited tools have more predictable life histories and longevity. Their size and composition in assemblages register the joint effects of rate of activity performance and difference in use life. Therefore, their assemblages should show correlation between size and composition. Tools that fail by chance do so without regard to time or place, so they might be more dispersed across the landscape. They should accumulate in more but smaller assemblages and at rates independent of activity performance. Conclusion The above are mere examples of reduction analysis and fitting distributions to mathematical models. As research continues, we must consider challenges and problems. There always is the empirical problem of more data, which bears no more than passing mention here. More significant are methodological problems. We must learn more about the consistency of different reduction measures and the distributions that result from them. If the same tools yield significantly different distributions using different reduction measures, then we must determine the most valid measures. There is also the question of measurement scale of input data. Weibull arose in industrial settings. There it often is applied to very small data sets in which each tested specimen\u2019s time-to-failure can be input. But stone-tool assemblages, like human and other populations, often are large enough that input data on reduction must be pooled. The number and width of intervals chosen may influence results, especially in fitting to GompertzMakeham. Again, we need more study of possible effects before this approach to reduction analysis becomes standardized. Besides the validity of measures, we must consider additional mathematical models. Weibull is common in engineering, Gompertz-Makeham in human demography. But general models like the exponential, and more complex models also should be considered. The steep decline in Barnes scraper survivorship at low \u201cage\u201d (Figure 7.2a,b), for instance, resembles high infant mortality, which might fit Siler\u2019s (1979) model. Demographic models were designed for common patterns of mortality in human and animal populations. Animals and stone tools do not survive for \u00180\u0018 Michael j. Shott the same lengths of time, so of course their mortality or curation distributions differ in scale. Scale parameters control for such differences. (Various reduction measures also may differ in range and scale; presumably, scale parameters can measure and thereby control for this variation.) More significant are differences in the shape or form of distributions. Demographic models assume low mortality either from birth or inception or after an initial period of relatively high risk, until late stages of life. Accordingly, a typical hazard distribution for humans and other animals is roughly U-shaped. There is no reason to assume that the distribution of risk of failure is similar in stone tools or other archaeological objects. Other models may be more suitable. Besides its obvious implications for lithic typology and curation, the reduction thesis has a deceptively profound implication for the meaning to attach to tool assemblages. The traditional archaeological view identifies tool size and form with templates and thereby constructs types. It associates types with activities, whether broad (\u201cscraper\u201d) or narrow (\u201cdry-hide scraper\u201d). Traditional premises are that variation in tool size and form is essential (i.e., forming sets of discrete formal types) and that types bear some relationship to activity or function. The view accepts a measure of uncertainty; some types are more distinct, have more formal integrity than others, and some types might be more multifunctional than others. Substantially, though, premises are qualitative. Traditional lithic classification identifies kinds of activities or uses. The presence of a cleaver in an assemblage indicates butchering, the presence of a scraper scraping. The reduction thesis has different premises. It views variation in tool size and form as continuous, i.e., forming complex patterns of variable association and distribution but not discrete, essential types. It does not so much reject as moot the traditional view\u2019s form-function identities. However tools were used, much of their size-form variation owes to amount of use and pattern of retouch. The reduction thesis has more quantitative than qualitative, premises. In its view, the presence in an assemblage of, say, a tula slug is not evidence of a kind of activity, unless that activity is defined broadly as scraping-planing-cutting. Instead, its presence registers an amount of reduction that attended some kind and amount of tool use. That is, a type\u2019s presence in an assemblage no longer means \u201cKind of Tool or Activity X\u201d but instead \u201cAmount of Reduction Y.\u201d The reduction thesis has profound implications for how assemblages form and what they mean. Methodological challenges remain before reduction analysis becomes a standard tool of the trade in lithic analysis. But there is no 7: Systematic Properties of Stone Tool Reduction \u00180\u0018 reason to ignore the challenges or the potential that reduction analysis holds to broaden the scope of cultural inference from sparse archaeological remains.

This paper is a report of preliminary petrographic analysis of ceramic duras. The analysis involved three stages: 1) preliminary petrographic examination of sherds as a means of adding microscopic data to the current type-variety-mode manufacture and production; 2) comparison of identified petrofabrics with clay samples from the site of Rancho del Rio, Valle de Cacaulapa, Northwestern Hon- typology used in the valley in order to investigate the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of ceramic \u2018globules\u2019 found on potsherds from the site; and 3) an attempt to located the actual source and/or environment of the clays used in pre-Columbian vessel manufacture. Five petrofabrics were identified in total and petrographically matched to some of the potstands studied. \u00180\u0018 Introduction The macroscopic analysis of pottery as a means of understanding social concepts, political and economic \u2018boundaries,\u2019 and daily activities is a common aspect of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican studies. However, research questions addressing how and where pottery was manufactured seem less prevalent. Key reasons for ignoring these questions include: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 poor preservation of features; an inability to efficiently recognize manufacture locations and remains; the absence of questions posed regarding the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of ceramic manufacture; the focus of excavations on major site epicentres and civic-ceremonial structures and less concentration on lower strata residential areas and large open areas (such as courtyards) where much activity was likely to have occurred; the belief that archaeological typologies based on macroscopic characteristics can supply significant and abundant information regarding the finished vessels (Wardle 1992:11); the lack of communication among material analysts, archaeologists, ethnoarchaeologists, and anthropologists as to the value of inquiries based in archaeometry and geology. \u2022 \u2022 According to Arnold (1991), there are three classes of data that can potentially serve to identify ceramic manufacture locations in the archaeological record: 1) tools and facilities, 2) mistakes, production residues, etc., and 3) finished products (Arnold 1991:87; see Rice 1996 for similar classes). This third class can provide important information concerning patterns of distribution, characteristics of consumer population, and, most importantly, information on the physical manufacture of the items. Any analysis of these three stages can provide important data towards the reconstruction of the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of ceramic manufacture: the \u201cseries of operations which brings a primary material \u00180\u0018 Meaghan M. Peur amaki-Brown [clay] from its natural state to a fabricated state [final vessel]\u201d (Cresswell 1976:6; brackets are author\u2019s examples). Understanding such operations and choices allows archaeologists a closer view of individual agency and shared ideas within given social groups of the prehistoric past (Lemonnier 1992). Thin Section Petrogr aphy: Use in Archaeological Investigation In order to study the manufacturing process of ceramic vessels it is necessary to employ techniques that provide greater insight into the physical materials than is provided by traditional macroscopic type-variety systems. Thin section petrographic analysis is a geological technique used to systematically describe, classify, and identify minerals and rocks (Barclay 2001:9; Bishop et al. 1982:285; Gribble and Hall 1992:6; Rice 1987:376; Rye 1981:51\u201352; Shepard 1965:139; Tite 1999:195; Vince 2003). When dealing with ceramics, petrographic analysis may also lead to the identification of intentionally added materials (temper) (Barclay 2001:10); thus, shedding light on such issues as potting choices, raw material access, paste recipes, etc. The recognition of such characteristics as sorting, shape, roundness and sphericity, and particle density, in addition to mineral types, can also aid in geographically or geologically locating raw material sources or manufacturing centres. Archaeological Setting: The Valle de Cacaulapa and R ancho del Rio During the summer of 2004, I was invited to join archaeological excavations at the pre-Columbian site of Rancho del Rio, located in the Valley of Cacaulapa in the Santa Barbara District of Northwestern Honduras (Figure 8.1). My work with excavations and the ceramics from the site strived to create a preliminary base from which the Rancho del Rio investigations into the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of ceramic manufacture and resultant questions concerning production could be launched (Peuramaki-Brown 2004). The Valley of Cacaulapa, in which Rancho del Rio is situated, is a narrow valley of the Rio Chamelec\u00f3n and its tributary, the Rio Cacaulapa. The river 8: The Cha\u00cene op\u00c9r atoire of Cer amic Manufacture \u00180\u0018 \u0018\u00180 Meaghan M. Peur amaki-Brown Figure 8.1. Map of Northwestern Honduras with location of Rancho del Rio (Redrawn from Small and Shugar 2004). originates in the igneous and metamorphic highlands to the south and carries water year-round. The valley is situated at the nexus of three geological zones: the Atima limestone formation (southeast of the valley), igneous rock intrusions and flows (to the south), and an area of sand- and siltstone. This unique position provided numerous resources for the pre-Columbian populations of the valley. The largest site in the valley, El Coyote, in the lower part of the valley, covers approximately 6 km\u00b2 and encompasses a minimum of 360 platform structures. The strongest period of valley occupation occurs during the Late Classic (650\u2013900 C.E.) and Early Postclassic (900\u20131100 C.E.) periods (Small and Shugar 2004). Excavations at the site of Rancho del Rio centre on understanding rural economies, especially the production and exchange of rural produced goods. During a 1997 survey, Rancho del Rio was identified and recognized as comprising eight structures. Previous and ongoing excavations were aimed at determining the extent of site occupation (geographically and temporally) and opening the inner courtyard and revealing its relationship to the structures (Small and Peuramaki-Brown 2004). To date, excavations have suggested that the ancient inhabitants of Rancho del Rio were possibly engaged in pottery production. Large middens consisting primarily of ceramic debris were encountered during courtyard testing and excavations (Small and Peuramaki-Brown 2004; Small and Shugar 2004). These included possible ceramic tools: broken sherds used as scrapers, shapers, and smoothers to make pottery, similar to those found at the site of K\u2019axob in Northern Belize (Varela et al. 2001:186\u2013187), vitrified ceramic (occasionally labelled as ceramic \u2018slag\u2019), pieces of clay \u2018waste,\u2019 crushing implements (manos and metates), countless broken sherds of the four paste groups examined in this research, possible temper blocks of a low-grade schist, which I will discuss later, and \u2018potstands\u2019: modified jar rims used to support vessels during manufacture (Figure 8.2). The potstands hold tell-tale signs of pottery manufacture, consisting of large pieces of wet clay that fell off the wet pots as they were being shaped and dried onto these stands and, in some instances, were eventually baked or fired with the pot (how or why this was done is not known). Similar potstands have been recovered at the nearby site of Las Canoas and elsewhere in the valley (Stockett 2005:388). These stands can provide a potential direct link in the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire, from the raw material through the forming technology to the finished object, since they supply a possible identifiable local fabric. 8: The Cha\u00cene op\u00c9r atoire of Cer amic Manufacture \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 8.2. Example of a ceramic potstand with an arrow indicating the clay \u2018globules\u2019 on the exterior surface (Photograph by Dr. David Small 2003). Stages and Purpose of Petrogr aphic Analysis The following analysis addresses the question of pottery manufacture at Rancho del Rio during the late facet of the Late Classic Period (for complete analysis results and interpretations, see Peuramaki-Brown 2004). Petrographic analysis was chosen above other analytical techniques due to the large number of inclusions found in ceramics from the site. The analysis is composed of three stages: Stage 1 consisted of the preliminary identification and description of the various petrofabrics observed from twenty ceramic sherd samples. These consisted of five jar rim sherds from each of the four most abundant macrovisual paste groups found at Rancho del Rio (Cacaulapa, San Joaquin, Pueblo Nuevo, and Pitones) and their relationship to the established macrovisual type-varietymode system employed in the Valley of Cacaulapa. This will provide a pedestal for the further study of ceramic manufacture at the site. This stage comprises Arnold\u2019s (1991) previously mentioned third class of data. Stage 2 consisted of the petrographic analysis of clay \u2018globules\u2019 on potstands from Rancho del Rio. Thin sections were made of five identified potstand sherds with globules representing two macrovisually different types of residues in an \u0018\u0018\u0018 Meaghan M. Peur amaki-Brown attempt to match this manufacturing waste to the identified petrofabrics. This accounts for Arnold\u2019s (1991) first and second classes of data. Stage 3 consisted of the identification of the environment and/or source from which the clay and possible tempers used in pottery manufacture at Rancho del Rio were obtained. Three clay sources were tested through briquette manufacture and firing, along with the addition of crushed schist from courtyard excavations to a fourth briquette. This, along with the final product, satisfies Arnold\u2019s (1991) third class of data. Results and Discussion of Petrogr aphic Analysis Petrofabrics. From the four type-variety paste groups represented in the Rancho del Rio ceramic sample, five petrofabric groups were identified: Volcanic Ash 1, Volcanic Ash 2, Volcanic Ash 3, Muscovite 1, and Muscovite 2 (Table 8.1; Table 8.2; Figure 8.3). The clay bodies appear very similar in aplastic content, including volcanic ash and many fine particles of muscovite and polycrystalline quartz, and are likely derived from similar environments. The clay bodies are secondary and likely of metamorphic and igneous origin, indicated by metamorphic and igneous rock fragments within the clay body (natural inclusions), volcanic ash, and polycrystalline quartz (MacKenzie and Adams 1994:48,153\u2013155; MacKenzie and Guilford 1980:71). This would seem typical of the Chamelec\u00f3n River based on its origins. Although very similar in aplastic content, roughly representing a continuum, differences in ratios of aplastics, grain size, as well as shape, provide rationale for division of the petrographic groups. All contain a high percentage of volcanic ash, though only Volcanic Ash 1 appears to have ash that may have been added as a temper. The \u2018crisp\u2019 edges of the ash within the clay body, unlike the \u2018blended\u2019 ash borders seen in Volcanic Ash 2 and 3 and Muscovite 1 and 2, together with the great abundance of ash, lends credence to this premise (for similar observations, see Jones 1991:172). Volcanic ash is a desirable inclusion due to its low level of thermal expansion and irregular particle shapes allowing for stronger bonds with clay (Arnold 1991:23\u201324). Overall, Volcanic Ash 1 is extremely homogenous when compared with the other petrofabrics represented in the sample.

Volcanic Ash 2 and 3 are similar to Volcanic Ash 1 in their high content of volcanic ash and their relatively porous body; however, the ash in these petrofabrics is more similar to that of Muscovite 1 and 2. The borders of the ash are \u2018blended\u2019, making it appear that the ash is a natural part of the clay. They also possess a slightly higher percentage of inclusions (other than ash) when compared with Volcanic Ash 1, though less than the Muscovite petrofabrics. They are slightly coarser than Volcanic Ash 1 and the lighter tan colour of Volcanic Ash 2 as compared with Volcanic Ash 1 and 3 may be due to its higher content of muscovite and polycrystalline quartz. When fired, higher silica contents produce a cream to light brown colour (Fuente 2004:6). While the most abundant inclusion in Muscovite 1 and 2 is volcanic ash, they differ significantly from their Volcanic Ash counterparts in their very high content of muscovite mica, polycrystalline quartz, and micaceous schist. The presence, although small, of chlorite (likely part of the schist) also distinguishes these petrofabrics from the three Volcanic Ash groups. The abundance of these three inclusions, as well as their more angular and coarse nature when compared with the previous three petrofabrics, suggest their possible addition as 8: The Cha\u00cene op\u00c9r atoire of Cer amic Manufacture \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 8.3. Five identified petrofabrics, photographed in plane-polarized light at 10x magnification; (A) Volcanic Ash 1, (B) Volcanic Ash 2, (C) Volcanic Ash 3, (D) Muscovite 1, (E) Muscovite 2 (Photographed by Meaghan Peuramaki-Brown 2004). temper (Rye 1981:37). During excavations of the courtyard, lumps of easily flaked, low-grade metamorphic, micaceous schist were recovered in association with other ceramic debris. Schist is not seen in the architecture of the Valle de Cacaulapa, nor have known source outcrops been identified to date. The nearby valley of Naco does have schist sources, and pre-Columbian inhabitants there used varieties of the stone in the construction of their structures. As will be explained below, experimentation with the schist found at the site produced results similar to those observed in the Muscovite petrofabrics. The possibility of trade in schist between the two valleys is a subject that could be investigated in the future. Finally, the differences in ratios of muscovite, polycrystalline quartz, and micaceous schist between Muscovite 1 and Muscovite 2 may account for the colour differentiation between the two petrofabrics, as it does between Volcanic Ash 2 and Volcanic Ash 3. Potstands. When the potstand thin sections were examined (Figure 8.4), the material found coating Potstands 1, 2, and 3 did not resemble any of the petrofabrics represented in the Rancho del Rio ceramic thin sections. It is possible that this \u2018silt-like\u2019 material was the result of past flooding in the courtyard, resulting from a rise in water levels in the nearby Chamelec\u00f3n River. The high \u0018\u0018\u0018 Meaghan M. Peur amaki-Brown quantity of calcite in the silt could be related to the calcite observed in the clay sources analyzed from the valley. Potstands 4 and 5 are much more \u2018typical\u2019 of the appearance of potstands with globules observed at other sites in the valley. The matching of the globules with two of the petrofabrics (Volcanic Ash 2 and 3, respectively) represented in the Rancho del Rio ceramic material suggest that manufacture was indeed occurring at the site; however, it is important to remember that these are only preliminary studies and other potstands similar to these should be analyzed before any firm conclusions are drawn. Clay sources. Although none of the clay sources analyzed were an exact match to the ceramic petrofabrics, some similarities were observed. Muscovite, polycrystalline quartz, micaceous schist, plagioclase feldspar, basalt, and gypsum are all rocks and minerals found in both the Rancho del Rio petrofabrics and the three clay sources. The lack of ash within the sources, except for a small amount in Source B, could be due to the temporal distribution of volcanic ash deposits. The high content of calcite, possibly due to shell within the river sediments, may also be a temporal characteristic. Overall, the particular minerals and rocks found within the clay sources (metamorphic and igneous/volcanic), as well as their angularity, suggest a possible match in environmental sourcing. However, there can be no definite conclusion drawn as analyses of more source and sherd samples are required. Based on ethnographic studies of distances between clay sources and vessel manufacture locations (D. E. Arnold 1971, 1985), it is reasonable to still assume clays were collected near the site. When some of the easily-flaked muscovite schist (a low-grade metamorphic) that was recovered from courtyard excavations was crushed and added to a test briquette with Clay Source C, some interesting observations were made. The overall percentage of muscovite (common in schistose rock [Adams et al. 1984:14]), polycrystalline quartz, and micaceous schist increased. Also present after the addition of the temper was chlorite, which is found primarily within the identified schist fragments. Numerous observations imply the addition of this material as temper by Late Classic potters. First, the presence of this rock associated with pottery sherds, possible ceramic manufacturing tools, and manufacture residue within the late facet of the Late Classic courtyard suggest associate use patterns. The absence of known outcropping in the valley and the lack of use of this type of rock in Late Classic valley architecture suggests an anomalous use pattern for 8: The Cha\u00cene op\u00c9r atoire of Cer amic Manufacture \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 8.4.

Finally, the increased presence of muscovite, polycrystalline quartz, micaceous (muscovite) schist, and chlorite within two of the petrofabrics from the Rancho del Rio sample and the angular nature of these inclusions suggest addition of schist temper. Why schist was added, given that it has no known advantage in pottery manufacture, is uncertain. However, the additional \u2018sparkle\u2019 that the muscovite in the schist provides may have been a desired characteristic, exemplified by other high micaceous content paste groups from the valley such as Joya (Pat Urban and Edward Schortman, personal communication 2004). Finally, the addition of the schist to Clay Source C also created a postfiring colour change not observed in the briquette made only of Clay Source C. The addition of the schist caused a colour change from a yellow to a light brown, similar to that observed in Muscovite 1, Muscovite 2, and Volcanic Ash 2, all of which have more schist, muscovite, and polycrystalline quartz than the other petrofabrics. Concluding Remarks Research at the site of Rancho del Rio in the Valle de Cacaulapa, Northwest Honduras has the potential to uncover critical information concerning the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of ceramic manufacture in this corner of Mesoamerica. Preliminary analysis of the \u2018final product\u2019 of manufacture is the most logical starting point \u0018\u00180 Meaghan M. Peur amaki-Brown and the results encourage future investigation into ceramic manufacture and production at the site of Rancho del Rio. Further questions resulting from the present analysis may address issues such as inter-valley trade of raw materials (i.e., schist) used in pottery manufacture and degree of production as represented by the relationship between vessel form and petrofabric, along with the standardization of tool and potstand forms. The petrographic comparison of the Rancho del Rio fabrics and clay sources with those of other sites within the valley and beyond would also shed light on regional ceramic manufacture practices. The results would greatly contribute to our understanding of inter- and intra-valley relationships regarding ceramic manufacture and production in this region, and possibly within Mesoamerica in general.

Cecil Abstract. A review of current research concerning pottery analysis done by anthropologically oriented archaeologists elucidates the almost exclusive reliance on archaeometric techniques (e.g., INAA and ICPS) for attempting to understand human behaviour. Because of the notoriety and value of archaeometric techniques technical kinds of analyses (colour and form measurements and petrography), fore, by conjoining archaeometric and non-archaeometric techniques of analyses, not have been apparent using only archaeometry. I demonstrate the value of this for archaeological research, we are often drawn away from the more basic, nonthus missing opportunities to more fully understand the cultures we study. Therearchaeologists can better interpret the complexity of past human events that may type of research by presenting a case study of the Pet\u00e9n Postclassic Maya pottery manufacturing traditions (clay and pigment sources and decorative programs) and Spanish contact. changing trade patterns before and during the socio-politically complex milieu of \u0018\u0018\u0018 Introduction The analysis of a collection of pottery can be accomplished by a myriad of techniques that include, but are not limited to, classification (devised and folk), colour and form measurements, re-firing experiments, strength and hardness measurements, thin-section (petrographic), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), neutron activation analysis (INAA or NAA), and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICPS or some variation thereof). Each technique has its strengths and weakness and is appropriate for addressing different research questions. Analyzing pottery through a visual examination (e.g., decorative styles, estimations of firing temperatures and slip and paste colour measurements) provides qualitative information about technology (Orton et al. 1993; Rice 1987b). By beginning an analysis with these \u201clow-tech\u201d methods, the archaeologist gathers objective qualitative data to evaluate technological characteristics as well as the operational choices that may be embedded in pottery production. Alone, these data may not contribute \u201cearth-shattering\u201d results, but when conjoined with archaeometric techniques, the archaeologist has a much more powerful dataset from which to draw conclusions about behavioural choices as well as how an ancient culture may have seen its past, present, and future. To more fully understand human behaviours and choices during pottery manufacture, it is almost impossible not to include mineralogical and/or chemical methods of analysis. While many current projects, but by no means all, employ INAA and ICPS as the archaeometric standard for obtaining the chemical composition of pottery, petrographic thin-section analysis was the norm. Many petrographic analyses, in both past and current research, can distinguish between source materials, and the researchers are then able to determine trade patterns, reciprocity patterns, and \u201cmother cultures\u201d (Flannery et al. 2005). Petrography also allows for the study of pottery manufacturing processes such as slipping, painting, and forming methods (e.g., Dickinson et al. 2001; Middleton et al. 1985). By the 1980s, INAA became the standard for quantifying trace and rare earth elements in ceramic pastes. Because of its high precision and sensitivity and ability to discriminate pottery groups and clay sources, many archaeologists turned to this technique to answer questions previously addressed by petro\u0018\u0018\u0018 LESLIE G. CECIL graphic analysis (e.g., Adan-Bayewitz and Weider 1992; Blomster et al. 2005). As a result, INAA became the technique of choice. Some archaeologists would, and still do, submit samples to see what the chemistry \u201csays\u201d and then they formulate research questions to fit their data. Additionally, many projects that involve INAA do not use other techniques of analysis to provide additional, equally valuable data to their research projects. More recently, ICPS has been added to the list of successful techniques for determining the chemical composition of ceramic pastes and slips (e.g., Neff 2003; Speakman 2005). Because many researchers use solely archaeometric techniques for the analysis of their data set, antagonism has developed among archaeologists (e.g., Blomster et al. 2005; Flannery et al. 2005). While this trend is unfortunate and does not necessarily advance the field, using as many techniques as possible to gather data at all levels \u2013 stylistic, mineralogical, and chemical \u2013 provides a middle ground as well as providing data that may be able to more completely address questions of how and why people manufactured material culture in the manner that they did. Ultimately, it allows archaeologists to answer emic behaviour based on the etic phenomenon of the material record (e.g., Cecil 2001; Lechtman 1977; Lemonnier 1992). The case study that follows is an attempt to demonstrate that neither nonarchaeometric nor archaeometric analyses alone would be able to answer how Pet\u00e9n Postclassic potters defined themselves through their material culture. I conjoin classification, hardness, colour, and form measurements with mineralogical and chemical analyses to define the technological styles of the two main warring Pet\u00e9n Postclassic socio-political groups at the time of the Spanish conquest. Case Study The Postclassic (AD 900\u20131525) and Contact (AD 1525\u20131697) periods in central Pet\u00e9n are characterized by numerous socio-political groups migrating to and from northern Yucat\u00e1n to the central Pet\u00e9n region (Figure 9.1) and coexisting in a relatively isolated area (Bullard 1970; Cecil 2001, 2004; Chase 1983; Jones 1989, 1998; Jones et al. 1981; Rice et al. 1996; P. M. Rice 1987a). While the Itz\u00e1, Kowoj, Mopan, and Kejach may have co-existed, they were not peaceful (Jones 1998). Instead, the socio-political groups fought wars with each 9: Archaeometric and Non-archaeometric Techniques \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 9.1. Postclassic Archaeological Sites in the Central Pet\u00e9n Lakes Region. other and gained and lost territory and political dominance. As a result, social and political boundaries may have been created to enhance and enforce social differences. Although a number of socio-political groups may have lived in the central Pet\u00e9n lakes region, the Itz\u00e1 and Kowoj were best documented by the Spanish. The Itz\u00e1 dominated territory west and south of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. They claimed ancestry from the archaeological site of Chich\u2019en Itz\u00e1 in northern Yucat\u00e1n and are said to have migrated from there to the Pet\u00e9n lakes region before the Spanish conquest (Jones 1998:22). The head of the ruling Kan Ek\u2019 lineage of the Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 also stated that his family still lived there (Jones 1998:11). In Pet\u00e9n, the Itz\u00e1 made their capital at Nojpeten (modern-day Flores Island) and may have controlled the archaeological sites of Ch\u2019ich,\u2019 Tayasal, Ixl\u00fa, Macanch\u00e9 Island, Yalain, and Tipuj. Their absolute control of Ixl\u00fa, Yalain, and Tipuj is questionable as these sites may have changed hands when borders were contested and redrawn (Cecil and Neff 2006; Jones 1998:6, 11). Architecture and burial/cache patterns at sites in the Itz\u00e1 territory are similar to architecture and burial pat- \u0018\u0018\u0018 LESLIE G. CECIL terns found at Chich\u2019en Itz\u00e1 (Duncan 2005; Proskouriakoff 1962; Rice 1986; Rice et al. 1996). The Kowoj occupied the northern and eastern part of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Lake Salpet\u00e9n. They claimed to have migrated from Mayap\u00e1n around AD 1530 as a result of Spanish contact and political turmoil (Jones 1998:27\u201328). However, the earliest migration may have been at approximately AD 1200 given that Kowoj architecture with that date exists at Topoxt\u00e9 Island (Hermes and Noriega 1997). The Kowoj may have controlled the sites of Zacpet\u00e9n, Topoxt\u00e9 Island, and possibly Ixl\u00fa and Tipuj. Pet\u00e9n Kowoj architecture and burial/cache patterns are similar to those found at Mayap\u00e1n (Duncan 2005; Proskouriakoff 1962; Pugh 2001). In order to identify pottery manufacturing patterns of the Kowoj, and to some extent the Itz\u00e1, I conducted non-archaeometric and archaeometric analyses of the three Pet\u00e9n Postclassic slipped wares: Clemencia Cream Paste, Vitzil Orange-Red, and Snail Inclusion Paste (Cecil 2001, 2004; Cecil and Neff 2006). The resulting data from each technique provided results that by themselves did not produce much information about behavioural choices during the manufacturing process, but by conjoining the non-archaeometric and archaeometric data I was able to conclude something more meaningful about socio-political identities and pottery manufacture during the Postclassic period. Methods of Analysis The first level of analysis, non-archaeometric, consisted of a typological examination (type variety system) of all Postclassic sherds excavated from the archaeological sites of Ch\u2019ich,\u2019 Ixl\u00fa, Zacpet\u00e9n, and Tipuj (Smith et al. 1960). The data gathered by the type variety system include observations about ceramic pastes, degree of dark coring, core colour, hardness, and firing temperatures, slips (colour, hardness, and firing temperatures), forms and form measurements, and regional and inter-regional distribution. Through the examination of pottery at this preliminary level of analysis, I was able to note the variation in the painted and incised decorations, the presence and absence of decorative motifs, the number of form categories and the range of sizes, and the firing and slip technologies in the Pet\u00e9n lakes region during the Postclassic period (Cecil 2001). While the differences were not numerous, variations in pastes, slips, and 9: Archaeometric and Non-archaeometric Techniques \u0018\u0018\u0018 decorations of the different types and varieties suggested that while the Pet\u00e9n Postclassic potters may have not perfected their manufacturing process, their decorative program was well established. Since these conclusions did not fully answer the research questions asked, I incorporated archaeometric techniques. Based on the preliminary technological style groups developed from the non-archaeometric analyses, I selected a sample of sherds for further petrographic thin-section analysis to better identify slip characteristics and non-plastic inclusions, minerals, and rock fragments in the clay paste (Cecil 2001). In addition to identifying the presence of various minerals, I also recorded the abundance, association, granulometry, and shape of the minerals and other inclusions in the clay paste (Cecil 2001; Childs 1989; Middleton et al. 1985; Orton et al. 1993). As a result of the petrographic analysis, I identified multiple compositional groups within each ceramic ware (Cecil 2001:422\u2013424). Clemencia Cream Paste wares form three mineralogical groups: clay pastes that lack mineral inclusions and have an abundance of pores (volcanic ash); clay pastes with biotite; and clay pastes with biotite, chert, chalcedony, and quartz. Vitzil Orange-Red ware sherds form two basic groups: those with an abundance of pores (volcanic ash); and pastes with minerals. The second group may be divided further to those with an abundance of quartz and those with an abundance of calcite; however, the division was not made because of the small number of sherds with quartz inclusions. Finally, Snail Inclusion Paste ware sherds also formed two basic groups: pastes with biotite, chert, and chalcedony; and those lacking biotite, chert, and chalcedony. While the petrographic analysis provided information concerning manufacturing details (clay recipes), I added acid-digestion inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP-ES) to analyze the sherd pastes (Burton and Simon 1996) and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) to analyze the exterior slips and red and black pigments used for decoration (Neff 2003). These differences indicated subtle variations in the manufacturing processes that may designate different technological styles, socio-political identities, resource restrictions due to territorial boundaries, and Postclassic trade. When the chemical compositions of the ceramic pastes were analyzed using multivariate analyses (principle component analysis and cluster analysis), seven groups occurred (Cecil 2001). For the most part, the division of the seven groups cannot be confirmed with Mahalanobis distance statistics, but the dif\u0018\u00180 LESLIE G. CECIL ferences appear to be emically significant. The seven chemical compositional groups conform to Pet\u00e9n Postclassic ware categories: Groups 1, 6, and 7 are the Clemencia Cream Paste ware samples; Groups 2 and 3 represent the Vitzil Orange-Red ware sherds; and Groups 4 and 5 consist of the Snail Inclusion Paste ware samples. While the paste chemical composition data do not add an entirely new set of characteristics to the previously established groups based on the other techniques discussed above, the chemical composition analysis of the exterior slips and red and black pigments used for decoration do (Cecil and Neff 2006). Postclassic Maya potters used different exterior red slips for different vessel forms (jars and bowls versus tripod plates) in the Vitzil Orange-Red and Clemencia Cream Paste wares. Perhaps this difference has to do with vessel function. Additionally, they used different exterior red slips for decorated and undecorated, but slipped vessels. Red and black paint pigments are also chemically distinct from those used for exterior slips (Cecil and Neff 2006). Not only were the exterior slip pigments different than those used for decoration, but the red pigments used to decorate in red-and-black decorative programs were also chemically distinct from those used to decorate only in red. Additionally, red decoration on the higher quality Clemencia Cream Paste ware pottery also has a different chemical composition than that on lower quality pottery. Maya Postclassic potters also used different black pigments depending on the motif used (hooks and reptiles versus mats, circles, and birds) and if the black pigment was part of a red-and-black decorative program. Putting It All Together When data from the non-archaeometric and archaeometric analyses were combined, seven interesting technological and stylistic combinations occur that reflect operational sequence choices and may reflect different social/ethnic identities (Cecil 2001). While the technological style groupings were not dependent on the acid-digestion ICP-ES analysis, the technological style group numbering follows the numbering for the sherd paste chemical composition groups (Groups 1\u20137). Table 9.1 illustrates the combination of technological and stylistic characteristics of the seven distinct groups. 9: Archaeometric and Non-archaeometric Techniques \u0018\u0018\u0018 Table 9.1.

This is because technological styles result from choices made by Postclassic Pet\u00e9n Maya potters within a social structure that embodies their identity. As such, the patterns of manufacture are not merely \u201c\u2018added on\u2019 in order to signal group identity\u201d but are choices made by the potter \u201cby which a sense of group identity is formed and transformed as being coeval with and identical to \u0018\u0018\u0018 LESLIE G. CECIL the process by which a sense of technique is formed and transformed\u201d (Dietler and Herbich 1998:247). A sense of group identity may have been important in Postclassic Pet\u00e9n because of the unstable conditions brought on by wars, changing social boundaries, and changing positions of dominance. As such, Maya potters, as well as other members of Maya society, may have continually constructed and reconstructed their identity by creating and recreating their social structures through daily activities such as pottery manufacture (Giddens 1984:17). The \u201challmark\u201d signature of Kowoj pottery is red-on-paste decoration that first appears on Clemencia Cream Paste ware pottery with the florescence of Chompoxt\u00e9 Red-on-paste pottery (Figure 9.2). Clemencia Cream Paste ware pottery is thought to have been produced at and traded from the Kowoj site of Topoxt\u00e9 Island from the Early to early Late Postclassic periods (ca. AD 900\u20131450) and is traded to sites in the eastern portion of the Pet\u00e9n lakes region and Tipuj. Interestingly, the majority of Clemencia Cream Paste ware pottery at Tipuj is of inferior quality, whereas the majority of this pottery at Zacpet\u00e9n is of a higher quality. This may suggest closer ties between the inhabitants at Topoxt\u00e9 Island and Zacpet\u00e9n than those between Topoxt\u00e9 Island and Tipuj. I believe that this pottery and the civic-ceremonial architecture that resembles that of Mayap\u00e1n represent Kowoj social identity and Kowoj occupation at Topoxt\u00e9, Zacpet\u00e9n, and Tipuj. This pottery does not appear at archaeological sites in the western portion of the Pet\u00e9n lakes region, suggesting that sociopolitical boundaries had been established to separate the Itz\u00e1 and Kowoj. The Kowoj traditions/customs began at Topoxt\u00e9 Island continued at Zacpet\u00e9n (when Topoxt\u00e9 was abandoned) throughout the Postclassic period. At Zacpet\u00e9n, the Kowoj recreated red-on-paste decoration on local clays with gray pastes (Snail Inclusion Paste ware) to reinforce their social/ethnic identity. In addition to red-on-paste decoration, red-and-black decoration also indicates Kowoj social identity. These same traits are seen at Mayap\u00e1n in their buffcoloured pottery (Smith 1971). On the other hand, Itz\u00e1 socio-political identity may be represented by Vitzil Orange-Red and Snail Inclusion Paste wares with the presence of black painted reptilian (kan) and hook motifs that may reflect the ruling Kan Ek\u2019 lineage of the Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. More research needs to be conducted at Itz\u00e1 archaeological sites before this category can be expanded. 9: Archaeometric and Non-archaeometric Techniques \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 9.2.

CECIL In sum, my comparison of pottery technological style data with multiple lines of evidence from the archaeological sites of Ch\u2019ich,\u2019 Ixl\u00fa, Zacpet\u00e9n, and Topoxt\u00e9 Island in Pet\u00e9n and Tipuj in Belize suggest that Pet\u00e9n Postclassic potters produced and reproduced pottery technological styles as part of the social identities. In addition to defining technological styles and determining their socio-political affiliation, this study demonstrates that the analysis of technological style and the interpretations concerning the complex socio-political milieu could not have been made without the contribution of both non-archaeometric and archaeometric analyses. While non-archaeometric techniques are not en vogue, they are the base from which sampling occurs for the archaeometric techniques and do contribute to an archaeologist\u2019s understanding of ancient potters\u2019 actions and their socio-political milieu and should not be dismissed as useless and time-consuming.

CECIL 10 Stable Isotope Analysis of Marine Shell to Determine Geogr aphic Provenience: Implications for Prehistoric Tr ade Route Research Tobin C. Bottman Abstract. For more than 10,000 years, North American coastal peoples traded with groups from the interior. Archaeological excavations provide a material record of these interactions, generally in the form of marine shell objects found at inland sites and obsidian toolstone at coastal sites. Numerous trade route proposals have been formulated for the procurement and movement of these goods. While geochemical analysis has been used for decades to source obsidian artefacts, the same has not been possible for shell artefacts. With such a large distribution along the coast and no reliable sourcing techniques, locating the geographic origin of spire- lopped Olivella biplicata beads has been problematic. Past research has proven oxygen and carbon isotope analysis to be successfully utilized in estimating the seasonality of marine shell collection and recreating palaeo-environments. Since oxygen and carbon isotope levels in shell are related to the water parameters from mine the relative geographic provenience of specific shells. Isotopic analyses of which the shells originate, analysis of these isotopes can also be used to deter23 O. biplicata beads collected from five Northern Great Basin archaeological sites \u0018\u0018\u0018 predominantly suggest Southern California as a primary shell collection source. tion can be refined. Utilizing this process, current and future models of prehistoric trade and interac- Introduction For thousands of years, the peoples of the Pacific Coast and the Great Basin exchanged technology, art, and goods. Archaeological excavations from within this vast geographic region have provided material record of this cultural interaction, generally in the form of marine shell objects found at inland sites and obsidian tools excavated in coastal sites. For years, obsidian trace element analysis has been used to source the obsidian to specific flows, each of which have their own unique chemical signature. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for marine shell artefacts found inland. Many of the molluscan species used in the manufacture of shell tools and ornaments, particularly Olivella biplicata shells, naturally occur along large sections of the Pacific coast, from present-day Alaska to Mexico. With such a large distribution along the coast and no reliable sourcing techniques, geographic positioning for the origin of shell artefacts has remained problematic. Over the last twenty years, Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) and Galm (1994), among others, have studied prehistoric artefact exchange patterns between the coast and the interior. This research has most often been accomplished by analyzing artefact typologies and comparing them to patterns discerned in adjacent areas. Unfortunately, given the wide geographic range of O. biplicata, coupled with the long temporal span of the spire lopped bead variety, typological dating and sourcing has been impossible. Oxygen and carbon isotopic analysis has been used for many years to estimate seasonality of marine shells found in archaeological contexts (see Kennett and Voorhies 1996; Shackleton and Renfrew 1970). Levels of these elements are related to the water conditions in which the shell formed. As such, these isotopic parameters may also be used to determine the relative geographic origin of specific shells as there is little overlap in oxygen and carbon isotope values between different coastal areas. Consequently, by comparing oxygen and carbon isotope levels in archaeological specimens recovered from provenience- \u0018\u00180 tobin C. Bottman controlled contexts to natural specimens collected along the Pacific Coast, it may be possible to discern changing patterns of shell ornament acquisition through space and time. Applying a similar method, Shackleton and Renfrew (1970) successfully sourced Spondylus artefacts to reconstruct Neolithic trade routes in Europe. Shell sourcing research conducted by Eerkens et al. (2005) has focused primarily on Olivella biplicata beads from Late Holocene deposits in California. This research includes the construction of a modern O. biplicata shell oxygen and carbon isotope profile for the Oregon and California coastlines to aid in determinations of geographic provenience. This baseline data permits the comparison of O. biplicata beads from other time periods and cultural areas. As the bulk of the O. biplicata beads excavated in Oregon date to the Middle Holocene (7,600 to 3,000 cal. BP), my research was focused on beads from this period that were recovered from archaeological sites located just a few kilometres from one another in the lowlands of the Fort Rock Basin, in the Northern Great Basin of Oregon, and housed in collections at the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Hypotheses concerning the prehistoric trade routes that conveyed shell beads hundreds of kilometres inland have generally been limited by a lack of scientific evidence. Stable isotope analysis of shell beads proves to be a reliable way to test these hypotheses by providing an additional tool to decipher prehistoric exchange patterns and routes of acquisition from the Pacific Coast to the interior for any type of shell artefact. Background Cultural Setting Located in the northwestern corner of the Great Basin, the Fort Rock Basin has long supported various groups of people. In fact, archaeological evidence suggests over 13,000 years of human occupation in and around the basin (Bedwell 1973; Wingard 2001). Formed of upthrust volcanic tuff and worn by waves from Palaeo Fort Rock Lake (Freidel 1994:32), Fort Rock is the focal point of the area. The Fort Rock Basin is divided by two low ridges into three, discrete, sub-basins (Freidel 1994:22) (Figure 10.1). The northernmost sub-basin is the 10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 10.1. Map of the Fort Rock Basin located in the Northern Great Basin of Oregon showing archaeological sites and associated geographic features. Fort Rock Valley, with Christmas Valley to the east and Silver Lake Valley to the south. Fort Rock and Silver Lake valleys are connected by a series of channels that once filled a chain of freshwater lakes and marshes during periods of increased precipitation (Jenkins 1994a:601; Jenkins et al. 2004b). For unlike the arid desert conditions present today, moist climatic conditions common to the Middle Holocene supported this channel system (Jenkins et al. 2004b). The archaeological sites included in this study are located along this system of channels. The Bergen, Big M, Bowling Dune, Carlon Village, and DJ Ranch sites are all lowland sites and all located within a few kilometres of the others (see Figure 10.1). Archaeological evidence suggests varying occupational patterns throughout the last 13,000 years, often hinging on ecological and demographic fluctuations (Jenkins et al. 2004a). There is very little evidence to suggest long-term habitation during the Early Holocene as most sites appear to have been stops on the \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C. Bottman seasonal rounds of small populations of people (Jenkins et al. 2004a). However, evidence from the latter portion of the Middle Holocene (6,000 to 3,000 cal. BP) lowland basin lakeshore sites illustrates more comprehensive settlement patterns (Jenkins et al. 2004a). It was at this time that substantial houses, large storage pits, and imported items such as beads appear in the archaeological record (see Helzer 2004; Jenkins 1994b, 2000, 2004; Jenkins et al. 2004c; Largaespada 2001; Moessner 2004). At around 3,000 cal. BP, evidence of these comprehensive occupations is no longer visible, coinciding initially with an intense regional drought (Wigand 1987). This drought likely affected food resources and initiated a seasonal movement of peoples to exploit root crops (Jenkins et al. 2004b). Although many archaeologists consider shell beads to be identifiers of wealth, social status, and group affiliation, their actual value and utility during prehistory is unknown. King has argued that beads are representative of a currency that can be saved as a form of excess energy and as such had an innate value to many populations (1974:80). The fact that shell beads, originating from sources on the Pacific Coast, are excavated from archaeological deposits located hundreds of kilometres inland attests to this. During ethnographic times, beads were traded widely between distinct regions of North America. This was also the case during the Middle and Late Holocene as beads manufactured out of exotic materials are present in the archaeological record (Jenkins and Wimmers 1994). The presence of shell beads at archaeological sites indicate the existence of sophisticated trade alliances and levels of social complexity that few other artefacts provide. This has prompted the construction of numerous trade route proposals and hypotheses based at least in part on shell beads (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987; Erickson 1990; Galm 1994; Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986; Jenkins and Erlandson 1997; Raab and Howard 2000) (Figure 10.2). Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) identified four California trade centres active by the Late Holocene. They proposed that trade centres were located in northern, central, and southern California, as well as the Gulf of California (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:154\u2013155) with the western sector of the Great Basin serving as the primary shell redistribution centre by about 8,000 BP. They proposed that these four exchange networks had little if any impact on the Northern Great Basin during the Middle Holocene; however, it must be noted that, at the time Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) was published, they considered the Northern Great Basin in Oregon to be a peripheral area as only three sites 10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 10.2. Map of western North America showing the physiographic Great Basin, hypothesized shell collection centers and trade routes. \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C. Bottman yielding eight shell beads were known to exist (1987:156). The northern California network provides the shallowest time depth, with the exception of some beads recovered from the Snake River region in Idaho (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:154). The southern California exchange network was deemed to be most important to groups living in the southwestern areas of the Great Basin like Death and Owens valleys (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:155). Bennyhoff and Hughes concluded that the Gulf of California exchange network was of the least significance to Great Basin peoples (1987:155). By the beginning of the Late Holocene, Bennyhoff and Hughes posited that the Central California exchange network was dominant (between 4,000 and 2,200 BP) and that the O. biplicata A1 and B2 bead types were originating there, with a few large specimens likely collected from northern Californian waters (1987:160). They also proposed that beads from this early Middle Archaic Period were likely traded along the same trans-Sierran trail network as obsidian (Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986:255). However, in the Fort Rock Basin, Olivella beads have been most commonly encountered in Early and Middle Holocene deposits (Largaespada 2001). Bennyhoff and Hughes speculated that beads recovered from Early Holocene deposits (excavated in the Lower Snake River region) were derived from the Oregon or Washington coast (1987:154). Hughes and Bennyhoff (1986:246) have also suggested a non-Californiabased network centred on the Columbia River Plateau area. This exchange route consisted of shell goods collected along northern California, Oregon, and southern Washington coasts coming inland along the Columbia River and distributed along the Deschutes and Umpqua rivers down into the Northern Great Basin (Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986:Figure 1). They proposed that spire lopped O. biplicata beads in the Northern Great Basin likely originated in northern California (Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986:247). Raab and Howard (2000) have proposed a \u201cUto-Aztecan Interaction Sphere\u201d involving Southern Channel Island populations from the Santa Barbara Channel in direct contact with groups in the Western Great Basin during the Middle Holocene. This hypothesis is based specifically on the recovery of Olivella Grooved Rectangle (OGR) (Type N, Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987) beads from sites in the Northern Great Basin (Jenkins and Erlandson 1997) and the Southern Channel Islands (Vellanoweth 1995). They have hypothesized that related Takic-speaking peoples from the Southern Channel Islands were in contact with other Uto-Aztecan language family speakers throughout the 10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Northern Great Basin (Raab and Howard 2000:595). They believe this UtoAztecan language family route followed the western Numic frontier in eastern California south of the Sierra Nevada\u2019s and continuing up into Oregon (Raab and Howard 2000:595). Jenkins et al. (2004c) hypothesized that the most direct route into the Great Basin, along the eastern Sierra Nevada \u2013 Cascade Front, would have likely been utilized. This route, leading through the Owens Valley, into the Carson sink, and north to the Fort Rock Basin, would have been quite hospitable for travel during the moist climatic conditions common during the Middle Holocene in the Northern Great Basin (Jenkins et al. 2004c:264). Rather than a strict focus on the Great Basin, Galm (1994) and Erickson (1990) have focused their efforts in discerning trade patterns within the greater Columbia Plateau region. However, these trade postulations either directly or indirectly include involvement of Great Basin populations. Central to their models is the concept of multiple trade routes. Galm (1994) has proposed \u201cThe Dalles \u2013 Deschutes\u201d trade network extending across the Southern Columbia Plateau to the north of the Fort Rock Basin during the Middle Holocene. While citing no direct evidence for trade into the Fort Rock area, Galm has also proposed a Great Basin exchange network for the movement of beads and obsidian into the Columbia Plateau region (1994:297) as well as the coastal trade network travelling inland along the Columbia River (1994:298). Erickson (1990:131) has proposed a similar trade model for the Middle Holocene, one that is dependant upon trade material source. He posited that the most direct route into the Plateau area would be from Oregon or Washington coast sources, travelling along the Columbia River Gorge, while acknowledging that finds in the Northern Great Basin would indicate a trans-Sierran movement (sensu Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987) from the central California coast towards the interior. Like Galm, he questions the feasibility of assuming a single point of origin for shell bead trade for both the Great Basin and Southern Plateau (Erickson 1990:131). Contemporary Trade Models The above hypotheses can be summarized by the formation of three primary shell acquisition models (see Figure 10.2). The specific parameters of these three models can then be tested by oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis in \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C. Bottman order to determine the movements of shell ornaments and their possible trade routes into and through the Northern Great Basin. Model #1 \u2013 By the end of the Middle Holocene, a Central California exchange network, centred around San Francisco Bay, was dominant (between 2000 and 200 B.C.) and that the O. biplicata A1 and B2 bead types were originating there, with a few large specimens originating from northern Californian waters (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:160). These beads were then traded through a Western Great Basin exchange hub (Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986:255). Model #2 \u2013 A \u201cUto-Aztecan Interaction Sphere\u201d involving Southern Channel Island peoples were in direct contact with groups in the Western Great Basin during the Middle Holocene (Raab and Howard 2000). These beads would then follow a route into the Great Basin along the eastern Sierra Nevada\u2013Cascade front. Previous research has indicated that temporally and geographically sensitive Olivella Grooved Rectangle beads were manufactured in the Southern Channel Islands and followed a similar route of dispersal (Jenkins and Erlandson 1997; Raab and Howard 2000; Vellanoweth 1995; Vellanoweth et al. 1996). Model #3 \u2013 This model relies upon the utilization of multiple trade routes involving coastal as well as Great Basin routes. \u201cThe Dalles \u2013 Deschutes\u201d (Galm 1994:298) trade network, featuring goods travelling inland along the Columbia River and extending across into the Southern Columbia Plateau during the Middle Holocene, as well as a Great Basin exchange network for the movement of beads and obsidian into the Columbia Plateau region (Galm 1994:297; Hughes and Bennyhoff 1986), has been proposed. A trans-Sierran trade route from the central Californian coast may have supplied this Great Basin network (Erickson 1990:131). These models of Great Basin bead trade patterns have depended on assumptions concerning the provenience of the raw materials acquired. This is particularly problematic for spire lopped O. biplicata beads due to their exceptionally wide geographic and temporal distributions. The ability to source the shell beads to general geographic sources will have dramatic consequences for these and future trade route proposals. 10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Methods Bead Data Olivella biplicata beads are manufactured from the shell of a small (8 to 38 mm) gastropod living in the Pacific Ocean. They have a wide geographic distribution and can be found in marine waters stretching from Baja, Mexico, to Sitka Alaska (Sept 2001:77). O. biplicata occupy sandy strata from low tide level to depths of 46 metres (Sept 2001:77) often in groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals. Shell coloration varies, but purple- and cream-coloured bodies are common and often feature orange, purple, or blue striping. Archaeological specimens are generally cream- to white-coloured. O. biplicata beads were manufactured in many different styles. Bennyhoff and Hughes identified seventeen different classes of beads manufactured from Olivella shells, notated A through Q (1987:85). Bead classes are delineated by the construction methods and shell parts utilized and include spire altered, wall, shelf, callus, and columella type beads (see Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:89, Figure 10.1). These bead types were manufactured at different times by different populations throughout the Holocene. The majority of the twenty-three O. biplicata beads analyzed are all classified per the Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) typology as being of the Class A variety (Table 10.1). Class A denotes a nearly complete Olivella shell with only the spire removed either by grinding, breaking, or natural water-wear (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:116). Further subdivision of Class A beads into types a (small), b (medium) and c (large) is based on size using maximum diameter as a measure (Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987:117). While type A beads were manufactured using six different species of Olivella, only beads manufactured from O. biplicata were used for this study. \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C. Bottman Table 10.1.

The ratio of 16O and 18 O in shell carbonate (aragonite and/or calcite) depends on the temperature and salinity of the seawater in which the shell formed (Urey 1947). The salinity and temperature gradients of the ocean vary depending on both geographic positioning and seasonal fluctuations. These ambient ocean conditions are \u2018recorded\u2019 in the chemical signature of mollusc shells. Unique regional patterns can be discerned by taking multiple incremental samples of the shell carbonate across growth lines, thus mitigating seasonal fluctuations. Shell 18O levels are primarily affected by temperature and salinity and these gradients are quite distinct along the Pacific Coast. While there is some seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) overlap, overall coastal temperature signatures are distinct over larger geographic areas. Summer ocean temperatures in the waters of the Santa Barbara area peak between 16\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 Celsius, between 12\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 Celsius in Monterey Bay and between 9\u00b0 and 12\u00b0 Celsius around southern Oregon (Eerkens et al. 2005). Given the scarcity of freshwater outlets into the Pacific, fluctuations in salinity are slight in southern Californian waters; however, north of Point Conception, slightly lower salinities occur in the winter months due to increased freshwater input from streams and rivers (Eerkens et al. 2005). Seasonal upwelling events, initiated by dissolved inorganic carbon, have been found to affect shell 13C (Shackleton and Renfrew 1970). These upwelling events are common in parts of the California coast and generally occur between the months of April and July (Eerkens et al. 2005). More negative oxygen isotope values indicate warmer ocean temperatures; more positive values signify cooler temperatures. More negative carbon isotope values indicate more extensive upwelling events; more positive values suggest less intense upwelling. Eerkens et al. (2005) have analyzed numerous modern O. biplicata shells collected from southern Oregon, northern California, and the Santa Barbara Channel. Three distinct isotopic signatures have been identified: a northern California/southern Oregon signature, a Santa Rosa/Santa Barbara Mainland \u0018\u00180 tobin C. Bottman signature, and a Santa Cruz Island signature. While there is some overlap of isotopic values, Eerkens et al. (2005) have demonstrated that the 18O present in Olivella biplicata shells are affected by the interplay of sea temperature and salinity, and 13C levels by upwelling events and that these water parameter levels have little overlap along the California and Oregon coasts. By extracting multiple samples per shell, seasonal SST overlap can be accounted for and oxygen and carbon isotopes can be geographically sensitive (Eerkens et al. 2005). While the overall resolution and accuracy of geographic provenience determinations via oxygen and carbon isotopic data is still being investigated, isotopic values from north and south of Point Conception are readily discernable and O. biplicata shells can be reliably sourced to at least that level of resolution (Eerkens et al. 2005:4). Despite the relatively stable nature of marine parameters since the beginning of the Middle Holocene, research by Kennett and Kennett (2000) has shown that there have been millennial scale SST oscillations during this time. There have been warm and cool water temperature intervals throughout the Holocene and these periods may have had an effect on oxygen isotopic levels present in prehistoric shells and beads. The coldest SSTs occurred between 1500 and 500 BP and the warmest between 5,900 and 3,800 BP (Kennett 2005:67). The resolution of the SST records is more refined than that of radiocarbon dates, but impacts to shell isotope values from these SST fluctuations can be approximated. For the present study, three samples were taken per bead at 2\u20133 millimetre increments, depending on overall shell size. Extracting three samples across growth lines mitigates the effects of natural seasonal fluctuations in isotopic values. Into the Early Holocene, large fluctuations in isotopic values had occurred due to post-glacial sea-level rise. Global sea levels rose from approximately \u201360 metres 12,000 years ago to near present levels by about 6,000 years ago (Stott et al. 2004). To avoid problems related to changing ocean chemistry through time, only Middle and Late Holocene aged beads (less than 7,600 cal. BP) recovered from carefully excavated, undisturbed, and dated contexts were utilized in the present research. The shell beads were prepared for sampling by a thorough cleansing process. They were rinsed with deionized water to remove loose surface dirt and debris, dried in an oven, and the process repeated until all visible organic material was removed. The shells were then etched with a solution of 5 per cent hydrochlo10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 ric acid to remove any diagenetically altered carbonate and then rinsed again and dried. Samples were extracted with a dental drill equipped with 1/32-inch bits. Each sample was screened for impurities under a microscope before being transferred to a glass vial. Samples were then sent to stable isotope laboratories located at the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Science at Oregon State University and the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Both laboratories utilize a Finnegan-MAT 252 mass spectrometer with a kiel carbonate inlet system ensuring comparable results. Results The oxygen and carbon isotopic data from the twenty-three Olivella biplicata beads were compared to the O. biplicata baseline shell data published by Eerkens et al. (2005) (Figure 10.3). The initial results indicated strong evidence for southern California as the primary O. biplicata shell collection centre for the beads analyzed from the five Northern Great Basin sites. Thus, SST records from the Santa Barbara Channel were utilized to correct the oxygen (18O) isotopic results. Some isotopic values suggest shell collection from waters warmer than those present in the Northern Channel Islands, but data for the Southern Channel Islands and points south were unavailable at the time of writing. The results are organized into arbitrary time periods only in an attempt for simplicity and clarity and are not indicative of any established periods. Isotopic results from the three beads dating to the Late Holocene (Figure 10.4) are consistent with values garnered from southern California. Bead number 1, excavated from the Carlon Village site and dating to approximately 1650 cal. BP, appears to have been gathered from waters south of the Northern Santa Barbara Channel. This time period featured normal SST levels and isotopic skew is unlikely. Bead numbers 2 and 3 are also from the Carlon Village site but date to approximately 600 cal. BP. These two beads likely originated from the same occupational period and their isotopic values accordingly cluster rather tightly together. This time period exhibited colder than present SST levels, which may have skewed the oxygen isotopic values up to three parts per mil more than the oxygen isotopic results indicate. This would indicate isotopic values completely in the range common to Santa Barbara and the Northern Channel Islands. \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C.

Beads recovered from 4,000- to 3,000-year-old deposits (Figure 10.5) generally displayed greater 13 C values than the beads from the Late Holocene. Bead numbers 8 and 10 were recovered from the Bergen Site and date to approximately 3,820 cal. BP. SST levels at this time were in a transitional phase, but an 18O shift of more than one or two mil in either direction is unlikely. This places bead numbers 8 and 10 in the isotopic range of both the Santa Barbara Channel area, as well as the warmest limits of the northern California levels. Bead number 21 (2,980 cal. BP), from the Bowling Dune site, appears to originate from southern California waters. There were slightly cooler SST\u2019s during this time, but the impacts to the oxygen isotopic signature are slight and only more fully support the Santa Barbara Channel as the likely shell source. Beads numbers 23 and 24, from DJ Ranch, date to 3,700 cal. BP. This coincides with cooler than normal sea surface temperatures and suggests that oxygen isotope values may be skewed up to one to two mil \u2018cooler\u2019 than they appear. This would more strongly suggest a shell source in southern California such as the Santa Barbara Channel. The isotopic results from the bead dating to between 5,000 and 4,000 BP (Figure 10.6) are strongly suggestive of a point of origin in southern California. This period coincides with a shift to warmer SST levels, influencing 18O values no more than approximately two per mil more positive. This would suggest that bead number 4 from the Bergen site (4,420 cal. BP) originated from an area south of Point Conception. Little to no overlap into northern California and southern Oregon isotopic values is expected, even in the event of a two-per-mil oxygen isotope value SST shift. The isotopic values of beads dating between 6,500 and 5,000 BP (Figure 10.7) indicate a wider range than any other period. This period of time represents periods of both warmer and cooler overall SST levels. Beads 6, 7, and 9 from Bergen, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20 from Big M, as well as bead number 22 from Bowling Dune, date to the period of warmer overall SST levels. Of these, the isotopic results of beads 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20 are strongly suggestive of a source in southern California, likely the Santa Barbara Channel itself. However, the isotopic values for beads 13 and 22 overlap slightly with values associated with more northerly areas, suggesting a central or northern California source. The isotopic values for bead number 7 are quite indicative of those associated with northern California and southern Oregon. While SST levels were only marginally lower at this time (on the order of 0.5 to 1 per mil 10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018\u0018 tobin C.

BP, respectively) date from the latter part of this period, a time of cooler SST levels. Both beads likely originated in southern California waters, though the isotopic values of bead 11 does overlap slightly into values associated with more northerly waters. Discussion Oxygen and carbon isotopic values from the twenty-three analyzed beads strongly indicate a southern California point of origin; many suggest procurement from the Santa Barbara Channel region specifically. The above results have interesting consequences for the existing trade route models discussed earlier. Models 1 and 3 feature trade networks centred north of Point Conception. While the isotopic data suggests that up to six beads (numbers 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 22) may have originated from more northerly waters, the current isotopic data strongly suggests a southern California point of origin. Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) proposed a southern California exchange network, though it was thought to be most important only for areas in the southwestern sector of the Great Basin like Death Valley during the Late Holocene. The southern California-based trade network of Model 2 is very well supported by the isotopic evidence obtained in the current research. This conclusion is also supported by the available evidence concerning the collection and dispersal of OGR beads (Jenkins and Erlandson 1997; Raab and Howard 2000; Vellanoweth 1995; Vellanoweth et al. 1996). While isotopic data for Southern Channel Islands O. biplicata are not currently available, a shell source zone located south of Point Conception, in the vicinity of the Northern and Southern Channel Islands, is very likely. North of Point Conception, marine isotopic values have been found to be distinct enough from the Santa Barbara Channel to strongly suggest such a conclusion. However, this shell sourcing technique is not free of complications and shortcomings. Overlapping modern shell isotopic values, sea water parameter changes through time, radiocarbon dating accuracy, a geographically limited modern shell data set, and a small archaeological bead sample size are some of the primary problems surrounding the process. Future research must ad10: Stable Isotope Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 dress these and other issues. These issues can be resolved in part by refining and expanding the modern O. biplicata data set, compiling comprehensive SST records for other coastal areas and sampling additional O. biplicata beads from more locales within the Great Basin. Conclusion The results of this research corroborate with previous research (i.e., Eerkens et al. 2005; Shackleton and Renfrew 1970) proving that shell sourcing via oxygen and carbon isotope analysis is a viable technique. The current isotopic data confirm that at least seventeen, but likely twenty-two, of the twenty-three O. biplicata beads analyzed from sites in the Fort Rock area of the Northern Great Basin of Oregon were of southern California origin. This research supports a shell trade network likely located in the vicinity of the Santa Barbara Channel area of southern California. This method of shell isotopic sourcing has proven to be an additional tool in the decipherment of the procurement and movement of prehistoric trade goods.

Yang, and E. Gwyn Langemann Abstract. Identification of cervid remains from archaeological sites can be challenging due to the lack of morphological criteria needed to determine the species ity to study the distribution of cervid species in the past, prior to the extensive alteration of their ecosystems and distributions in historic times. We used ancient DNA techniques in an attempt to obtain more accurate species identification from and subspecies level. Such difficulty of identification significantly limits our abil- archaeological cervid bone samples. Four bone samples were recovered from a from Rocky Mountain House National Historic Site (FcPr-4). The bone samples from precontact kill site (EhPv-126) near Banff town site, Banff National Park, and one Banff were in a component radiocarbon dated to 720 \u00b1 40 BP; the sample from 1821. DNA was successfully extracted from the remains; the analysis of the mtDNA Rocky Mountain House came from a feature that was in use between AD 1799 and control region indicates that four of the samples belong to elk (Cervus elaphus) \u0018\u0018\u0018 and one to moose (Alces alces). Four samples match the mtDNA control region sequence found in the Genbank data, pointing to the likelihood of Cervus elaphus nelsoni (elk). Although longer mtDNA might be needed to confirm the subspecies status of Cervus elaphus nelsoni and more bone samples are needed to examine the existence of other subspecies in the region, our results have clearly illustrated nal assemblages where morphological identification is difficult. Elk and moose are Mountains. More accurate species identification will help conservation biologists for ecological integrity. the potential to use molecular analysis to distinguish species in archaeological fauseldom identified in precontact archaeological material from the Canadian Rocky to make more informed decisions about managing modern ungulate populations Introduction Banff National Park of Canada is actively developing an integrated set of measures to restore bison to the ecosystem, to manage the concentrated occurrence of elk at the Banff town-site, to re-establish wildlife corridors connecting predators and prey, and to reintroduce fire to the landscape (Parks Canada 1997, 2004; White 2001). Zooarchaeological evidence can help in this process by supplying evidence for the former temporal and spatial range of various ungulate species (Kay et al. 1999; Langemann 2004; Lyman 2004; Shapiro et al. 2004; White et al. 2001). It is clear that accurate species and subspecies identification of archaeological remains would be very useful for conservation biologists to make more informed decisions about which species, subspecies, and populations should be reintroduced for managing modern ungulate populations for ecological integrity. Visual inspection cannot always identify the fragmented and poorly preserved bones that are usually found in mountain archaeological sites. Commonly, the small portion of an assemblage that is identifiable has only been identified to the level of \u201clarge ungulate\u201d or \u201csmall cervid.\u201d Therefore the relative abundance of species over time or space is difficult to assess. Elk were nearly extirpated in Banff and southern Alberta by the late 1800s, due to hunting pressure and habitat change. Modern elk populations are the result of restocking from populations in Manitoba and Yellowstone National \u0018\u0018\u0018 Maria Victoria Monsalve, Dongya Y. Yang, and E. Gwyn Langemann Park in Wyoming, as well as elk returning from British Columbia (Holroyd and Van Tighem 1983). Species and subspecies identification of archaeological elk remains will provide direct evidence and specific information about the presence of such species in the region. Using molecular analysis as a tool in the field of zooarchaeology, accurate identification of ancient biological remains has become possible (Bar-Gal et al. 2002; Barnes et al. 2000; Loreille et al. 1997). In this paper, we present the analysis of mtDNA from five zooarchaeological cervid bone fragments and address the question of which species are actually present in the otherwise unidentifiable archaeological bone assemblages. Materials and Methods In 1998 and 1999, archaeologists from Parks Canada recovered the remains of a late precontact period elk kill at a site beside the Golf Loop road, near Banff town-site in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada (Site EhPv-126, or 1210R in the Parks Canada system) (see Figure 11.1). At least five elk ranging in age between two and eight years had been intensively butchered. A calibrated and corrected radiocarbon date of 720 BP \u00b1 40 (BGS 2147) was obtained from an elk radius shaft bone. The bone layer is a tight component within the site, sealed above and below by sterile layers, and the bones of the different individuals are all mixed together in the archaeological floor. The bones from EhPv-126 were in an excellent state of preservation, but because they were intensively butchered, in most cases they could only be visually identified as large ungulate, probably cervid. Historic site 16R (FcPr-4) is one of several fur trading posts that are part of Rocky Mountain House National Historic Site of Canada, located in the foothills of west central Alberta (see Figure 11.1). The elk bone in question came from a cellar feature, which is interpreted as a trading room and hall building within the fort. This structure overlaps earlier pit features and so probably dates from the later period of the fort occupation (Steer and Rogers 1978). The bones were in an excellent state of preservation (see Figure 11.2). For this study, four large cervid bone samples were chosen from the precontact kill site 1210R. A distal humerus that was clearly elk was chosen from the Rocky Mountain House site. Table 11.1 presents a summary of the samples. 11: Molecular Analysis of Ancient Cervid Remains \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 11.1.

Each bone sample was cleaned and pulverized separately. Small sections of bone were removed from each of the samples, totalling approximately 4 to 8 grams. Extraction of ancient DNA and PCR Amplification at the University of British Columbia (UBC) was carried out in a laminar flow according to the methodology used (Yang et al. 1998). Double strands of the mtDNA control region from the samples were amplified using two sets of primers (CST15CST467 and MST29-MST24). PCR was run for 40 cycles. Ancient DNA extraction and PCR Amplification at Simon Fraser University (SFU) was conducted in a dedicated DNA laboratory built specifically for the ancient DNA analysis. A modified silica-spin column method (Yang et al. 1998) was employed for extracting DNA. PCR amplification was done using primers F136 and R316 in addition to the two sets of primers used at UBC. PCR was run for 50 cycles (see Figure 11.3). PCR products were purified and were subjected to direct sequencing. (Primer sequences are available upon request.) Sequences obtained on the amplification of three different fragment sizes of the mtDNA were aligned using the program ClustalW and search for identification of species and subspecies were made using the BLAST program (see Figure 11.4). \u0018\u0018\u0018 Maria Victoria Monsalve, Dongya Y.

Results Samples of DNA extracted from ancient bones were analyzed separately at UBC and SFU for this study. Sequences matched were searched in the Genbank data using the BLAST program (NCIB). The DNA extracted at UBC provided a 111 bp fragment of the control region of the mtDNA in five bones by PCR amplification using the primers MST29 and MST84. The amplification of these DNA samples was also successful at SFU and sequencing of PCR products indicated that all the samples belonged to the Cervidae family. Using primers CST15 and CST 467, PCR amplified products of 266 bp were obtained at UBC in all the samples. Only EK-3 and EK-5 gave readable sequences. Re-extraction of DNA of all five samples was carried out at SFU. Control mtDNA sequences were obtained in the other three cervid samples. Although the BLAST search revealed general match to those of elk, the poor quality of the sequences prevents a reliable base-to-base comparison with the elk DNA sequences used as references in GenBank. Using primers F136 and R319, PCR amplified products of 181 bp were obtained at SFU from supernatant DNA extractions performed at UBC. 11: Molecular Analysis of Ancient Cervid Remains \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 11.4.

Comparisons of the fragment sequences of the samples studied and sequences obtained in elk and moose (Polziehn and Strobeck 1998) indicated the following: 1) EK-1, EK-2, EK-4 share identical mtDNA sequences and the same DNA sequence as AF16964; 2) EK-5 shares the same mtDNA sequence as C. e nelsoni (AF16964) with the exception of a transition (C\u00e0T) at positions 8 and 55, a transition (T\u00e0C) at positions 12 and 16, and a transition (G\u00e0A) at position 56; 3) EK-3 shares the same mtDNA sequences as Alces alces (Yakutia AF412267, North American AF412240 and AF412244 samples) with the exception of a transition (A\u00e0G) at positions 55 and 140, a transition (T\u00e0C) at position 76, and a transversion (C\u00e0A) at position 77 (see Figure 11.4). \u0018\u0018\u0018 Maria Victoria Monsalve, Dongya Y. Yang, and E. Gwyn Langemann Discussion It is well known that ancient DNA research presents extreme difficulties because of the small amount of DNA that survives and the risks of contamination. This study followed the necessary steps described by Cooper and Poinar (2000) to avoid problems that are inherent in working with ancient DNA as follows: 1) dedicated areas for working with ancient DNA were independent of areas used for PCR amplification; 2) duplicate extractions with controls were carried out to detect contamination; 3) positive controls were avoided; 4) results were reproduced from the same and different DNA extracts from each specimen; 5) different primers were used to increase the chance of detecting contamination by PCR products; 6) independent laboratories extracted samples of the specimens. Analysis of mtDNA in archaeological bones has been applied to a variety of faunal species (Barnes et al. 2000; Loreille et al. 1997; Yang et al. 2004). Our study also demonstrates that the techniques used for working with ancient DNA might help to identify faunal remains to the level of sub-species in bone samples in which morphology has been ambiguous. Assignment of the elk sample as C. e. nelsoni (Rocky Mountain elk) might need confirmation by amplifying a longer DNA sequence, and DNA sequences from more samples, since 181 bp might be limited in securing such determination of subspecies. Nevertheless, this identification is consistent with the current distribution of Rocky Mountain elk (Hebblewhite et al. 2002; Polziehn et al.1998; Polziehn and Strobeck 2002). The use of DNA to identify excavated cervid remains in the Canadian Rockies is a valuable tool to make inferences about ecosystems in pre-Columbian times. It may support or refute hypotheses respecting occupancy by specific species in this region. Elk is rarely reported, but clearly, as the archaeological data show, elk was present 740 years ago in the Bow River valley. The identification of an ancient bone belonging to an Alces alces (moose) suggests the existence of a species seldom reported in pre-Columbian times. Moose and elk are both commonly identified in the historic archaeological assemblages at Rocky Mountain House (Nicol 1978, 1979). We determined that some of the ungulate long bones are in fact moose and not elk. This was a significant result. An elk site is rare enough, but it is extremely uncommon to find butchered moose bones in a pre-contact site in the Rocky Mountains. The study presented here 11: Molecular Analysis of Ancient Cervid Remains \u0018\u0018\u0018 is the first describing a pre-contact archaeological site in Banff that includes firmly identified butchered moose bones. Recent studies have established the habits and ecology of elk in the eastern Rocky Mountains and the foothills east of Banff and Jasper National Parks, extending east nearly to Rocky Mountain House (Central East Slopes Elk Study 2004; Hebblewhite 2002; Hebblewhite et al. 2002, 2005; Morgantini 1988). In the Bow River valley near Banff town-site and site 1210R, elk have recently become highly concentrated, where they are protected from predators. Recent changes in elk management through aversive conditioning and fencing, and predator restoration, have reduced the concentrations of elk in this part of the valley and moved them out more widely (Hebblewhite et al. 2002; Parks Canada 2004). Clearly, as the archaeological data show, elk were present in some numbers 740 years ago at this same location in the Bow River valley. The total number of fragments identifiable at least to element (NISP) in site EhPv-126 is 256, out of a total of 2,171. Because nearly all of the visually identifiable fragments were elk for a minimum number of individuals of five (based on the number of tooth rows), and only one fragment was moose (an incisive), the assumption could have been made in a standard visual analysis that the unidentifiable fragments are predominately elk as well, in a comparable ratio. However, one out of four samples in this study were identified by their DNA as moose, which gives a much larger relative proportion of moose to elk within the zooarchaeological assemblage than the visual identification. It will be necessary to re-examine the faunal assemblage, with a more careful comparison of the available moose and elk material. DNA allowed us to accurately identify which species were present in Banff National Park and Rocky Mountain House National Historic sites. In Banff, the reason that elk and moose have seldom been identified in sites may well be due to the poor preservation and extremely fragmented nature of bone, so that diagnostic anatomical features are not present on the small bits of bone; it may be due to the inexperience of analysts; or it may reflect a real shortage of elk and moose. These reasons all need to be more carefully considered. Some reviews of the zooarchaeological literature have used the absence of elk to argue that elk were not in fact ever present in any numbers (Kay et al. 1999). However, in EhPv-126 there is in fact a site where elk are by far the most abundantly represented species. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Maria Victoria Monsalve, Dongya Y. Yang, and E. Gwyn Langemann The historic fur trade sites are a different situation. Bone is often wellpreserved here because it is more recent and often deliberately buried in cellars or pits for hygiene. The species in these sites reflect animals hunted for food by inhabitants of the fort, as well as animals trapped for their furs. There is often a tighter time control, given the datable features at a historic site. At a site such as Rocky Mountain House, where there is a series of forts built over the years, comparison of the fauna may reflect the changes in abundance of local species over time. Studies of DNA in conjunction with archaeozoological data allow more precise identification of species and subspecies than was previously possible. Thus EK-5, identified as belonging to C. e nelsoni has a different haplotype than EK-1, EK-2, and EK-4. Interestingly, the EK-5 sample dated in the early 1800s was found in the Rocky Mountain House historic fur trade site located 140 km from EhPv-126. There are different rationales for this. Geographic isolation may account for different haplotypes in each of the two sites, or different elk haplotype frequencies may have predominated in pre-Columbian and post-Columbian periods. DNA analysis of archaeological samples has been proven to be useful in determining how closely related various individuals were, at different places and times (Shapiro et al. 2004). It could also allow us to consider if elk populations before the local extirpation moved as widely and rapidly as some individuals do today in regions of the Rocky Mountains (Central East Slopes Elk Study 2004; Hebblewhite et al. 2002). Unfortunately, it is not common to find elk bones in a good excavated pre-contact archaeological context in the central Rocky Mountains, and our present sample is a small one. It is quite possible that at the time site EhPv-126 was occupied, 740 years ago, moose were more abundant in the Bow River valley than now. Humanignited fires were then more frequent (White 2001), renewing the early succession vegetation that moose prefer (Hurd 1999). It would be useful to attempt further molecular analysis of the bone fragments in order to see if more moose are present in the archaeological assemblage. 11: Molecular Analysis of Ancient Cervid Remains \u0018\u0018\u0018 Acknowledgments: We are grateful to UBC Bureau for Forensic Dentistry for some sample preparation; to Karl Hillis, Camilla Speller and Kathy Watt of D.

Although subarctic Athapaskan and northern Northwest Coast cultures are known more for their fisheries and hunting than plant use, plants formed a cies used for food and technology and review the kinds of evidence that might be significant component of the resource base. I describe types of plant uses and speencountered that would provide evidence of past plant use. Evidence on the land can provide evidence of bark stripping, plank removal, and old tree cutting and can reveal both spatial and chronological patterns of use. Bark may be stripped for comprises culturally modified trees [CMT\u2019s] and remains of in situ structures. CMT\u2019s technological uses [mats, basketry, cordage, roofing], for food [edible hemlock or pine cambium], or for medicinal uses [pine, spruce, and true fir barks and pitches]. Other evidence of past plant use on the land includes remains of dwellings, berry- drying racks, fish traps, caribou fences, deadfall traps, and the like. Anomalies in dicate past management and/or cultivation. Archaeobotanical methods, including recovery of remains from conventional archaeological sites, and the spectacular distributions of culturally significant plants such as Pacific crabapple may also in- finds of organic remains melting out of ice fields and glaciers, have also yielded insights into past plant uses, both corroborating ethnographic uses and revealing previously unknown uses. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Introduction Plant use by subarctic Athapaskan and northern Northwest peoples must be considered as an integral aspect of their cultures and in ecological context, incorporated in the seasonal round and all kinds of cultural activities. Although subarctic Athapaskan and northern Northwest Coast cultures are known more for their fisheries and hunting than plant use, plants formed a significant component of the resource base. In this largely forested and cool temperate to subarctic region, trees and woody shrubs were vital for construction materials, implements and containers, fuel, food resources and medicines. Various kinds of berries, especially species of the Ericaceae, were the most important plant foods; these were supplemented by spring greens and a few root foods in season. Bryophytes and lichens also contributed materials for technology and healing. In this paper I focus on the kinds of evidence that can indicate past plant uses by Subarctic Dene and northern Northwest Coast peoples. I have organized this paper by categories of evidence, moving across use classes and cultures throughout the discussion. Evidence of Past Plant Uses Chief classes of evidence of past plant use for northern Northwest Coast and subarctic Athapaskan peoples include: evidence on the land (culturally modified trees and remains of in situ structures), evidence from archaeological contexts (remains from wet sites and archaeobotanical evidence), and other evidence from ice fields and glaciers. Cultur ally Modified Trees Culturally Modified Trees (or CMTs) preserve records of bark use for various purposes, wood use, and \u2018miscellaneous use\u2019 where the CMT itself is the \u201cuse,\u201d as in dendroglyphs used as boundary markers and message boards (Figure 12.1d) (cf. Blackstock 1996). CMTs record types of use only within the period that living or recently dead trees remain on the landscape, and they are subject to destruction by forest clearance and other development, having been \u0018\u0018\u0018 Leslie Main Johnson only recently accorded a degree of protection. Nonetheless, they can document presence and resource use of local aboriginal populations in their traditional homelands (Muir and Moon 2000). Bark and wood use in technology. Western red cedar is utilized wherever it occurs for bark and for wood. Two main types of cedar CMTs in northwestern British Columbia are those scarred by removal of cedar planks (Figure 12.1a), and those scarred by removal of whole bark or inner bark (Figure 12.1b,c). Cedar planks, highly valued for construction, could be removed from living trees with a combination of adzes, stone mauls, and wedges. Such trees are predominantly found on the coast where very large and long-lived cedar trees were suitable for this activity and may still be present to preserve a record. Cedar bark on the northwest coast served many uses (Gottesfeld 1992; Stewart 1984; Turner 1998, 2004). Whole bark could be used for a relatively durable roofing and served as waterproof covering (Johnson 1997). Cedar inner bark had innumerable uses for clothing, basketry, mat making, and lashing (LaForet 1984; Stewart 1984). When bark is removed from a cedar tree, the wood dies in the area that is uncovered, allowing the use of dendrochronology to age the regrowth lobe (Mobley and Eldridge 1992). Spatial and temporal information about bark use may be recoverable by considering the context of bark use and employing survey techniques coupled with dendrochronology and measurement of scars. Studies of this sort have been carried out on Meares Island and other locations in Coastal British Columbia (Arcas Associates 1984) and in Northern Sweden, where spatial and temporal patterning of Saami use of edible inner bark of Scots Pine around Lake S\u00e4dvajaure was studied (Niklasson et al. 1994). In the North, including the Mackenzie Delta region (Andre and Fehr 2001) and the Yakutat Bay area in Alaska (De Laguna 1972), spruce bark was used to make smoke houses and shelters. Use of spruce bark for canoes is also documented ethnographically for Athapaskans of the B.C. Interior (Gottesfeld 1994) and for Dogrib, Mountain, and Slavey peoples of the subarctic Mackenzie (Industry Canada n.d.). As trees are relatively small, harvest of spruce bark for these purposes typically involved girdling (and thus killing) the tree. Girdled trees also provided firewood, as girdled trees dry where they stand and can be cut down for fuel when needed. Except in the Coastal Zone, birch bark is the most important bark for technological use in the region. Birch bark is used from central British Columbia 12: Tools for Interpreting Past Plant Use \u0018\u0018\u0018 a b Figure 12.1.

It is also widely used in mainland Alaska (Kari 1987). Birch bark can be used for containers, wrapping food, in pit cooking, and for canoes (Andrews and Zoe 1998). Its burning properties also make it a valued fire starter, and Gitksan used it for torches (\u201cGit an Maaxs,\u201d a village name, means people of the birch bark torches and alludes to an oral history that involves fishing by torchlight). Unlike harvest of other types of barks, birch bark collection does not normally allow aging by dendrochronological techniques. However, the birch tree continues to increase in girth, and the exposed inner bark undergoes a series of changes in appearance, allowing a rough estimation of the time of bark collection (Figure 12.2). A freshly peeled tree will have fresh, uncheckered orange inner bark exposed. After some time, the exposed inner bark darkens to nearly black and exhibits a fine, checkered texture caused by growth in girth of the tree. After decades, this dark inner bark fades to a chalky grey colour, and the \u201ccheckers\u201d grow large and irregular. The marking on the bark can remain even after the tree has died and only a cylinder of bark remains around the now rotten trunk wood. This would indicate very old birch collection (perhaps >100 years on the Skeena River). Evidence of medicinal bark use. More rarely, one may encounter evidence of bark stripping for medicinal purposes. Here ethnographic data are important in deducing the use. Balsam or subalpine fir bark (Abies lasiocarpa) has no technological uses but is widely collected for medicine. Spruce bark can also be stripped for medicinal preparations; I have observed both Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en and Slavey (at Great Bear Lake) stripping bark from a young spruce (or \u201cgreen tree\u201d) for medicine. This procedure involves young trees, which are not usually girdled standing, though they may be cut down and stripped. Bark collection for food. The edible inner bark or \u201ccambium\u201d of lodgepole pine has been a frequently collected seasonal food and a welcome source of sugars in the spring season. Cambium collection has a very short season, less than three weeks at any given site, during which the digestibility of the newly formed cambium and inner bark is high, sugar content is high, and resin content very low (Gottesfeld 1995; Johnson 1997). Trees scarred by pine cambium collection show cut marks at the top of the rectangular or elongated scar at a height convenient to the harvester and may show branch stubs removed by axe. Dendrochronology of the regrowth lobe can date the harvest year (Niklasson et al. 1994; cf. Swetnam 1984). Specific bone, antler, or wooden tools for collect\u0018\u0018\u0018 Leslie Main Johnson a b Figure 12.2. Relative ages of birch bark collection scars. a. stage 1 fresh birch bark collection scar, less than five years old Kispiox Valley, B.C.

Photographed 1989. c 12: Tools for Interpreting Past Plant Use \u0018\u0018\u0018 ing edible inner bark resources had distinctive shapes depending on the species harvested. As the edible tissue sticks to the wood rather than bark in the case of lodgepole pine, the tools may exhibit a concave curvature to match the shape of the trunk (Morice 1892\u201393:Figures 64 and 65) while harvest of hemlock inner bark requires a convex tool as it adheres to the removed bark strips (Johnson 1997:Figure 4\u20133). On the northwest coast and extending up the Skeena River, western hemlock provided an important seasonal food resource, collected in large quantities in season, processed by pounding and pit cooking before drying into molded cakes, which could be stored indefinitely, and which were an important trade item (Boas 1916; Gottesfeld 1992; People of Ksan 1980). Mature trees might be girdled, or more recently, felled and stripped to maximize the amount of edible bark xsu\u2019uu. The Tsimshian had a special tool for gauging the thickness of hemlock cambium to ensure that an adequate thickness of harvestable inner bark was present to warrant harvesting (sketch by George MacDonald figured in Eldridge 1982). Evidence at a hemlock processing camp could include remains of wooden mortars to pound the cambium, cooking pits, or drying racks or molds for cambium cakes. Other species harvested for cambium, such as aspen and black cottonwood, appear to leave infrequent evidence of past use. Evidence on the Land In the subarctic, remains of former camps, frames for working hides, sweathouse pits, or ancient wooden fish traps can be encountered on the land. As wood rots slowly in the cold and relatively dry climate, old wooden items can be found in situ on the surface, including the remains of brush houses (Hare and Greer 1994); such shelters were made by Tutchone, Tahltan (Emmons 1911), and Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en (Morice 1892\u201393; Gottesfeld 1994). Remains of a variety of deadfall traps and cut stumps of varying ages may also be encountered (Emmons 1911; Morice 1892\u201393). In Gitksan and Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory, harvest of black huckleberry was an integral part of the season round, and berry camps were established on the land near or within named, owned, and managed berry patches (Johnson 1997; Trusler and Johnson 2008). Berry camps may be recognized, even where vegetation succession has occurred, by remains of implements \u0018\u00180 Leslie Main Johnson used in berry processing such as berry drying racks or large bentwood boxes at the site (Trusler 2002; Trusler and Johnson 2008). Anomalies in plant distribution. Certain plants have unusual ranges that appear to be correlated with anthropogenic environments or travel corridors. Rice root lily [Fritillaria camschatcensis] is common on the coast, and its bulbs are a widely used carbohydrate source (Kuhnlein and Turner 1991). Along the Skeena River corridor, the lily is found far upriver, especially in areas burned for garden sites and in the fields surrounding village sites (Johnson 1999). Pacific crabapple (Malus fuscus) shows a similar anomalous distribution. It is frequent near habitation sites and camps along the coast. Ken Downs has located stands that appear to be orchards in Kalum Canyon, an ancient Tsimshian habitation site about 90 kilometres from the coast which was abandoned about a hundred years ago (Downs 2006). McDonald (2005) has documented Tsimshian accounts of transplanting crabapple and hazelnut, and tending riceroot lily from Kitsumkalum elders. Crabapple is also sporadically present farther up the Skeena River along major indigenous travel corridors in certain sites in the Kispiox Valley and along the Telegraph Trail to Kuldo (Galdo\u2019o) on the upper Skeena, where a traditional place name, Milkst \u2018crabapple,\u2019 records its presence (Jeff Harris Sr., personal communication 1987; Ralph Michell, personal communication 2005). Evidence from Archaeological Contexts Evidence from wet sites. Remarkable insights into ancient plant use have come from a handful of sites with waterlogged soils, which can preserve plant remains for long periods of time. Croes (2001), MacDonald and Cybulski (2001), and Fladmark (1986) give good reviews of wet sites and recovered plant artefacts on the North Coast. These sites demonstrate lengthy cultural continuity in the region (\u00b16,000 years), as well as ancient cultural diversity, and suggest that extrapolation from ethnographic data is likely to be useful. Potential of analysis of microfossils and macrofossils. Another strand of evidence of plant use from sites is archaeobotanical analysis. Lepofsky et al. (2001) lament the paucity of palaeoethnobotanical studies in northwestern North America and call attention to the potential range of information such studies can provide. They describe and analyze an archaeobotanical assemblage of 12: Tools for Interpreting Past Plant Use \u0018\u0018\u0018 human-transported plant remains in a rock shelter shell-midden deposit on a small island west of Prince of Wales Island, in an area settled historically by Tlingit and then Haida. Archaeobotanical evidence suggests that the shelter was occupied during the spring and summer months. Among the surprises that this investigation revealed was the use of Armeria maritima, an edible plant not reported to be used locally in the ethnographic literature, and the use of Douglas fir wood for fuel, apparently recovered from driftwood transported north from its natural limit at latitude 53\u00b0. A problem noted by Lepofsky et al. (2001) is the paucity of reference materials of tissues such as roots for comparison of archaeobotanical SEMs. McAndrews and Fecteau (1989) studied a dry non-coastal site in the Skeena River drainage in conjunction with the excavation of the historic Kitwanga Fort, well recorded in local Gitksan oral histories. They report a number of taxa present in screened soil samples from house interiors and hearths and within the palisade, including charred and uncharred seeds of a variety of berries and fruits known to have been used by the Gitksan. Other seeds present represent herbaceous weedy taxa, windblown tree seeds, and a few dogwood seeds (Cornus sp.). If the dogwood seeds represent bunchberry Cornus canadensis, this would be another edible berry species reported ethnographically (Johnson 1997; People of Ksan 1980). Pollen analysis indicates a vegetative environment largely similar to the present area. Some of the reported spore types may be from economic plants; Dryopteris-type fern spores were present, which could possibly indicate use of the carbohydrate-rich rhizomes as food (cf. Turner et al. 1992), while sphagnum spores might represent moss used for diapering babies and for menstrual needs (Johnson-Gottesfeld and Vitt 1996) as it is unlikely to have been part of the local site vegetation. Zutter\u2019s (2000) work on a house site in Labrador in the eastern Canadian subarctic also suggests the potential of archaeobotany to add detail to the archaeological record of plant uses; evidence of spruce bough flooring was particularly interesting and consistent with ethnographic data. In a more southerly study, Lepofsky et al. (1996) also found remains of conifer bough floor covering in a pit house in Keatly Creek, B.C. These studies support the potential of palaeoethnobotanical analysis to augment the information collected through other forms of archaeological analysis. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Leslie Main Johnson Evidence from Ice Fields and Glaciers The remarkable artefacts being recovered from melting ice fields and glaciers in the mountainous region of the southwestern Yukon and adjacent British Columbia give an unexpected window on activities of people in that region dating back to around 8,000 BP in some sites (Hare et al. 2004). Perishable materials of both plant and animal origin are melting out of retreating icefields, which have been present for more than 4,000 years (Kuzyk et al. 1998; Hare et al. 2004; Farnell et al. 2004). The oldest artefact yet recovered, a dart shaft, dates to 8,360 BP (Hare et al. 2004). This ecological zone was extensively used for hunting caribou (as it still is to the east near the NWT border, and to the north along the Dempster corridor in the northern Yukon). Materials recovered from ice fields include a variety of wooden artefacts, such as dart shafts and arrow shafts, and allow the shift in technology from atlatl to bow and arrow in the area to be dated (Hare et al. 2004). Though the types of plant remains thus far recovered are relatively few, the direct evidence of the form and nature of wooden dart and arrow shafts, including the lashing and fletching, extends back thousands of years and helps to refine interpretations of the purposes of various points. The species of woods used are not reported in the articles I have reviewed but should be determinable in such well-preserved material. The spectacular find of Kwaday D\u00e4n Ts\u2019\u00ecnch\u00ed, \u2018Long Ago Person Found,\u2019 the young man who died in a glacier crevasse about AD 1450, allows yet further insight into use of plants and animals (Dickson et al. 2004; Mudie et al. 2005). The man wore a coastal-style spruce root hat, consistent with what one might have expected of a traveller coming from the rainy coast, though his fur robe was of interior Athapaskan style, attesting to trade and probably kin relations across the mountains (cf. Cruikshank 2005). The surprise, however, was the large amount of Salicornia pollen in his intestinal tract, suggesting a meal of glasswort or samphire picked on the coast (Mudie et al. 2005), a finding not predicted by extrapolation backward from ethnographic records of plant use in the region. As glaciers and ice fields continue to melt in the region, further spectacular finds are likely which will yield a great amount of information if they can be recovered and studied before they begin to deteriorate. 12: Tools for Interpreting Past Plant Use \u0018\u0018\u0018 Putting the Evidence Together Interpreting evidence of past plant use requires bringing together a number of threads of evidence. The evidence from contemporary ethnobotany and ethnographic and ethnohistoric evidence provides a rich lens of interpretation of evidence on the land, from sites and from palaeoenvironmental data, but must be used with a degree of circumspection, as the unexpected findings from Kwaday D\u00e4n Ts\u2019\u00ecnch\u00ed and other archaeobotanical contexts remind us. In this paper I have reviewed a number of kinds of evidence of past plant use, concentrating on evidence on the land, which records evidence of the recent past but which also gives a sense of the spatial and sometimes seasonal patterning of use, and on the relatively rare plant remains from archaeological contexts. Wet sites have offered remarkable insights into past plant use, especially for technology, and have allowed interpretations both of contemporaneous cultural diversity and of noteworthy cultural continuity, belying the evidence of discontinuity or change from the lithic evidence. Archaeobotany also offers significant possibilities in northwest coast and subarctic and arctic sites, as Zutter (2000) has demonstrated from Labrador and Lepofsky et al. (2001) demonstrated from the Prince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska, both confirming what one would expect to find (e.g., spruce boughs covering living floors) and surprising us with unexpected evidence such as the previously unreported use of Armeria maritima. Extending evidence of past plant use by looking for distinctive residue signatures, perhaps on suspected cooking or sweatlodge rocks, for example, remains to be attempted. The last, and rather spectacular archaeological strand of evidence for past plant use comprises the remarkable preserved organics from the Yukon ice patches, and the rarer remains from glaciers, which allow recovery of datable wooden and other plant-related artefacts from alpine hunting areas and from trans-mountain travel corridors. The artefacts recovered with Kwaday D\u00e4n Ts\u2019\u00ecnch\u00ed (his spruce root hat) and the analysis of his gut contents provided remarkable evidence of plant use and both continuity with and distinction from recorded ethnographic and ethnohistoric evidence. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Leslie Main Johnson Acknowledgments: I would like to thank the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, the Canadian Circumpolar Institute, the Gwich\u2019in Renewable Resource Board, and the Athabasca Research Fund for research support; my local teachers and elders; my local collaborators; my patient colleagues; and Ken Downs, and Darlene Vegh for use of photographs, and Lisa Mutch for review of a draft of this manuscript.

Brady Abstract. Site-based scales of analysis are often the dominant units of archaeological inquiry. Difficulty arises when a small number of sites are used to interpret mobile hunter-gatherer land use across a region.

Located between the Sierra Nevada mountains to the west and the Rocky Mountains in the east, the Great Basin is predominated by sagebrush scrub habitat, interspersed with more than thirty-three mountain ranges, and scattered internally draining rivers, lakes, and marshes (Grayson 1993:11\u201323). As an arid region, the presence of water is often seen as an important factor affecting human settlement and may also be viewed as a proxy for general environmental productivity. Earlier archaeological research focusing on the central-western Great Basin had put forth two opposing models of settlement organization relative to wetland habitats. These have come to be known as the \u201climnosedentary\u201d and \u201climnomobile\u201d hypotheses (e.g., Thomas 1985:19\u201320). The first proposes that wetlands were such productive habitats relative to the surrounding environment that hunter-gatherers would map onto these resources for periods of time, potentially throughout the year. Alternatively, the limnomobile hypothesis argues that Great Basin wetlands were not productive enough to support sedentary populations. In the face of archaeological variability, these views have proven overly simplistic (Bettinger 1993:45; Madsen 2002). Further research argues that one must also consider factors relating to gendered work differentiation and central place foraging (Zeanah 1996) in addition to population mobility and the viability of other foraging options when considering the importance of a given habitat for hunter-gatherer groups (Kelly 2001). As such, the factors affecting Great Basin wetland use still have much to be learned. The present research investigates how variable wetland habitats were used within a single region. Research Context The Mono Lake basin, located east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the western extent of the North American Great Basin is a unique setting to test propositions about the aboriginal importance of wetlands (Figure 13.1). The basin itself is large, covering more than 650 km2 (Stine 1987:14). Peaks in the \u00180\u0018 Ryan T. Br ady west exceed 3,900 m asl, yet are considerably lower around the other basin margins. In the central-western portion of the basin is Mono Lake, a large, hypersaline lake that is inhospitable for fish. Instead, aquatic resources are restricted to brine shrimp, and pupae of the brine fly that develop in the lake\u2019s waters (National Academy of Sciences [NAS] 1987:13\u201314). Lake elevation is presently 1,945 m asl, although it undergoes natural fluctuations due to changes in the rate of evaporation and water inflow. In the past 3,500 years, lake elevation has ranged between 1,940 m and 1,981 m asl (Stine 1990). This range frames much of the time period in question. Ethnographically, the Mono Basin was inhabited by the Kutzadika\u2019a Paiute. The Kutzadika\u2019a appear to have practised a fission-fusion settlement pattern typical of many Great Basin groups. Although generally residing in the Basin year-round, individuals and families were known to come and go as they pleased depending on seasonal resource availability or other social obligations (Davis 1965:15\u201316). The ethnographically described annual subsistence round depicts Mono Lake basin\u2019s inhabitants making seasonal use of the wetlands where in the spring and early summer they would move down to the wet meadows and marshes on the western portion of the lake to gather roots, greens, and seeds (Davis 1965:29\u201336). Populations would disperse in the summer, and autumn was often spent collecting pine nuts in the mountains fringing the basin. The Kutzadika\u2019a generally lived off stored resources throughout the winter (Davis 1964, 1965). Physical geography affects the resource structure of the Mono Basin. Most water entering the Basin does so in the form of snowmelt flowing to the western shore of Mono Lake through five main riparian corridors. Due to the rainshadow effect of storms passing over the Sierra Nevada, precipitation falling in the eastern Basin is meagre at 14 cm, compared to 38.5 cm in the west (Stine 1987:16). Other sources of freshwater entering the lake are through slope runoff and artesian and groundwater springs. Type of water inflow, in addition to slope and sediment leaching create variable wetland habitats that fringe the lake (Jones & Stokes Associates 1993; NAS 1987; Stine 1993). Based on these characteristics as well as vegetation distributions, wetlands have been grouped into three different types: freshwater, brackish, and saline. Of these habitats, freshwater wetlands in the west contain a greater diversity and density of plant and animal resources for people to exploit (Constantine 1993; NAS 1987:Figure 5.5). Vegetation in the eastern saline habitats 13: Variable Wetland Use at the Mono Lake Basin \u00180\u0018 \u00180\u0018 Ryan T. Br ady Figure 13.1. Map of the Mono Lake basin with wetland habitats and surveyed quads. is more sparse, comprised mainly of salt-tolerant plants such as greasewood and saltgrass. They attract fewer animals and are viewed as low ranked relative to the other wetland types. Brackish wetlands, on the northern and southern shores, fall somewhere between these two, containing a mixture of environmental characteristics that may fluctuate more readily than freshwater or saline wetlands. Foraging theory predicts that hunter-gatherers will exploit resources that provide the highest caloric return for the effort invested in procurement and processing (Kelly 1995:83). As highly ranked foods become depleted, people will either travel to other areas where those resources can be obtained or include lower ranked resources in the diet that provide fewer calories for the effort invested. Importance of a given resource may be related not only to intrinsic properties of energetic returns but also to ease of capture, size, and density of a given resource patch, among other factors (Bettinger 1991:84). Generally, large game such as mule deer or bighorn sheep are viewed as high ranked, while plant resources like rice and salt grass are lower ranked. Predominant questions driving the present research are: how did huntergatherers in the Mono Basin use the varied wetland habitats? Were some wetland types ignored while others were more intensively used? How were the wetlands exploited, through residential \u201cmapping on,\u201d logistical mobility, or from within a daily foraging radius of the residential base? These questions are used to understand how different Great Basin wetlands provided for huntergatherer populations over a long or short-term basis. Initial predictions were that freshwater wetlands would exhibit the greatest diversity of artefacts and represent the most intensive use through time due to increased environmental productivity. Likewise, the decreased productivity and diversity of saline habitats may result in them being used predominantly in more recent times for short periods, when regional populations are believed to have had a more expanded diet breadth (Bettinger 1999:41; Carpenter 2001:12\u201313). 13: Variable Wetland Use at the Mono Lake Basin \u00180\u0018 Methods To investigate differential use of the wetlands, it was necessary to sample multiple areas and pertinent elevation zones around the Basin. To achieve this goal, a non-site approach to surface survey was undertaken to collect data from the different wetland habitats. Proponents of what is often termed non-site (Dunnell 1992; Thomas 1975), off-site (Foley 1981), or distributional archaeology (Ebert 1992) argue that the sites are often the result of a palimpsest of archaeological accumulations, resulting from multiple, often unrelated activities. They contend that site-based records are too mixed to be able to interpret on their own. Rather, surface artefact distributions across large landscapes should be studied to identify patterns of tool use and discard at multiple scales and across regions. The present study focuses on the distribution of artefacts across the landscape without biasing the data set toward large artefact accumulations at the expense of overlooking smaller ones. Forty 500 m x 500 m survey units were selected from a stratified sample of 461 that covered the extent of the delineated wetland habitats from the current lake elevation up to 2,025 m asl (Figure 13.1). This sample covers the extent of lake fluctuations over the past 3,500 years and also provides a 30 m elevation buffer zone to include potential activity areas related to the lake\u2019s high stand. These lands were also likely exposed in earlier times. Survey transects were spaced 25 m apart with each surveyor plotting the location of debitage and other artefacts on an aerial photograph of the unit. The photo had each transect overlaid and broken into 100 m intervals. By this, surveyors could keep track of their location through pacing and physical landmarks. Flaked stone artefacts were collected, and ground stone artefacts recorded in the field. Finally, a 100 m x 100 m quad in the southwest corner was surveyed at 10 m transect intervals. Here, in addition to the standard survey methods, debitage was also collected. This sample was limited to 30 flakes in areas with dense accumulations. Of the 40 units surveyed (6 freshwater, 15 brackish, 19 saline), only two were completely empty, 15 contained only lithic debitage, and one had a single millingstone. The remaining units contained combinations of flaked and ground stone tools as well as lithic debitage, with one quarter of the units surveyed (n = 10) containing debitage, formed flaked, and ground stone artefacts. No intact features such as rock rings were identified in the survey. \u00180\u0018 Ryan T. Br ady Analysis Initial predictions about the varied intensity of land use by wetland were supported with 20 tools per km 2 surveyed recovered in the freshwater habitat, yet only 11 and 7 tools per km 2 in the brackish and saline wetlands respectively. Eleven tool classes were identified, and due to the large geographic area covered, there is some variability in material distributions (Table 13.1). For example, the southwestern area is near a naturally occurring obsidian source. Some quadrats here contained obsidian raw material in the alluvium and are associated with dense distributions of obsidian debitage and assayed cobbles that were tested during obsidian procurement. Cores were also recovered in these areas of raw material acquisition and are absent from other contexts. Overlap with the residues of resource procurement, processing, and tool maintenance requires that these remain in the total sample, but one must keep in mind that some variation observed may be driven by these outliers.

Using the tool distributions, a significant chi square statistic (X 2 = 52.50; df = 20; p < .001) along with adjusted residuals identifies sources of variation between the samples. Here, values greater than 1.96 or less than \u20131.96 highlight tool classes that are over- or under-represented ( = .05) relative to the overall sample, while those falling between those ranges are viewed as normally distributed or null (Table 13.1). As can be seen by Table 13.2A, there is much similarity in tool representation across wetland class with flake tools, handstones, millingstones, and miscellaneous ground stone distributed normally across the three wetland classes. Projectile points are absent from the freshwater area, implying an absence of hunting related activities. \u00180\u0018 Ryan T. Br ady A One item that stands out as signifying a different strategy of land use is the over-representation of bifaces in saline habitats. While these are common in the other two regions, bifaces have been argued to signify a different mode of technological organization (Kelly 1988). Bifaces may be preferred items to bring to areas where toolstone availability is either unknown or lacking. These tools are argued to be easily transportable cores that can provide flakes for expedient cutting activities, in addition to being reliable tools used for a variety of cutting or scraping functions. Prevalence of bifaces in the saline habitats suggest a region of greater risk where people were travelling away from their residential bases and stores of toolstone but wanted to be sure to have enough material for necessary activities while on short-term forays. Further support for the use of bifaces over other technologies in saline habitats comes from debitage analysis (Table 13.2B). Using only technologically identifiable debitage, there is a general distribution of flake types across the freshwater and brackish habitats with bifacial reduction debris being underrepresented in the freshwater wetlands (X 2 = 13.70; df = 4; p < .01). In contrast, saline habitats have a prevalence of bifacial flaking debris, while core reduction flakes are uncommon, and decortication debris occurs at a null value. The abundance of bifacial reduction flakes and sparse amount of core reduction debris note greater use of bifaces in the saline habitats. These analyses suggest that there is some variability in land use strategy across wetland types, yet not much difference in the general activities conducted in the habitats. If subsistence- and settlement-related activities occurred in relatively similar distributions across wetland types, how are these activities represented when considering general geographic areas within the basin? Similar to the previous examples, tools were grouped by class and location within the basin. A significant chi square value and adjusted residuals provide the information to study tool distributions by quadrant within the Basin (X 2 = 90.73; df = 30; p < .001). One pattern of note is the over-representation of flake tools and millingstones in the northwest, and handstones in the northeast (Table 13.3A). Prevalence of milling gear implies importance of plant-processing activities in the northern areas. That the two tool classes are in unequal distribution, one in the northwest, and the other in the northeast, may signify a pattern of mobility between patches, such as handstones being portable, with millingstones often left at processing areas. In fact, of the fifteen units that contained ground stone, nearly three-quarters (n = 11; 73.3%) of them included either handstones or 13: Variable Wetland Use at the Mono Lake Basin \u00180\u0018 Table 13.3.

Reduc. = biface reduction; Decort. = decortication. millingstones, but not both. Also of note is the paucity of these tools in the southwestern area, but rather a prominence of bedrock mortars, demonstrating a different technology used to process plants or other materials. Ground stone distributions by quadrant demonstrate a degree of mobility in the north with seed-grinding activities generally occurring at disparate places, potentially away from the residential base. Some items were likely portable \u0018\u00180 Ryan T. Br ady while others were cached. Additionally, the southwest area appears to have had a different technological focus with the presence of bedrock mortars. The variation likely represents the outcome of problem-solving strategies related to landscape topography and water flow. The southwestern area contains two large streams that enter the lake through relatively steep topography. These do not create as much near-shore wet meadow or marsh habitat as there is in the northwest, where lower slope gradients slow stream flow, dispersing water across the alluvial fan. Additionally there are seasonal streams that flow to the lake from the north, creating diverse mosaics of resources that may have been best targeted at different times of the year. This affects the seasonality and residential stability afforded by each area. One further question about the tool distributions is how are they arranged by elevation? Although Mono Lake undergoes natural fluctuations in elevation, this inquiry can still be informative about activities as they compare in general proximity to the lake. Tools were grouped into four elevation increments, and the distributions analyzed in the fashion as earlier examples (X 2 = 69.33; d.f. = 30; p < .001). Handstones appear at null frequencies in all four elevation classes, and millingstones are null in the lower three elevations (Table 13.2B). Also of note is the changing presence of projectile points, bifaces, and flake tools. These are all over-represented in the lowest stratum, then null in the next, and have a fluctuating presence in the final two strata. That ground and flaked stone tools have different patterns of abundance suggest that these two tool classes were used at different levels of intensity as the lake fluctuated or as diet breadth or settlement patterns changed. Conclusions Results of the current effort present important information regarding land use in an environment containing varied wetland habitats. Initially, these were segregated into three classes: freshwater, brackish, and saline. Although distributed across the wetland habitats, tool distributions did demonstrate varied use across wetland type and geographic area (Figure 13.2). There is an increased presence of bifaces and bifacial flaking debris in the saline habitat relative to the other wetlands, suggesting more short-term use of the wetland class. 13: Variable Wetland Use at the Mono Lake Basin \u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ryan T. Br ady Figure 13.2. Important Artifact distributions in the Mono Lake basin. There is a different pattern of variability in artefact distributions when tools are grouped by basin quadrant. The northern half appears to have an important role for seed-grinding tools; however, handstones and millingstones do not often co-occur, implying mobility between resource patches and differential portability of the tools. These create discrepancies in tool discard and caching locations. In contrast, bedrock mortars are more prominent in the southwest, likely due to the exploitation of other resources and possibly more long-term habitation. Finally, tool distributions relative to elevation demonstrate an over-representation of flaked stone tools in the lowest elevation strata, decreasing and fluctuating at higher elevations. In contrast, the distribution of milling gear is more evenly spread across elevation, suggesting stability in the use of these tools. Relating these data to the discussion of whether Great Basin wetlands served as rich or poor resource patches, it is evident that one must consider, not just the intrinsic properties of the resource, but also the settlement and mobility patterns. By grouping use areas around Mono Lake by varied characteristics, it is apparent that the wetland habitats were used differently. The temporal extent or continuity of these patterns may be answered with other data. Results of the present study indicate that the strategies in which Mono Lake\u2019s wetlands were used varied considerably. Their use must be viewed in the context of regional settlement and subsistence practices. Investigating tool distributions across a landscape is a powerful tool to identify varied settlement, subsistence, and mobility patterns.

As previous major studies have demonstrated, Geographic Information Systems provide archaeological research with powerful analytical capabilities as well as ease of data creation and management, nearly infinite scalability, and compatibility with various external data and modules. However, archaeological (or reliable) geographical data management or related infrastructures and thus do not have enough data sources to achieve the research aims. Archaeologists are almost always required to produce their own maps within budgetary restrictions. Thus, in reality, even digital map making is not an easy task and does not make the digital mapping at the archaeological site of Pachacamac on the Peruvian Central (1) selection of the most efficient way to achieve immediate goals on the basis of a researches tend to occur in the regions that have not yet established an efficient desired progress, to say nothing of expected analytical endeavour.

These earlier GIS studies were all premised on ready-made digital maps at hand and failed to discuss mapping procedures in detail. Coupled with practical problems discussed below, however, making digital maps is not an easy task. Although it is obvious that GIS hold some promise for archaeological research, I argue that its appropriateness and efficacy for our discipline needs to be more fully assessed. In so doing, digital site mapping, I believe, is worth focusing our attention on at this time. Given ample funds, it would be feasible to map in great detail the whole area of interest using the most advanced digital survey equipment. However, in reality, this is not the case for most of us. Constraints such as tight budget and consequent limited resources will always complicate the situation and often lead our colleagues to suffer from \u201cGIS-phobia.\u201d Furthermore, ethnographic and archaeological research tend to occur in the regions that have not yet established an efficient (or reliable) geographical data management or related infrastructures and thus do not have enough data sources to achieve our goals. It is not until we overcome a series of practical problems that the time efficiency and succinctness of GIS-based digital mapping and related data management will be gained. The main objective of this paper is to highlight a notable gap between theory and reality and how such a gap may be filled in. As a case study, I will refer to my digital site mapping of Pachacamac, which is a part of the ongoing long-term archaeological project on the central coast of Peru, the Pachacamac Archaeological Project (PAP), directed by Izumi Shimada (Southern Illinois University at Carbondale). PAP has a clear vision for data creation and storage in both digital and analog formats. Following this vision, I worked during the \u0018\u0018\u0018 Go Matsumoto spring of 2004 to create a digital map of the site and took part in the excavation in the subsequent summer to collect field data for the corrections and further refinements to the map. Settings The site of Pachacamac is located approximately thirty kilometres southeast of Lima on a plateau on the north bank of the Lur\u00edn River and approximately one kilometre inland from its mouth. The plateau looks onto the river mouth, the Pacific Ocean, and a cluster of small islands offshore. While the full extent of the site still remains unknown, the site occupies an area of approximately 5.2 square kilometres (Matsumoto 2005). Three massive roughly concentric walls partition the area into four major sectors, I through IV, extending from southeast to northwest. The site is thought to have been one of the most powerful religious centres in pre-Hispanic Peru for over a thousand years or at least from the time of Late Lima occupation (Uhle 1991 [1903]). Mapping Techniques and Procedures Currently available techniques of GIS-based site mapping can be broadly divided into two types: (1) small-scale mapping methods relying primarily on remote sensing data and techniques; and (2) large-scale mapping methods based on location surveys in the field.1 Both require their own hardware and software, and the capability of the equipment and/or the reliability of data sources one selects will directly reflect the quality of final products. PAP adopted the former methods. If one needs to cover a large area even at the expense of precision, the former approach would be recommended. Its relatively light workload does not cost too much to execute. The methods that we employed for our site mapping were relatively handy and thus may be more appropriate for preliminary survey or reconnaissance prior to the fieldwork. For the latter approach, on the other hand, there is no choice but to slowly build up the map by taking measurements in the field. You should choose this approach only in cases where you need a very precise map and are prepared to conduct location surveys with perseverance. 14: Making a GIS-Based Digital Map of Pachacamac \u0018\u0018\u0018 In Pachacamac, there is another ongoing archaeological project, the Ychsma Project, directed by Peter Eeckhout (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles). This project represents a notable contrast to our mapping and employs large-scale mapping techniques based on meticulous location surveys by means of a laser total station in order to represent the architectural features in three dimensions (Ychsma Project 2005). Their heavy workload would be fathomable from the fact that their mapping project inaugurated in 2002 was not expected to be completed until 2007. As shown in this contrast, archaeologists in the United States tend to be compelled to individually and annually or biannually seek their research funds, whereas their colleagues in Europe and other regions of the world have relatively easier access to multi-year funding. Thus, many of the multidisciplinary research projects that implement digital site mapping and related technical examinations are based in European institutions with greater long-term stability and personnel support (cf. Bard et al. 2003; Campana and Francovich 2003; Cavalli et al. 2003; Johnson 2005; Lambers 2004). Given the difference, important future developments in the archaeological application of GIS are more likely to come out of major European projects. Our digital mapping consists of three broad phases: (1) prototype map preparation based on the resources available prior to the fieldwork in the summer of 2004; (2) ground-truth checking of the archaeological structures and Ground Control Point measurements by means of Real-Time Kinematic Differential GPS2 (RTK DGPS) of the highest accuracy; and (3) data post-processing and consummation of the map (Figures 14.1 and 14.2). This stepwise approach dovetails the basic design of GIS sub-systems, which allows separate data manipulation and display. Because any quest for perfection cannot be readily accomplished, we should make efforts to set up and achieve a sequence of midterm goals, depending upon the resources available. With budgetary restrictions and an optimistic assumption that we could blend productively the conventional data sources and digital photogrammetry techniques, we chose to begin with a combination of traditional 1:5,000-scale topography maps and old film aerial photographs taken in 1957 (Figures 14.3a,b). Instead of conducting location survey on the ground, we planned to put those data in a GIS overlay and digitize archaeological structures and other topographic features on them. Because photographs in general suffer from various systematic and nonsystematic errors, to be used as planimetrically true \u0018\u00180 Go Matsumoto Figure 14.1. The workflow of prototype map creation (Phase I). 14: Making a GIS-Based Digital Map of Pachacamac \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 14.2. The workflow of post-fieldwork data processing (Phase III). \u0018\u0018\u0018 Go Matsumoto orthoimages, they need to be transformed from a perspective projection to a scaled orthographic projection in combination with the correction processes of various geometric errors. The success and failure of my site mapping primarily depended upon the success of this process. However, I confronted serious problems that defied a quick and simple solution. As a result, I had to be very inventive to resolve them. Below I discuss these problems. Pr actical Problems Most of the problems emerged in the forementioned transformation process that is called \u201cblock triangulation.\u201d The block triangulation basically requires four sets of data: (1) a stereopair of aerial photographs; (2) a minimum of three known Ground Control Points; (3) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or Digital Terrain Model3 (DTM); and (4) camera calibration report. Strictly speaking, however, none of them could be obtained in the form that we wished from the Servicio Aerofotogr\u00e1fico Nacional (SAN) or the Instituto Geomilitar. This difficulty stems mainly from the defectiveness and scarcity of data resources in Peru. 1: Pseudo-stereopair The producer of the aerial photographs that I used confidently claimed that they were a stereopair (Figures 14.3a,b), but they were not. A stereoscopic parallax requires the photographs to be acquired at exposure stations from one or two flight lines at the same altitude on the same side of the terrain feature usually with 55 to 65 per cent overlap between them (Lillesand et al. 2004:131). The orientation of the images and states of exposure led me to conclude that our photographs were most likely taken from different sides and at different times. The overlap between them is no more than 51.3 per cent. The only solution to this problem is simply to process this pseudo-stereopair as a true stereopair since the processing software will not make any query about its validity. Of course, however, we should keep in mind that the resultant orthoimages may be problematic to some extent. 14: Making a GIS-Based Digital Map of Pachacamac \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 14.3. a.

The GCPs should contain X, Y, and Z coordinates, and a minimum of three should be evenly distributed throughout the study area and clearly identifiable on the aerial photographs. Alternatively, I collected X and Y coordinates from the georeferenced topography map that I created by clicking the points at which I wished to place the GCPs. In the same manner, Z coordinates were extracted from a DEM of 90-by-90 m spatial resolution derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission4 (SRTM) arc-3 interferometric radar data available on the web for free. 3: DEM of very low spatial resolution In order to properly eliminate the spatial discrepancies caused by terrain relief, elevation information such as DTM, DEM, and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) is required to be integrated during the correction process. Because we could not afford to purchase expensive high-resolution DEM or DTM, the SRTM arc-3 DEM was again used for this purpose. However, as might be expected, topographic prominences within each 90-by-90 m cell cannot be depicted and rather are represented as a smooth surface, which means that it is not suitable for large-scale detailed contextual analysis. 4: Incomplete and/or incorrect camera report A regular camera calibration certificate was not available for the aerial photos we purchased. A replacement document provided by the producer of the photographs contains only: (1) project number, (2) picture numbers, (3) date of shooting, (4) scale, (5) airplane altitude, and (6) focal length. It is lacking critical information for the triangulation process such as principal point, fiducial marks, and rotation angles. Furthermore, the document is not only incomplete, but also evidently inaccurate. The altitude of 50 m, for instance, is apparently hard to accept if you take into account that each photograph covers the ground area of about 2,300 x 2,300 m. Supposing the scale (1:10,000) and focal length (152.67 mm) stated in the document are true, the altitude should be about 465 m. The content of the document is internally inconsistent. This problem was partially solved by consulting the data strip shown on the margin of the photograph. The data strip confirms that the focal length is \u0018\u0018\u0018 Go Matsumoto 152.67 mm as stated in the document but concurrently indicates that the altitude at the time of exposure was 1,600 m rather than either 50 or 465 m. This value sounds quite reasonable for the forementioned ground area. According to the information of the data strip, the scale will be 1:10,480. Without the film coordinates of the principal point of each photograph, I had no choice but to define them as (0, 0) assuming that the principal point was placed completely in the centre of the photo image with absolutely no displacement. The film coordinates of fiducial marks also had to be replaced with theoretical values. The producer\u2019s website states that they have been using 9-inch Wild-type film cameras such as Leica RC series. According to the FAQ of the Environmental Systems Research Institute Japan\u2019s website (ESRI Japan 2002), moreover, approximate values of 106 and \u2013106 can be used for the film coordinates of fiducial marks in the photograph taken by 9-inch Wild-type camera. Although it goes without saying that I must be prepared to face substantial margins of error, as long as I use these theoretical values for interior orientation parameters during the error-correction processes, I had no choice. Effective Solutions and Results Effective solutions to the difficulties described above were offered by the ground-truth checking and GCP measurements in the field (Figure 14.2). This is obvious in a comparison of the qualities of pre-fieldwork prototype map and post-fieldwork counterpart (Matsumoto 2005:Figures 5\u201324 and 4\u20132). The extremely accurate GCPs of only several-millimetre difference derived from the RTK DGPS readings, in particular, allowed us to produce high-quality Digital Terrain Models for the overlap area of the aerial photographs and to minimize the margins of error in the subsequent triangulation process based on the DTM. The resultant orthoimages show that the new data reduced a substantial amount of horizontal displacements between DGPS readings and the corresponding points in the orthoimages. Archaeological features on the ground were again digitized on the orthoimages in reference to the field drawings. The subsequent shapefile5 was finally superimposed over the other shapefiles of topographic and architectural features (e.g., contour lines, water bodies, and modern roads) in a single overlay and printed as the finalized site map (Figure 14.4). It is very important to note here that we have to pay attention to the fact 14: Making a GIS-Based Digital Map of Pachacamac \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 14.4. The resultant site map of Pachacamac (Scale = 1:10,000). \u0018\u0018\u0018 Go Matsumoto that the conversion process of the DGPS readings into a new shapefile induced a substantial amount of vertical displacements up to about 15 m in comparison with the conventional data sources. The discrepancy is probably due to the lack of a locally fitting geoid model for Peru. Discussion Over the last few years, we have obtained a growing number of external data sources inherently compatible with GIS; however, many old and new data available to us have considerable limitations in regard to precision, accuracy, and information density. Thus, as long as we have to use problematic data sources, both old and new, it would be virtually impossible for us to conduct site mapping and related data collections that are precise and accurate enough to undertake truly scalable analyses ranging from intra-feature to macro-regional levels. This implies that a full-scale application of GIS in archaeology is not yet practical or feasible in a true sense. Furthermore, even though one can obtain very precise and accurate data by means of the state-of-the-art equipment and techniques, they may not fit well into the conventional site data collected by old, planimetrically less accurate methods. Since we inevitably face and have to accept substantial margins of error that stem from various practical details, it may not be worth pursuing the highest precision and accuracy at the expense of limited resources (Matsumoto 2005). Not only the selection of the most appropriate mapping techniques, but also the required level of precision and accuracy needs to be carefully considered according to our research interest, field conditions resulting from varied natural and cultural formation processes, expertise of field crew, and available data. Under no circumstances should we adopt any kind of technique without deliberate consideration. Inefficient applications will not only waste precious resources but also unnecessarily detach us away from our own duties such as explanatory explorations of material remains and, if temporarily, lead us to become absorbed merely in technology. We should keep in mind that GIS and other related techniques are nothing but research tools. It is important to note here that I do not mean to be so realistic that I foreclose the prospect of future development of archaeological applications of GIS and surrounding technologies. It goes without saying that it is one of the 14: Making a GIS-Based Digital Map of Pachacamac \u0018\u0018\u0018 critical issues for GIS-based archaeology to build and integrate more reliable site databases for subsequent archaeological analyses and discussions. However, the implementation of such an ambitious enterprise will require very careful planning based on a long-term perspective and a substantial amount of effort and perseverance to obtain and organize high-quality data. In order to maximize the efficiency with the minimum of exertion and expenditure, I argue that the establishment of collaborative work environment and active data sharing among archaeologists and/or projects would be most desirable. In this regard, GLOBALBASE sets out architecture of great promise based on excellent philosophy (Mori 2005, n.d.). With its ultimate goals of storing every piece of existing spatial information within a single knowledge system and making it available free to the general public, this system enables us to share map information linked to each other through the World Wide Web (WWW) and to go freely back and forth between them, irrespective of the differences in coordinate system and whereabouts of map information. It no longer requires any resources except for a computer connected to the Internet. The only fear is that the system relies exclusively on the spirit of international volunteerism as with the case of WWW and open-source software. By improving its practicality and data quality, GLOBALBASE would not be impossible to get closer to the ideal in our mind. Most of the serious problems that I have encountered in the course of map-making have not been explained elsewhere and thus can be resolved only through a continuing process of trial and error. A series of valuable know-how gained from such processes should be accumulated and made available freely to those interested. They are no less useful than what can be gained from formal in-class training, often complemented by laboratory exercises. Fully aware of this fact, a handful of graduate students of archaeology recently inaugurated an online study group in a Social Networking Site (SNS) and have organized offline workshops for active interaction and information sharing among the registered members (Archaeo-GIS Workshop 2007). I hope that such a grassroots attempt, together with the data sharing scheme noted above, trigger macro-regional level cooperation among archaeologists. \u0018\u00180 Go Matsumoto Conclusion In order to fundamentally resolve the aforementioned practical problems, as I noted above, there is no alternative but to sweep the slate clean and start over to slowly and meticulously build up the maps by taking measurements in the field by the use of state-of-the-art survey equipment. However, to aspire to perfection is virtually impossible, and there is little point in pursuing extreme precision and accuracy for archaeological problem-solving even though it is backed up by sufficient funds. What is most practical and sensible is to find the most efficient way to achieve immediate goals (e.g., rough mapping for preliminary research and precise large-scale mapping for detailed contextual analysis) on the basis of a clear understanding of given resources and surrounding realities, and concurrently to contribute to data accumulation based on a long-term plan for establishment of more reliable site database. Furthermore, the digitalization of archaeological resources for the years to come will also encourage active in-depth discussions concerning data acquisition and management at the stage of research design. Subsequently, I hope, many archaeologists will argue for the need to establish a collaborative work environment and active data-sharing networks among them. I believe that a critical key to filling the gap between theory and practice in GIS-based archaeology would be found in mutual collaboration and voluntarism of archaeologists.

The difference between the known coordinates and the GPS-calculated coordinates is the error that needs to be corrected for the accuracy of survey or mapping grade GPS applications. The correction of this error can be done either by bringing the data from the Reference Station and Rover together in an asynchronous, post-processing mode after the field measurements are completed (Post Processed Kinematic or PPK) or by instantaneously broadcasting the error correction information produced by the Reference Station to the Rover for real-time corrections (Lillesand et al. 2004:34).

In the last few years, cost surface analysis has become part of exchange system studies. The basic problem with this GIS methodology is that the principles of analysis are based on modern economic theory and on the concept of economic rationality. This kind of analysis does not take into account the social aspects of landscape. In my PhD dissertation, I use a novel approach to cost surface analysis to archaeological distribution maps to create circulation maps. based on social and physical cost raster. This cultural cost surface map was added Introduction Geographic Information Systems have, for the past years, revolutionized the way in which disciplines such as geography, ecology, and archaeology handle and interpret spatial data. These information systems supply a way to manipulate varied complex data with much flexibility. One of the advantages of GIS is its ability to visualize data, either in two or three dimensions. Another advantage is the possibility to calculate distances and surfaces of spatial phenomena in relation to specific physical characteristics. Because there are numerous types of \u0018\u0018\u0018 spatial analysis available to us through GIS software, this software is especially useful for studying exchange systems. In this context, cost surface analysis has emerged to model the movement of individuals through landscape. A cost surface is a computerized model of the landscape for which each part of the surface has a designated value or cost. This value or cost represents the effort or the energy required to reach a certain point after departing from another point. The total cost is determined by logarithms that incorporate not only the distances in relation to the final point, but also the incidental costs related to particular aspects of the landscape as well. The researcher determines these incidental costs as they derive from systems of classification in which, for each characteristic of the landscape, a certain value of cost is ascertained. For example, to find out the best route of access to a determined point within an area characterized as having savannas and dense forests, differentiated values of cost must be designated for each specific type of vegetation. When a model of cost surface analysis is constructed, the cost value of each area is established in relation to the area of lesser-cost value. Logarithms used for cost surface analysis can be classified in two large groups: isotropic logarithms, that is, those that consider the cost of moving in a surface without reckoning the direction of such movement, and anisotropic logarithms, in which the direction of the movement that affects the displacement cost is taken into account. Generally in archaeology the expended energy is a function of differences in the elevation of the land. This is a simple idea, since other environmental characteristics may also influence energy expense. For instance, this is the case when one considers moving through dunes and areas of dense vegetation covering. One must also remember that going through landscapes is something conditioned not only by physical aspects but by symbolic ones as well. The existence of sacred areas, taboo areas, or the simple desire of passing through a specific village can have more influence upon the structure of displacement than the actual topography of the area. Nowadays the majority of cost surface analysis models follow an interpretative structure that derives from modern economic theory. That reduces the cost analysis to a question of distance rationalization. Although cost surface analysis is in part related to theories of minimization of effort, cost is a relative measure that varies according to the specific society under analysis. In this perspective, cost surface analysis incorporates not only different physical factors such as declivity, soil types, and vegetation, but also cultural factors. This paper presents a new proposition for cost surface analysis, \u0018\u0018\u0018 Jos\u00e9 Roberto Pellini where cost is based in two differentiated groups of parameters: physical factors and cultural factors. The Case Study Until the beginning of the twentieth century, Nubia was a little-known and relatively unexplored region, at least from the archaeological point of view. With the gradual increase in lake level at the Aswan High Dam and the subsequent construction of Nasser Lake, the culturally rich area that lay underneath old Nubia was about to be completely flooded. Because of these factors, three campaigns of rescue took place in the Nubia region in order to salvage and to preserve the remaining archaeological portions of this area. UNESCO promoted the largest campaign in the 1960s. For this research, an area was chosen between Qustul in Egypt and Gamai in Sudan, because this region has been one of the more intensively worked areas in the rescue projects. These regions have been excavated by different teams; the region between Qustul and Adindan was part of the portions attributed to the Oriental Institute of Chicago and the area between Faras and Gamai was excavated by the Scandinavian Joint Expedition. They have been chosen by us because they have also been the subject of more precise publications, especially regarding dated archaeological evidence of the New Empire. In order to make the task somewhat easier, phases of occupation have been defined based on the chronology applied by Williams (1992) to the shafts excavated by the Oriental Institute. The chronology used by S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh and Troy (1990) has also been applied to the shafts of the Scandinavian Joint Expedition. These phases are: I: II: III: IV: Beginning of the eighteenth dynasty down to Hatshepesut (1550\u20131479 B.C.). From Hatshepesut to Tutmosis III (1479\u20131427 B.C.). From Amenophis II to Tutmosis IV (1427\u20131391 B.C.). Amenophis III and Amarna age (1391\u20131323 B.C.). 15: Economy in Ancient Egypt \u0018\u0018\u0018 V: End of Amarna age to the beginning of the nineteenth dynasty (1323\u20131300 B.C.). Cost Surface Analysis Current models of cost surface analysis try to impose a Cartesian and abstract geometry on a reality that is basically subjective and contingent. Space in these cases is seen as a physical, purely separate entity of time and is expressed as an absolute value. Space is not a neutral Cartesian concept; it is socially constructed. Therefore, in cost surface analysis, it is necessary to map the environment in order to represent it in a contextual perspective. Having this proposition in mind, in the cost surface analysis, cost was based on two different groups of parameters: physical factors and cultural factors, which are referred to as contextual factors. In the first group (the physical factors), characteristics such as topography, relief, vegetation, geological and palaeo-geological formation, etc., were used. The contextual factors group includes a series of historical data, like urban planning, the positioning of palaces and temples in relation to the urban architecture (O\u2019Connor 1993), the number of villages around each city, the amount of grain consumption, and the demographic density (Hassan 1990). The data was tabulated and entered into a database that was used to create three different layers: an administrative map with the location of the temples, centres, and villages of Nubia; a demographic density map; and a calories consumption map. These three layers have been united based on original raster of contextual cost. The next step was to transform the raster of physical cost and the raster of contextual cost into a final raster that would include a representation of the general surface cost for the study area. The final result was a raster of contextual cost that united cultural and physical information. With the creation of a contextual cost raster, the distribution maps of excavated archaeological materials were analyzed. For each object in each phase of occupation, a map of distribution was created. In this way, each archaeological object inside the study area was located using its original coordinates. Trend maps were then generated from this data. For the interpolation base, the \u0018\u00180 Jos\u00e9 Roberto Pellini method of Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) was used. Finally, each map of distribution was recalculated in accordance with the contextual cost raster. The final result is a series of maps identified as circulation maps. In the circulation maps, the blank spaces represent areas with little or no circulation of products, or areas where there are limited interaction links. The areas that present a gradation between black colour tones represent areas where the circulation of objects is intense, in such a way that the circulation intensity, or the interaction intensity, is demonstrated by the increase in colour variation. The larger the area covered with tones of black colour, the higher the interaction frequency will be, resulting in a greater circulation of products (a series of successive exchanges between one point and another). The isolated points in black colour represent areas where the circulation is centric. In these cases, the circulation is directed to a specific point. In this article, the analysis is limited to phases I, II, and V, as these phases are considered to be the most representative ones. Beginning the analysis with the circulation maps of jars and bowls (Figures 15.1\u20136), items considered of ordinary domestic use, in phase I the vessels are circulated within a small area. The difference between the blank areas (areas with circulation absence) and areas with gradations of black colour (areas with circulation) are almost equal. In phase I, the circulation of these objects is limited and confined to few interaction links. On the other hand, in phase II there is a major diffusion of the circulation area. In this phase, jars and bowls are circulating intensely all over the area. This means that they take part in a greater number of interaction links. The absence of blank tones is an indication that these objects are circulating everywhere. In phase V, jars and bowls present a distinct circulation pattern. The jars lose popularity and, even though they still circulate, they seem to be restricted to a smaller area. As for bowls, they continue to circulate with some intensity, although in a more reduced way. Regarding objects that are linked to importation (Figures 15.7\u201311), such as wine jars and amphorae, it is clear that they have a larger circulation pattern during phase II, much in the same way as the jars and earthen bowls. The difference is in the intensity of the circulation. While jars and bowls appear to be circulating all over the area, the imported objects, wine jars and amphorae, have a more centric distribution pattern. 15: Economy in Ancient Egypt \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 15.1.

Imported Objects Phase 2. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Jos\u00e9 Roberto Pellini Conclusion After losing the political and economic control of Nubia during the Second Intermediate Period, the Egyptian state started a novel policy, that of reconquering Nubia in the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty. Old administrative centres were reconstructed and new forts were built. But what was the role of the Egyptians in Nubia? Was it settlement, exploration, reaffirmation of the real deity of the Egyptian government, or a policy of mutual benefit? Perhaps the answer can be found, at least in the initial phase of the eighteenth dynasty, in the great political and economic freedom enjoyed by the kingdom of Teh Khet, located between Debeira and Serra. According to Smith (1976), this little kingdom was left under the control of local princes, given that members of local families formed the majority of the bureaucratic sector. The Egyptian administration functioned in a higher sphere, mainly in matters related to the maintenance of local order. The eventual freedom that the local government had made it possible for the people to have certain privileges, for example, access to imported products from Egypt. As it is affirmed by S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh and Troy (1990), phase I of the Fadrus occupation is characterized by a generous and valuable distribution of goods, which made it possible for the high class and for part of the middle class to have direct access to goods of prestige and status. Therefore, the Egyptian policy in Nubia included a territorial dominance based on a balanced political relationship that aimed to generate mutual benefits for both sides. During the middle part of the eighteenth dynasty (phases III and IV), Egyptian policy substitutes the old local high class for Egyptian bureaucrats. This act results in a significant reduction of the local high class. At the same time, there was a gradual shift of the administrative centres towards Dongola, in the south. This political shift leads to the weakness of the local economy at the old administrative centres. They lose their level of importance in the administration of the region. The consequence of this change can be observed in the burials that are analyzed below. In phases III, IV, and V of the occupation, there is a decline of the immobilized wealth in the tombs. At the same time, there is a significant increase in domestic items that are locally produced. This may be due to the disappearance of the old high class and to the increase in burials of members of the low class. 15: Economy in Ancient Egypt \u0018\u0018\u0018 With these political and economic changes, the circulation patterns of products also change. In general, there is a drop in the intensity of circulation. In the beginning of the occupation (phase I), there was an increase in the circulation of ordinary and prestige objects. During the final phases of occupation (phases IV and V), the ordinary goods continued to circulate, but there was an almost complete reduction in the circulation of objects of value, such as metals, amphorae, imported wine jars, and other objects. Based on the results of this analysis, two systems of exchange were in operation during the New Empire in Egypt and Nubia: a system that resulted in a diffuse and generalized circulation of goods and a system that resulted in a centric and directed circulation of goods. In the first system, ordinary objects and those in daily use circulated, and in the second system, prestige goods circulated. In the areas where the presence of a diffuse circulation is observed, there is a system of direct circulation, that is, the members of each economic unit travel to other localities in order to acquire the products that they need. In this sense, the residents of each locality have to go to innumerable places to satisfy their needs, and this creates an increase in the distances covered, resulting in a similar increase of the transaction costs. In a direct system of distribution, for instance, as it occurs in the reciprocity case, in a set number of production points N, each producer would have the necessity to visit or to be visited by N\u20131 representatives of other localities so that there is a full distribution system operating, with one consequent express day for N of (N\u20131)/2. In systems like this there are increased interactions between individuals and so the objects leave their original point and travel, from one hand to another, until they reach their final destination. As a greater number of people could be involved in these exchange systems, the maintenance of the social forces and good relations between neighbourhoods are some of the main factors sustaining the system. In this case, as is pointed out by Janssen (1994:135), everyone is a debtor and a creditor to someone else. Here the performance of the community is seen as proof of the willingness to participate with great generosity. The individuals that appear in this system are moral individuals. In the circulation maps (Figures 15.1\u201311), this system can be perceived where there is a predominance of areas with more gradations of black colour tones. On the other hand, in the areas where focal and direct circulation is observed, the objects leave their original source and follow directly towards their \u0018\u0018\u0018 Jos\u00e9 Roberto Pellini destination without going through a great number of interactions. In this case there are probably movements of appropriation towards a centre and a subsequent distribution from this centre. This is an example of indirect circulation, where products and services of an economic unit are acquired in some central place; thus the individuals do not need to travel to different places to get the products that they desire. In indirect systems, such as redistribution or in market systems where a locality functions as a central place of distribution, the inhabitants of the nearby villages will have to travel only for a certain time, since the day can be expressed only for N\u20131. In the circulation maps, these systems can be perceived where there are concentration points. This happens because the products are being concentrated in local areas and being distributed around. As was pointed out above, GIS has brought many advances in the study of ancient societies, mainly their exchange systems, but one must be careful when dealing with cultural data. This new model of cost surface analysis, a contextual cost surface analysis, is an attempt to adapt this new technology of GIS to the study of ancient societies. It is hoped that this research will contribute to a better understanding of past exchange systems.

This paper describes methods and results of spatial analyses, based upon Space Syntax mathematics defined in Hillier and Hanson (1984). Base data came from maps of a set of eight Terminal Late Woodland (Emergent Mississippian) sites from the American Bottom of Illinois, built between AD 800 and 900, which belonged to the Dohack and Range phases. This study compared ratios of built space to open space in villages and made a metric comparison of the organization of open space in each site. Measurements were based upon the atomic organization of individual architectural components and their spatial relationships to one another. The data from this project suggest that, although the relative amounts of open space in the sites did not change, the organization of open space literally became more central through time. Sociocultural organizational implications are tatively described the built environment within these villages. The discrepancy trends in the built environment that are not otherwise readily apparent.

Previous investigators did not note such patterns when they qualisuggests that Space Syntax methods may be useful for discerning archaeological testing in Mississippian and other archaeological contexts should be conducted to \u0018\u0018\u0018 Introduction This paper presents the results of spatial analyses made upon a set of Terminal Late Woodland (Emergent Mississippian) sites from American Bottom, using models and ideas based upon the techniques described in The Social Logic of Space, by Hillier and Hanson (1984). A number of authors were important in the development of this paper (Banning and Byrd 1989; Ferguson 1994; Foster 1989; Potter 1998; Van Dyke 1999). The intent was to test the utility of Space Syntax methodology as a tool to recognize spatial signatures among eight Emergent Mississippian communities in the American Bottom of Illinois, directly east of St. Louis, on the opposite side of the Mississippi River (Figure 16.1). These settlements are all components of the Range Site (11-S-47), five from the Dohack phase and three from the Range phase, which are adjacent in the American Bottom chronology at AD 800\u2013850, and 850\u2013900, respectively (Bareis and Porter 1984:129,134). The general patterning of Mississippian architectural elements is well documented throughout the Midwest and Southeast of the United States. Mississippians arranged their towns around a central plaza. The organization of individual houses and group neighbourhoods served to accentuate this arrangement. The addition of palisade walls for controlling access to the towns added a further level of spatial definition, when present. The presence of mounds added another level of spatial definition, often providing a focal point for the plaza. These mounds were usually truncated pyramids, the tops of which were reserved for communal ceremonies, residences of important families, or charnel houses for honoured ancestors; however, many varieties of shapes have been recorded (Lewis et al. 1998). The Range site is about twenty kilometres from what would become the largest Mississippian site of Cahokia, which rapidly expanded about AD 1050 at the beginning of the early Mississippian period (Pauketat 2004). Many accomplished investigators have used the archaeological record of the Range site\u2019s earlier communities to trace the material remnants of later Mississippian culture in the American Bottom. Others have discussed the sociocultural implications of various Range site settlement plans in conjunction with changes in their artefact assemblages. Kelly (1990) and Fortier and McElrath (2002) have discussed the village plans of phases at the Range site, not included here, that preceded and succeeded those described in this paper. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Joshua J. Wells Figure 16.1. The extent of Mississippian influence in North America. The American Bottom is denoted by the star. Based upon maps in Hall (2000:12, 24) and Townsend (2004:13). This paper tests a methodology which can mathematically describe some of these plans (these spatial syntaxes) and tests whether they may be differentiated in a quantitatively spatial manner, rather than in the illustrative, prosaic fashion that dominates the archaeological literature. How Space Syntax Works Put simply, Space Syntax is the study of open space that is bounded and divided by human construction (Figure 16.2). As people build the environment of their dwellings, hamlets, villages, and cities, subtle (and direct) manifestations of their perceptions towards order will begin to develop. In The Social Logic of Space (Hillier and Hanson 1984), its two authors studied, most notably, small villages 16: A Space Syntax Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 in the French countryside, attempting to find patterns and meaning in the seemingly haphazard routines of their growth. Their notion of elementary formulae may be used to describe any arrangement of buildings based upon their most basic components (the common shape of a building and its orientation to others of this kind). When perceived in a recursive pattern, these elementary formulae will use their low-level attributes to form a more grandiose structure, analogous perhaps to atoms forming a molecule (Hillier and Hanson 1984:77\u201381). The \u201cy space,\u201d or open space, is the most important variable within the mechanisms of Space Syntax. The differences of how constructions relate to one another is immense; thus, Hillier and Hanson (1984) have developed several different ways of examining y space. These relationships are robustly quantitative and, as such, require well-made original maps in order to create new maps that interpret the y space as organized by the constructions, X. The basic elements of y space study are convex spaces and axial spaces. For brevity\u2019s sake, this paper only addresses the convex space of the Range and Dohack phase settlements. X: human construction that occupies Y space and defines y space. x: open spaces that are bound by human definition to X, such as courtyards and gardens. This space is binding towards y space. y: open space within an area bounded by X and/or x. Y: carrier space that contains X, x, and y; the whole of two-dimensional open space exterior to the boundaries of human construction. Figure 16.2. Definitions of space by Hillier and Hanson (1984). \u0018\u00180 Joshua J. Wells Convex spaces are entirely convex on the exterior of their boundary and entirely concave on the interior of their boundary (Figure 16.3). Their analytical definition was described by Ferguson (1994): The procedure for producing convex maps is essentially a visual one. First the boundary of the largest convex space in the settlement is delineated, then spaces. The property of convexity translated into human behaviour means that in a flat convex space any two people that can be seen by a third person can also see each other. [Ferguson 1994:16] the next largest, and so on until all spaces have been sub-divided into convex To investigate the arrangement of convex space, we must first recognize the X and x constructions that bind and determine the organization of the y space. In this archaeological context, it means delineating the boundaries of a site and the position of each building within that site. This is necessary for any quantification involving the gross numbers of the constructions and convex spaces involved, and also for methods which need specific geographic measurements of perimeter and area. Secondly, the relationships between the buildings must be determined \u2013 taking specific notice of those buildings that conjoin or are built so closely to one another that they effectively leave no y space between them (this phenomenon is called an island, islands are the defining built feature that breaks up open space into convex pieces). Figure 16.3. Examples of one convex space (l), one concave space (m), and one concave space divided into two convex spaces for analysis (r); based upon Ferguson (1994). 16: A Space Syntax Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 The first measurement of convex space is the convex articulation from Hillier and Hanson (1984). This is a measurement of the synchrony of a site, where synchrony is defined as the relative quantity of space invested in the set of syntactic relations at that site (Hillier and Hanson 1984:92). Convex articulation is defined as: (number of convex spaces) / (number of buildings). See Figure 16.4. The larger the quotient is, the greater the break-up of the y space is, yielding less synchrony. This can be easily conceived if you consider Figures 16.5a and 16.5b, where the more ordered graph has fewer convex spaces than the scattered one. The more ordered graph is also more synchronous, with a lower convex articulation value (Hillier and Hanson 1984:92\u20133, 98). The second measurement of convex space is the grid convexity score, again from Hillier and Hanson (1984:99). This considers the layout of a site in relation to the most perfect orthogonal grid that might be formed using the built components of the site. Grid convexity uses the notion of islands, mentioned above, and is defined as: {[(number of islands)^0.5 + 1]^2} / (number of convex spaces). The quotients given by this function will range between 0 and 1, where 1 is representative of a perfect grid. See Figures 16.4, 16.5a, and 16.5b. James Potter (1998) expanded upon Hillier and Hanson\u2019s (1984) definitions and suggested his own integration score to study the organization of convex y space within an archaeological site. Potter (1998) found that he needed a way of overcoming spatial differences that were a product of scale but were not necessarily related to the recursion of atomic construction practices. By accounting for the size of the three largest convex polygons in a site, in relationship to the available amount of open area, he could better characterize the morphology of open space. He wrote: This method allows the efficient comparison of sites of radically different morphological configuration and scale. In addition, this method is sensitive along both spatial dimensions to changes in open space structure over time, and can thus help isolate the variable involved in the long term integrative strategies adopted by a particular settlement. (Potter 1998:143) Integration is defined as: (a/b) / (b/c). In this formula, a = the sum of the areas of the three largest convex polygons, b = the total open area of the site (y space, or total site area minus the area occupied by houses), c = total site area (Potter 1998:140). See Figure 16.4. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Joshua J. Wells convex articulation: (per Hillier and Hanson [1984]) (number of convex spaces) (number of buildings) {{[(number of islands)^0.5] + 1}^2} (number of convex spaces) (a/b) (b/c) Grid convexity: (per Hillier and Hanson [1984]) integration score: (per Potter [1998]) a = the sum of the areas of the three largest polygons b = the total open area of the site (y space) c = total site area Figure 16.4. Ratio formulae for characterizing convex space. The R ange Site The Range site was chosen because of the large number of sequential villages it contained. The investigated villages span a period of little more than a hundred years, perhaps five generations. During that century, material culture, domestic structures, and settlement patterns changed from earlier Woodland forms into a sequence closer to that of the early Mississippian period. The Dohack phase (AD 800\u2013850) is the first Emergent Mississippian culture recognized by the American Bottom excavators. It is represented in several other sites along the modern I\u2013270 corridor, construction of which prompted the excavation. The Dohack phase is considered to exhibit a number of ancestral traits from the preceding Late Woodland Patrick phase (AD 600\u2013800), most notably in the ceramic traditions, where jars dominate and most items 16: A Space Syntax Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 16.5. a. An ordered orthogonal grid. b. A deformed orthogonal grid. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Joshua J. Wells are covered with cord-markings. Furthermore, people of the Dohack phase are considered to have been the first to produce maize in large quantities (Bareis and Porter 1984:129\u2013134). The structural features of the Dohack phase are considered to represent a social and spiritual model through their incorporation of a central square, with either a large, single structure, or four smaller ones contained within that space. John Kelly (1990) suggested that this was an early indication of the circle-andcross theme associated with a fire and sun deity complex. He noted that in ethnohistoric accounts the four corners of this central space were marked by logs oriented to the cardinal directions. The central building or clump of four structures in each Dohack phase area does indeed appear to be representative of this sort of spatial structure. Often a sacred fire would burn in the centre of the square ground. Its flames were perhaps recognized as an agent of the sun, who was the people\u2019s source of food and religious knowledge. This central area might also be the location of the Green Corn Ceremony, a religious rite that incorporated the first ripening corn of the season and would have been of vital social importance (Kelly et al. 1990:289\u201396). The Range phase (AD 850\u2013900) ceramic assemblage is comprised by approximately 50 per cent jars, followed closely by bowls (41%). The jars and bowls are generally cord-marked (about the neck in jars), and the jars have squared lips, sometimes with lugs. Both are tempered mainly with limestone, though there is a minor use of grog and grit (28% total). Although pottery temper does not permit an easy differentiation from the preceding Dohack phase, the more elaborate Range phase design motifs are useful markers (Bareis and Porter 1984:134\u201340). During the Range phase, some of the habitations contained interior courtyards, while in others the buildings were aligned to form rows. Clustering of buildings is not as prominent as in the preceding Dohack phase. Range phase habitations were generally smaller in size and contained fewer houses. Bareis and Porter (1984:140) wrote that Range phase habitations are considered to come in at least three different types of community pattern. One of these is analogous to the earlier Dohack formations, with a circular organization of structures surrounding a central area that contains a post pit in the centre. This is an example of a statement that can be re-evaluated, on the terms of Space Syntax, using the Range phase settlements\u2019 metric attributes. 16: A Space Syntax Analysis \u0018\u0018\u0018 Methodology To produce the convex maps, I undertook a rubric similar to that of Ferguson (1994) in his volume Historic Zuni Architecture and Society. Ferguson (1994) noted that Hillier and Hanson (1984) neglected to supply mechanisms for demarcating boundaries on built areas that lack noticeable ending points (such as a road, wall, or natural object). To relieve this problem, Ferguson (1994) put an arbitrary ten-metre edge beyond all of the Zuni pueblos that he was going to study. In this vein, there is an arbitrary five-metre boundary beyond the farthest edges of the buildings under consideration. The maps were overlaid with their individual convex attributes, then scanned in order to work with them in Erdas Imagine GIS software. Using the grid points on the Dohack and Range phase settlement maps, each settlement was spatially referenced. The distance and area measurement techniques of the software generated the data needed for the formulas important to this study (total area, largest three polygons\u2019 areas, and structural [house] area). See Figures 16.6a,b, 16.7a,b for examples of excavation and convex space maps. Results As can be seen in Table 16.1, along with Figures 16.8 and 16.9, the Dohack and Range phases at the Range site can at least be separated in their spatial typologies with the technique forwarded by Potter (1998), but not necessarily those directly from Hillier and Hanson (1984). The range of measures for grid convexity and convex articulation are overlapping between the two phases. However, there is a complete separation of the two groupings based upon integration scores and the percentage of areas contained within the three largest convex polygons. Table 16.1.

The two phases have very similar convex articulations, indicating that the break-up of their open y space among their X buildings, while slightly more in the Range phase, is not terribly divergent from \u0018\u0018\u0018 Joshua J.

The grid convexities of the two phases are very similar, perhaps indicative of similarly conceived community ideals about spatial order. Although the percentage of open area, y, relative to the site as a whole, does not change much between the Dohack and Range phases, the allocation of it does. The Range phase is differentiated from the Dohack phase in that much more of the y area is contained within the three largest convex polygons. In other words, the central spaces of the villages become much larger during the Range phase. Finally the integration scores for the Range phase are higher. This is mainly due to the difference in the largest polygons\u2019 y area since the integration score also takes into account the overall percentage of y space within a site. Despite the suggestion by excavators that the variation within the Range phase settlements is a legacy from the earlier Dohack phase, the overall morphology of y space within the settlements of the Range phase is distinctly separate from the y space morphology of those from the earlier Dohack phase. Summary The observations of the researchers who have worked on the Range Site\u2019s Dohack and Range phase habitations over the last two decades are in some ways supported, but also augmented, by the implications of Space Syntax. The Range phase is distinctly different from its predecessor, the Dohack phase, regarding the way in which villagers were managing the relationship between private habitation areas and communal (possibly ritual and symbolic) space. The Range phase villagers were focusing more upon their central areas, creating a pattern more reminiscent of the future plazas during the Mississippian period proper. The recognition of this pattern should not be understood as evolutionary or as deterministic (cf. Fortier and McElrath 2002). Instead, archaeologists should vary their conceptions of space, and consider the impact of Terminal Late Woodland (Emergent Mississippian) spatial organizations on the milieu that sparked the beginning of the early Mississippian period. A major concern in the development of this study is the accuracy of the maps used, and the limitations of the archaeological focus that produced them. I by no means fault the excavators but rather acknowledge the fact that as archaeologists we must work with what is left to us by all the ravages of time. It is likely that these maps do not represent the fine details within the various \u0018\u00180 Joshua J. Wells settlements during their occupations, where screens, pits, scaffolds, and other relatively ephemeral constructs would also break up the open y space. Also, even in the short life spans of these habitations, it is not possible to say what the exact pattern of building construction and demolition was, thus obscuring possible changes in the syntactic pattern. However, these limitations can be overcome, or at least mitigated through detailed consideration. The methodologies created by Hillier and Hanson (1984), and expanded by their readers, are robust and deserve a chance to perhaps blossom in a new archaeological environment. For future investigations, it may be useful to study macro-blocks of buildings, rather than individual buildings, in sites where the number of X entities permits. This amalgamation might also permit the use of blocks of pits which suggest structures over them, or would in the very least restrict activity in their vicinities, although they must be separated from exterior storage and refuse pits that are scattered within the sites as X entities in their own right. Accounting for more facets in spatial reconstruction could provide a more realistic picture of the syntactic space in a Mississippian village, but it will take a great deal of concerted effort. If that is not possible, other methods should be devised and tested to attempt to gain more thorough understandings of site planning on the part of (pre)Mississippian peoples. Not least in importance are the villages and hamlets of the countryside, which, by the principles of elementary formulae, as described by Hillier and Hanson (1984), should reflect the notions of space that are writ large in Mississippian centres. Although Hillier and Hanson (1984) have been critiqued for suggesting Durkheimian traits may be associated with various forms of space structure (Batty 1985; Lawrence 1986), and even though some employers of Space Syntax have attempted to create other proofs of cultural theory with graphs, the typological aspects of Space Syntax appeal to me the most. It may be possible, with enough information, to trace the development of Mississippian spatial organizational traits across time and geography throughout the extent of Mississippian influence. This could inform investigators testing for either the diffusion or the independent rise of Mississippian organizational values. Such a model would be useful, transferable, and testable; more so than a solely localized and subjective explanation of spatial patterning. Acknowledgments: I thank Dr. P.

String-matching evaluates how similar each individual case is to all the documented and tested methods of space syntax with the technique of string- \u0018\u0018\u0018 others in a sample with a value called \u2018similarity.\u2019 This method, together with the paper for the syntactical analysis of an incomplete data of houses. concept of the \u2018inequality genotype\u2019 in space syntax, has been employed in this Introduction Space syntax technique is a major tool in both architectural and archaeological studies, as a means for analyzing spatial morphology of built environments. Most of the architectural and archaeological studies which use space syntax methods to investigate the spatial morphology of houses, employ cases that are perfectly recorded and exclude incomplete ones, as clearly labelled, spatially accurate architectural plan layouts are essential in Space Syntax analysis (Chapman 1990; Cooper 1997; Dawson 2002; Gilchrist 1994; Kirsan 2005; Orhun 1997). However there are situations, which one would need to piece together the spatial history of a house from the series of clues present in an incomplete and/or imperfect data set as usually found in vernacular and archaeological cases (Bustard 1997; D\u00fcring 2001; Kirsan 2003; Shapiro 1997). This study, which is one of those, deals with two groups of \u2018clear\u2019 and \u2018unclear\u2019 vernacular houses from rural Cyprus, gathered retrospectively through first-hand observations and fieldwork, and attempts to show how far it would be possible to reconstruct the unclear cases from the evidence of surviving remains, with the help of a recent technique of spatial analysis known as \u2018string-matching.\u2019 Unlike most of the archaeological studies of prehistoric buildings, which consist mainly of unclear cases, this study enjoys the privilege of dealing with some clear cases besides the unclear ones provided by standing architectural evidence. The clear cases are taken as a yardstick or base data, against which clues are investigated to predict the unclear ones. The prediction is based on the theory of genotypes first introduced by Hillier and Hanson (Hillier and Hanson 1984), and the use of Multimatch,1 a tool to automate and apply the prediction in a systematic manner with the aid of an expert knowledge of vernacular architecture. Space syntax theory and tools have been widely used in housing research for investigating their spatial morphology (Amorim 1999; Brown and Tahar 2001; Hanson 1998; Hillier et al. 1987; Kirsan 2003; Orhun et al. 1995, 1996; \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton Shoul 1993; Trigueiro 1994). The key methodological device for these studies has been the uncovering of spatial and spatio-functional consistencies or \u2018genotypes,\u2019 as Hillier names them (Hillier et al. 1987) that correspond to cultural or ethnic groups. The concept of the genotype, particularly with respect to domestic building, has been established in space syntax literature (Hanson 1998:32, 269\u2013270; Hillier and Hanson 1984:12\u201313, 143, 154; Hillier et al. 1987; Hillier 1996:36, 83, 249\u2013250, 429\u2013431). In particular, Hanson provides the following, useful definition: Function thus acquired a spatial expression which could also be assigned a numerical value. Where these numerical differences were in a consistent order across a sample of plans from a region, society or ethnic grouping then we could say that a cultural pattern existed, one which could be detected in the configuration itself rather than in the way in which it was interpreted by minds. We called this particular type of numerical consistency in spatial patterning a housing \u2018genotype.\u2019 [Hanson 1998:32] This body of research suggests that it is likely to expect a culture to manifest itself through one or two dominant syntactic \u2018genotypes\u2019 at any time and with variation associated with the passage of time. The housing genotypes have been traditionally determined by the investigation of the way individual spaces have been configured within the house. For this reason, the spaces have been expressed as a numerical inequality, ordered from the most to the least integrated. This has been a key methodological device in space syntax studies to investigate the existence of a consistent order in the integration values of spaces across a sample. This type of consistency in spatial patterning points to the existence of a cultural pattern and is called the inequality genotype (Hillier et al. 1987:364). The use of clearly labelled plan layouts with clearly identifiable rooms and entrances is fundamental to the very concept of building genotype. Hillier and Hanson argued in their earlier work, The Social Logic of Space, that labels are more significant in gamma 2 than in alpha and that, \u201ca genotype in gamma can be identified in terms of associations between labels of spaces and differentiations in how those spaces relate to the complex as a whole, in terms of the syntactic dimensions\u201d3 (Hillier and Hanson 1984:154). On the other hand, as the integration values attached to each space are calculated on the basis of the 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 relationship of that space to all the others within the configuration, all the spaces within a network of spaces contribute to the calculation. Thus, even if one of the relations between any pair of spaces is unclear, the results will be meaningless. Given the ambiguous nature of so much archaeological material, archaeologists often experience difficulties when trying to use quantitative techniques (Brown 1990; Fairclough 1992; Leach 1978). The success of the application of space syntax analysis to archaeological material has been questioned in archaeological literature by Marion Cutting (Cutting 2003). The primary problem mentioned by the author has been the fact that, as a quantitative access analysis, space syntax requires full architectural plans where rooms and their entrances are clearly identified. In the absence of perfect data some researchers had to make assumptions when applying the technique, which made it a less convincing tool (Bustard 1997; Shapiro 1997). The question here is, how can the concept of \u2018genotype\u2019 be utilized to investigate incomplete and imperfect data sets both in terms of labels of spaces and their permeability relations, as in archaeological cases where one would need to piece together the story form a series of clues present in the sample? In this paper, it is proposed that a technique known as \u2018string-matching\u2019 may be used together with the concept of building genotype to analyze deficient samples spatially and to make predictions about unclear cases based on a clear base data. It will include an empirical section examining a small sample of vernacular houses from Cyprus, which are close to extinction, in order to fully illustrate this method. Spatial String-Matching It was demonstrated in earlier work by Ruth Conroy Dalton (Conroy 2001) that a technique drawn from mathematics/information theory, known as \u2018stringmatching,\u2019 could be brought to bear upon an architectural problem. This method of analysis is based upon the assignment of a unique, identifying label to specific, key spaces or locations in the environment. A string is simply a sequence of characters or symbols. In this particular case the characters represent the functional-spaces that constitute the house, and the ordering of the sequence (or string) is determined by the integration values of the spaces relative to each other, as calculated with customary space syntax methods. Therefore not only \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton are labels fundamental to the very concept of the building genotype in space syntax but they are necessary for the string-matching method to be computable. Rooms, which make up the house, are assigned a label so that the house can then be represented as a character string constructed from the sequence of spaces according to their integration values. String-matching then measures how similar each individual inequality is to all the others in a sample of houses with a value called \u2018similarity.\u2019 The degree of similarity is equivalent to the average number of transformations required to fully transform one string into any other in the sample. The act of transformation is often considered to be a cost, and the purpose of all string distance algorithms is to calculate the least cost way of transforming one string into another. On a string, these acts consist of character deletion, character insertion, and occasionally (depending on the algorithm employed) character substitution, each with an associated cost.4 See the example below. sTRinG S-P-A-C-E S-P-A-C-E-D P-A-C-E-D P-A-V-E-D The insertion of character D at the end of the string. The deletion of character S from the start of the string. The substitution of character C by V in the middle of the string. acTion Once the range of permissible acts has been determined, the weight or cost for each act must be established, and it should be noted that the application of cost may not be uniform.5 The measure of \u2018distance\u20196 between any pair of sequences is determined by calculating the minimum number of transformations required to transform one string into another, and the value of \u2018similarity\u2019 is the average number of transformations required to transform a string into any other in the rest of the sample. Thus the technique is particularly useful for the identification of the most representative/popular or the most idiosyncratic house configuration in the whole sample. Low similarity values which point to low number of transformations indicate more popular or representative cases, and high values, more idiosyncratic ones. A string with the lowest similarity value is the most representative as it requires the fewest number of acts to be transformed into any 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 other in the sample, whereas the one with highest value is the most idiosyncratic as it needs to be subjected to a greater number of transformations to be changed into any other. String-matching can also be used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the overall sample. This is simply the range between the similarity values of the most and the least popular cases in a given sample. The following section presents an example empirical application of this method, which attempts to show how far it could be possible to make a prediction about unclear cases with the available material, with special reference to the Island of Cyprus, where the vernacular houses are close to extinction and await urgent action. Application of the Method to a Sample of Vernacular Cypriot Houses In order to illustrate how the feature of \u2018similarity\u2019 together with the concept of \u2018inequality genotype\u2019 can be employed to make a prediction about the original form of presently unclear houses, a sample of vernacular, rural houses from the Mesarion region in Cyprus has been analyzed. Figure 17.1 shows this study area within the island of Cyprus with specific locations of settlements from which the house samples have been selected. The sample of house plans analyzed date from the period before 1974, which marks the division of Cyprus into two ethnically diverse areas and the resultant exchange of populations and of their houses. The vernacular rural houses of Cyprus are all \u2018courtyard houses,\u2019 essentially driven by a peasantry-based agricultural economy and way of life. Besides their main domestic functions, they serve as a \u2018workshop\u2019 or \u2018laboratory\u2019 due to their abundance of work-related functions (Christodoulou 1959). Regardless of their Greek or Turkish origins, both groups\u2019 houses are formed by similar spatial elements such as: \u2018courtyards,\u2019 multi-functional living spaces referred as \u2018rooms\u2019 and \u2018main rooms,\u2019 multi-functional transitional spaces as \u2018central hallways\u2019 and \u2018loggias,\u2019 secondary spaces as \u2018kitchens,\u2019 and storage facilities for animals and goods.7 They follow a simple rectangular arrangement developed around inner courtyards and are one or two stories high. Most of the traditional houses that exist today are either close to extinction due to the negligence induced by the ethnic conflict between the two native populations of the island, namely Turkish and Greek Cypriots, and the resultant \u0018\u00180 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples Figure 17.1. The study area within the island of Cyprus with specific locations of house samples. \u0018\u0018\u0018 economic difficulties; or were renewed, enlarged, and adapted to meet changing needs and ways of life. The scarcity of substantial records of architectural drawings of these houses and their vanishing originality meant that recording and understanding this housing stock was a task of high priority and would require special \u2018methodological\u2019 efforts. The strong belief that valuable information can still be retrieved from these last bits of living evidence has inspired an investigation into a realm of incomplete data. The first task undertaken was to collect and record as much data as possible from the built architecture itself through first-hand observations and fieldwork.8 This was a \u2018retrospective data retrieval\u2019 in which the original house layouts belonging to the period prior to 1974 had been reconstructed whenever possible from the present situation of the houses. In terms of original spatial layouts, together with access relations and functions, the processes mentioned above produced a number of \u2018unclear\u2019 cases, the identification of which required a special effort of personal judgment and reasoning besides observations and interviews. Additionally, there were cases that remained either unchanged or with readily distinguishable changes. These were noted as \u2018clear\u2019 cases and were identified through direct observations or clear statements of their current inhabitants. Cases that did not yield any clues at all about their previous forms were not recorded. The problem of \u2018unclear\u2019 cases has resulted in a body of incomplete data, which, compared to the norm where \u201coccupation\u201d and \u201cspatial form\u201d go together, was necessarily \u2018deficient.\u2019 So the next task undertaken was to structure the sample through a set of \u2018detective\u2019 strategies and to attempt to uncover the story of unclear cases from the evidence and through the combinatorial application of the known methods of space syntax with string-matching methodology. Analytical Strategies To tackle the problems posed by the \u2018deficiency\u2019 of the sample and to piece together the story from a series of clues present in the incomplete data, certain \u2018analytical strategies\u2019 have been developed. It was evident that the plan layouts could be vague either in terms of permeability relations among the constituent spaces or of the functions of spaces. So, initially, the sample has been subdivided along this line as being \u2018clear\u2019 and \u2018unclear\u2019 either, \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton 1. 2. 3. syntactically: in terms of syntactic layout, i.e., location of doors and partitions (permeability relations) (SC or SU); or, functionally: in terms of labels, that is the functions of the spaces (FC or FU); or, both syntactically and functionally: cases that are both \u2018syntactically\u2019 and \u2018functionally\u2019 \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018unclear\u2019 (SC+FC or SU+FU).9 That is to say, in terms of uncertainties, \u2018syntactically unclear\u2019 (SU) cases are those whose plans are vague in terms of spatial relations (see houses in Figures 17.3a,b); \u2018functionally unclear\u2019 ones, those whose functions are vague (see Figures 17.2a,b), and the ones that are both syntactically and functionally unclear are the most complicated cases as they are vague both in terms of spatial relations and of their functions (SU+FU). This category has been excluded from the context of this study but will be addressed in future work. Description of the sample For the purposes of this study, forty-four houses which are both \u2018syntactically\u2019 and \u2018functionally\u2019 clear have been selected from a much wider database composed of both clear and unclear cases. This clear sub-sample is taken to behave as a \u2018base\u2019 data against which the unclear cases are to be compared and predicted. Then four unclear houses have been selected for the purpose of the study here, two of which are syntactically clear and functionally unclear (SC + FU), and two vice versa (SU + FC). Figures 17.2 and 17.3 display these unclear cases to be tested, respectively. In case of the first group (Figure 17.2a,b), the spatial layout and the permeability relations between the constituent spaces are clear; however, the functions of certain spaces are unclear. In the second group (Figure 17.3a,b), all the functions were identified; however, the permeability relations between some spaces are vague. Two houses have been selected for each category, one with only one unknown and one with more than one unknown variable. The house in Figure 17.2a is a typical, later period, courtyard house. It has a main living unit structured around a central closed hallway with two rooms opening off from it. It embodies several courtyard spaces as a kitchen, toilet, a stable, an independent room and a space whose function could not 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 be identified, marked with the character \u2018?\u2019. This house is a simple case for SC + FU with single unknown function. The house in Figure 17.2b is a more complicated case for the same category (SC + FU) with three unknown variables. The spatial layout is similar to the previous case, with a main living unit organized around a central hallway with all the secondary functions gathered around the courtyard. The main unit has an upper floor reached through a staircase located inside the central hallway. This house has an additional courtyard used exclusively by animals. The functions of the three spaces numbered as \u20184,\u2019 \u20185,\u2019 and \u20188\u2019 could not be identified. Figure 17.3a and b, again, contains two houses which exemplify the SU + FC cases. House 3, in Figure 17.3a, has the main living unit on the upper floor and all the secondary functions are located on the ground floor dispersed around the courtyard. All the functions were clearly identified. However, it was not clear whether the second entrance that stands today used to exist in its original form or not. House 4 in Figure 17.3b is a more complicated case. It is a larger house with many courtyard spaces besides the main living unit, which was structured around a loggia running in front of the rooms. All the functions were identified with a high level of accuracy; however, it could not be identified with great confidence whether the courtyard formed by spaces \u201817\u2019 and \u201818\u2019 originally used to exist or not. This has accompanying changes with it, such as the presence of the toilet and the two entrances, one from kitchen and the other from the main living room (space 3). Thus this house had more than one uncertainty regarding the syntactic layout. Procedure of Analysis The key spaces of all the forty-four clear houses have been initially assigned a number for the space syntax analysis and a label for string-matching analysis. Then, the justified permeability graphs have been drawn and the houses have been subjected to standard space syntax analysis for the calculation of integration values. The labels representing individual spaces have then been expressed as an inequality, ordered from left (high) to right (low) according to their integration values. As a result, forty-four character-strings have been obtained. These character-strings, which form the \u2018base\u2019 data, have then been subjected to string-matching analysis with the help of Multimatch software. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 Figure 17.2. a.

House 4: syntactically unclear and functionally clear case (SU+FC) with more than one unknown variables: a more complicated case. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton syntactically clear and Functionally unclear examples (sc +F u) House 1 \u2013 single unknown variable: House 1 has a clear spatial layout; however, the function of one of its spaces could not be identified. This space is represented by the character \u2018?\u2019. For the unknown space, the possibilities have been determined based on expert knowledge10 and experience of the real world sample. Three possibilities have arisen: it could either be a \u2018produce store\u2019 (P), a \u2018straw store\u2019 (T), or an \u2018animal shed\u2019 (A). Then each label has been added one at a time to the string and three options of character strings have been obtained to represent the house: Option 1: CHpAERKRR Option 2: CHTAERKRR Option 3: CHaAERKRR 0.748 0.761 0.756 Since the syntactic layout (spatial configuration) is clear, only the labels and not their position in the string are changed. Then, each of the possible strings has been individually subjected to string-matching analysis comparing it to the rest of the forty-four clear examples. Therefore, the analysis has been repeated three times for House 1. It was hypothesized that the option giving the lowest similarity value, when tested against the base data, is most likely to be the unknown function as it would be least idiosyncratic across the larger sample. In this case, Option 1 has the lowest similarity value, 0.748, as marked in bold. This implies that when the function of \u2018produce store\u2019 (P) is allocated to the queried space \u20184,\u2019 the resultant string is more similar to the rest of the clear cases: the \u2018base\u2019 data. Thus \u2018produce store\u2019 is conjectured to be the most likely function for unknown label \u2018?\u2019. House 2 \u2013 more than one unknown label: House 2 is another syntactically clear case \u2013 this time with three unidentified labels. These are spaces \u20184,\u2019 \u20185,\u2019 and \u20188,\u2019 as shown in the plan (Figure 17.3b). The inequality string of integration values is CH84EPAMm5. Since, once again, the relations among spaces are clearly identified, the order of the characters 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 remains the same, and in this case there are three unknown characters within the string. From a purely mathematical standpoint, there could be many permutations (straightforward combinatorial mathematics). However, when expert knowledge is brought to bear on the problem, it can easily be seen that the enumerations are restricted to a great extent. Architecturally, and based on the real world examples in the clear data, it can be conjectured that, while space \u20185\u2019 could either be an \u2018animal shed\u2019 or a \u2018straw store,\u2019 space \u20184\u2019 can be either a \u2018kitchen\u2019 or a \u2018room,\u2019 and space \u20188\u2019 is either a \u2018kitchen\u2019 or a \u2018produce store,\u2019 but not an \u2018animal shed,\u2019 as it is directly connected to space \u20184,\u2019 which is part of the main living unit. In summary, space \u20188\u2019 could be a \u201cK\u201d (kitchen) or a \u201cP\u201d (produce store); \u20184\u2019 could be a \u201cK\u201d (kitchen) or a \u201cR\u201d (room); \u20185\u2019 could be an \u201cA\u201d (animal shed) or a \u201cT\u201d (straw store). If we start assigning labels from the first unknown label in the sequence and consider space \u20188\u2019 to be a kitchen, then space \u20184\u2019 cannot be another kitchen logically but a room, \u201cR.\u201d Space \u20185,\u2019 which is the last label in the sequence could equally be an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cT.\u201d So we obtain two options here: 1. CHKREPAMmA 2. CHKREPAMmT On the other hand, if space \u20188\u2019 is assigned the function \u201cP\u201d (produce store), then space \u20184\u2019 should definitely be a kitchen, \u201cK,\u201d and similarly space \u20185\u2019 could be \u201cA\u201d or \u201cT.\u201d So the other two options obtained are: 3. CHPKEPAMmA 4. CHPKEPAMmT In total, four possibilities have been obtained to represent the original state of House 2. This means that four experiments have to be tested against the base data to determine which one is the closest to the real world examples or, in other words, is most likely to represent House 2. \u0018\u00180 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton Option 1: CHKREPAMmA Option 2: CHKREPAMmT Option 3: CHPKEPAMmA Option 4: CHPKEPAMmT 0.743 0.743 0.744 0.746 The similarity values for the four options against the base data have shown that options 1 and 2 have the smallest similarity values, which are both equal. This implies that space \u20188\u2019 was a kitchen (K), \u20184,\u2019 a room (R), and \u20185\u2019 could equally be an animal shed (A) or a straw store (T). In most of the cases across the sample, these two functions are found to occur in the same space. It is a strong possibility that, in this case, space \u20185\u2019 was a multi-functional space with more than one usage \u2013 that of an animal shed and a straw store. It could be conjectured that this space used to serve mainly as a straw store (T), as animals had a separate courtyard in this particular house. However, when a more protective shed was required, some animals could be kept in the straw store. syntactically unclear and Functionally clear examples (su + Fc) House 3 \u2013 single unknown: The house in Figure 17.3a is a typical example of a syntactically unclear yet functionally clear case. All the functions have been identified; however, it is not clear whether a second courtyard entrance used to exist in the original situation. Two possible situations arise: one that allows for the existence of a door and one that does not. In this case, labels do not change between options; however, the configuration, that is to say the graph, does. The justified permeability graphs are drawn for the two possible scenarios, and each has been subjected to spacesyntax analysis for the calculation of integration values separately. The character strings of integration values have been constructed in the next stage, which are both shown below the corresponding graphs in Figure 17.3a. The next step has been to test each option against the base data with the string-matching method. For this purpose, each string has been added one at a time to the base sample of forty-four clear houses and their similarity values have been calculated: 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples \u0018\u0018\u0018 Option 1: CCECSTKhAAPmr Option 2: CCCSTKAhAEPmr 0.821 0.782 with door without door Scenario 2 has a lower similarity value, which implies that it is unlikely that the house had another second courtyard entrance, as the string with single door is more similar to the rest of the sample. House 4 \u2013 more than one unknown: House 4 in Figure 17.3b is a case for multiple unclear situations in the syntactic layout. The original plan shown has been reconstructed from the current situation of the house (shown in Figure 17.4), which was modified to a great extent. All the courtyard spaces, which were left unused (as shown in grey in Figure 17.4), have been kept and are all physically standing with clear implications of their original uses. On the other hand, the traces of original passageways and arcades were easily identified (as marked by blue dotted lines), just as the recently built additions and partitions. Thus, from the current situation of House 4 (shown in Figure 17.4), its original layout (in Figure 17.3b) has been easily retrieved. However, there were a few points that could not be identified with great confidence. The main factor which is unclear about this house is the availability of the second courtyard, which is formed from spaces \u201817\u2019 and \u201818\u2019 in Figure 17.3b. This means that if the courtyard did not exist, the space was a public or outside space and the toilet and the access from kitchen to this exterior space could not exist. However, even if it is a public space, there could be an access from the main living room (space 3) to this outside space. Thus three scenarios arise: One is the situation as shown in Figure 17.3b, which has the second courtyard, all of the connections to it, and the toilet. A second is the one without the courtyard, the toilet, and the connections from kitchen and main living space to the outside space. The third scenario is same as the second except for the access from space \u20183\u2019 (main living) to the outside. Justified permeability graphs have been drawn for each scenario and the character strings have been constructed based on the integration values as calculated by the customary methods of space syntax. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton 17: The Spacial Morphology of Deficient Samples Figure 17.4. Current modified situation of House 4 in Figure 17.3b. \u0018\u0018\u0018 Option 1: CLKMTAAARCAECPAA 0.973 with second courtyard + toilet + connections from kitchen and main living 0.901 without second courtOption 2: CLKTAAAAMREAPA yard + toilet + connections from kitchen and main living Option 3: CLKTAAAMAERAPA 0.923 without second courtyard + toilet + connection from kitchen and with connection from main living to the outside In general, this case is found to be the most idiosyncratic when compared to the other forty-four cases in terms of its number of constituent spaces. However, it is not the type but the number of similar spaces that matters. Among the three scenarios, scenario 2 has the lowest similarity value; thus it is the most similar to the rest of the sample. This implies that it is unlikely that the house used to have a second courtyard in its original form and that it is unlikely that the \u2018main living space\u2019 was directly connected to the outside world. This exactly matches our subjective intuition, given our expert knowledge of the data set, as houses like this one, which represent earlier cases in the sample, are interior-oriented and are rarely directly connected to the outside world through their \u2018main living units.\u2019 Discussion and Conclusion String-matching has been applied to a small sample of unclear, traditional Cypriot houses with apparent success. Cases that are \u2018syntactically clear\u2019 and \u2018functionally unclear\u2019 seem the easiest to analyze as the spatial configuration and the resultant inequality string remains the same with possible function insertions (labels) being tested in turn. However, the situation gets more complicated for cases that are \u2018syntactically unclear\u2019 and \u2018functionally clear.\u2019 As this implies a change in the configuration, it requires conducting the space syntax analysis for each scenario to obtain the inequality string and then comparing each string to the base data, in turn. This problem of complexity even further increases with cases that are \u2018unclear\u2019 both \u2018syntactically\u2019 and \u2018functionally.\u2019 These cases have been omitted from the present study. This \u0018\u0018\u0018 Ciler Kirsan and Ruth Conroy Dalton would undoubtedly require constructing scenarios of strings for numerous permutations, which would dramatically increase the resultant test analysis as well. However, it should also be noted that the number of permutations generated mathematically for the unclear options could be reduced through the application of logic and expert knowledge. As an automated methodology \u2018spatial string-matching\u2019 can easily and effectively be applied to large samples. Given the encouraging results of its application to unclear cases presented in this paper, it is suggested that stringmatching can be applied, at least to an extent, with apparent success for the analysis of deficient samples and can be used by archaeologists to help them make valid inferences about any residual plans of their excavations. Considering the difficulties inherent in the application of syntactic analysis to imperfect and incomplete data sets, as already mentioned by most of the archaeologists, it is believed that the technique proposed here will provide a more reliable and convincing way to the application of quantitative access analysis of space syntax. In the absence of a well-recorded database, it is highly relevant to consider any kind of evidence present in a residual architecture. This paper has demonstrated the value of string-matching in interpreting and inferring the patterns in deficient, uncertain data in a detective manner through the combination of mathematical and expert knowledge.

Multimatch is a small program written in C language to analyze data by Conroy Dalton for her PhD studies. Gamma and alpha are the types of syntactical analyses provided for building interiors and settlements respectively which had been introduced in The Social Logic of Space. It is clear from this statement that permeability relations between labelled spaces are essential in space syntax analysis. Clearly a single act of substitution could be considered to be equivalent to an act of deletion followed by an act of insertion (or vice versa). Detailed information on string matching algorithm can be found in Conroy (2001). This is not metric distance. The labelled spaces in the plans are represented as follows: C = courtyard; c = animal courtyard; L = loggia; R = room; M = main room; K = kitchen; A = animal shed; E = exterior; m = upper main room; S = semi-closed central space/hallway; H = closed central space/hallway; P = produce store; T = straw store; h = upper closed central space/hallway; s = upper semi-closed central space/hallway; r = upper room; F = front garden; G = garage.

"Transplanting Roses\nYou can grow just about any roses in containers, window boxes and hanging baskets.\nJust about any rose can be grown long term in containers.\u00a0There are roses ideally suited to containers, including miniature roses and polyanthas.\u00a0Even shrub roses, rose standards, and small climbers can thrive in containers.\u00a0But the care you give and even the container you select will be very important to success.\nSun\nPotted roses are often used for patios, balconies or entryways, so make sure your roses receive a minimum of 6 hours of sun.\u00a0More sun is even better, but the sun can also heat up your container.\u00a0Planted in the ground roots are kept cool.\u00a0In warm climates, if your potted rose will receive a lot of sun, be cautious about the container you select and keep up with the watering.\u00a0The larger the container, the more soil you will have to keep the roots cooler.\u00a0Some rose varieties do better than others with only six hours of sun, so check the requirements for your selected rose.\u00a0Generally, the more petals a rose has, the more sun it will require to produce consistent blooming and large blooms.\nRose Selection\nThe mature size of your selection will be important in choosing a container.\u00a0A large shrub rose will require a huge container to maintain a healthy rose.\u00a0Many shrub roses respond well to shearing and severe pruning each year, which can help keep the shrub an appropriate size for your space and container.\u00a0Miniature roses and small Polyantha roses are excellent for smaller containers, window boxes or hanging baskets.\u00a0Polyantha roses and floribunda roses are\ngenerally a good size for larger containers.\u00a0Most of the shrub roses will require a very generous container.\nA continuous blooming or repeat blooming rose will keep your container looking good.\u00a0You may also want to select a rose that blooms on new wood if you expect to see much blooming in the first season.\u00a0If you select once blooming roses, you can certainly include other plants in your container.\u00a0Choose long blooming perennials or annuals that will give you color all season.\u00a0Also make sure your container is large enough to support the additional plants.\nContainer Selection\nYour roses will want plenty of soil for rooting space, and a lot of soil will hold a lot of water that your roses will also want.\u00a0So you must have a container large enough for the size of your rose.\u00a0Err on the generous size so the soil does not dry out too quickly.\nMiniature roses and probably the small polyantha roses will do fine in a 5 gallon container.\u00a0To give you an idea of the actual size, a 12 inch deep container that is 11 inches across will hold 5 gallons.\nSmaller floribundas, and many polyantha roses will be happy in a 10 gallon container.\u00a0A 16 inch deep container that is 14 inches across will hold ten gallons.\u00a0(Your medium garbage container under the kitchen sink is only 8 gallons, it should be bigger than that for your roses.)\nHybrid tea roses, large floribunda roses, grandiflora roses and small\nto medium sized shrub roses will need a 15 gallon container.\u00a0A 17 inch deep container that is 15 inches across will hold 15 gallons.\u00a0(Your tall kitchen garbage container in the closet is only 13 gallons, it should be larger than that for these roses.)\nLarge shrub roses (up to 5\u2019 high and wide) and climbers will need 20 to 30 gallon containers.\u00a0Something along the lines of a whiskey barrel should be about 30 gallons.\nClay planters are ideal for keeping your roots cooler in hot weather, but they are substantially heavier than the lightweight plastic and resin containers.\u00a0A 10 gallon planter is difficult too move if it is clay or pottery.\u00a0Clay and pottery pots can also crack in freezing temperatures.\u00a0Fortunately the new plastic planters are looking pretty good, some are hard to distinguish from pottery from any distance.\u00a0Choose a light to medium color, the darker color plastics heat up, drying out your soil and heating the roots too much.\u00a0Moving 15 to 30 gallon containers of any material will require 2 people, or place it on a base with wheels.\u00a0In cold climates you may be moving your containers into a shed, garage or in a sheltered corner to winterize the rose.\nMake sure, of course, that your pot has drainage holes.\u00a0No need to \u201cfill\u201d the bottom with gravel, styrofoam peanuts or any other \u201cdrainage\u201d material.\u00a0That\u2019s what the holes are for, and your filler will take valuable soils space away from your rose.\u00a0The larger the pot, the more holes that are needed.\u00a0Four holes at least for a 20 gallon pot, up to eight for a 30 gallon pot.\u00a0Whiskey and oak wine barrels will often have drainage holes, but will often \u201cweep\u201d also.\u00a0Side holes are best, if your holes are on the bottom you might want to raise the pot a bit with shims so the excess water can drain away easier.\u00a0The only reason to put anything in the bottom of your container is to add weight to keep a tall plant, a climber on a pillar for example, from blowing over.\u00a0Use an inch of builders sand if you are concerned about a windy location.\nSoil\nNever use garden soil in your planters.\u00a0Garden soil, or top soil, is very heavy, compacts easily and does not drain well.\u00a0Use a good quality potting soil.\u00a0Or mix your own with one third potting soil, one third aged compost, and one third composted manure.\u00a0Add one cup perlite to improve drainage.\u00a0You may also want to add to your purchased or mixed soil one cup of bone meal.\u00a0Blood meal or fishmeal may be added to increase nutrients.\nYou should replace the soil every three years or so.\u00a0Roses are very heavy feeders and will deplete the soil nutrients, fertilizer will not make up the difference.\u00a0They may also be a build up of soluble salts from the fertilizer after a few years.\u00a0This is also a good time to root prune if the plant is becoming root bound.\u00a0Simply trim back the roots, new ones will be replaced quickly.\nPlanting a Rose\nWhen planting a rose in a container, the bud union should be at or just above the soil line.\u00a0The rose will grow more vigorously if the bud union is not below the soil line.\u00a0If you plan to overwinter your rose outside in a cold climate, the bud union should be just below the soil line.\nFill the container about two thirds with prepared soil.\u00a0Create a soil mound in the center and place the rose over it, spreading the roots out carefully.\u00a0Fill with more soil and tamp the soil by pressing firmly, but gently with flat hands around the roots.\u00a0Continue filling the container and tamp lightly until the soil has reached the desired level of the bud union.\u00a0Ideally when you finish the soil will be fully to the top of the pot.\u00a0The soil will settle substantially with the first watering, and will continue to settle over time.\u00a0Cover the soil with spanish moss or other mulching material to prevent soil splash when you water.\u00a0Now completely saturate the soil until water runs from the drainage holes.\u00a0Use a light flow so as not to displace the mulch and create deep depressions in the soil.\u00a0The soil should be saturated slowly.\nWater and Fertilizer\nRegular watering and fertilizing will be critical to the health of your rose.\u00a0Insufficient watering or over watering will also result in inferior blooms.\u00a0Soil that dries out and becomes overheated (a dark colored plastic pot will accelerate the heating of the soil) will also result in inferior blooms.\nExpect to water your container every week, saturating the soil until water runs from the drainage holes.\u00a0Watering should be adjusted according to weather conditions.\u00a0Poke your finger into the soil about an inch.\u00a0If it feels dry, water.\u00a0If it is still moist, do not water yet.\u00a0Fertilize every week with a water soluble fertilizer mixed at one fourth the recommended strength.\u00a0It is very easy to \u201cburn\u201d container plants with heavy doses of fertilizer.\u00a0In the ground, there is a lot of soil to dilute heavy fertilizations.\nWinterizing Container Roses\nWinter conditions in any zone are unpredictable.\u00a0As a rule, your potted roses and rose trees should be kept in an environment above 25 degrees F, and ideally at 40 degrees, but not above 40-50 degrees or they will not go dormant.\u00a0Keep this in mind as you select a method to overwinter your container rose.\u00a0And do NOT prune roses in fall or growth will be encouraged.\u00a0Wait until very early spring when still dormant.\nAnd don\u2019t think that just because you potted a super hardy rose that it will survive winter in a container.\u00a0The soil in a container will freeze completely, whereas the ground will not.\u00a0A hardy rose loses 2 or 3 hardiness zones in a container.\u00a0In other words, a rose hardy in the ground to zone 3 will survive winter in a container without protection in zone 6, perhaps zone 5.\u00a0A very large container, and therefore a large amount of soil, will help.\u00a0It will take a longer period of consistantly subfreezing temperatures to freeze the soil.\nGenerally speaking, potted roses and tree roses of any type should be able to weather a zone 7 winter outside with minimal protection steps.\u00a0Stop fertilizing by the end of August or first week of September, but continue regular waterings right through winter.\u00a0Less and less water will be used through the winter, but keep checking the soil at least every 3 to 4 weeks, as you do not want the roots to dry out.\u00a0If at all possible, protect your rose from wind.\u00a0Place the pots in an area sheltered from northern winds, and preferably in the shade but definately out of the late afternoon sun.\u00a0The idea is to maintain a cold temperature so the rose remains dormant.\u00a0Your rose may not remain dormant if it becomes too warm in a sunny area.\u00a0A burlap wrap will help protect the rose or tree rose from both wind and sun, especially if the pot is so large that you cannot move it to a sheltered location.\u00a0Tie the wrap loosely in place.\u00a0If freezing weather is expected, move the pots up close to the foundation to benefit from the heat of the house, and add additional wrapping.\u00a0A temporary covering of a blanket, heavy sheet or plastic should protect the plant from freezing for a short period.\nTo prepare container roses for winter in zone 6, stop fertilizing by the end of August or the first week of September, but continue regular waterings right through winter.\u00a0Less and less water will be used throught the winter, but keep checking the soil at least every 3 to 4 weeks, as you do not want the roots to dry out.\u00a0If you plan to overwinter your container rose outside, they should be in plastic or wood containers.\u00a0Ceramic and terra cotta pots will crack if the endure freeze and thaw cycles.\u00a0Right after the first frost winter protection should be applied, usually middle or late November.\u00a0\u201cBury\u201d the entire pot in leaves or mulch.\u00a0Use some means of containing the mulching material, such as a chicken wire ring or a sack that allows air to flow such as burlap.\u00a0Or bring the container into a shed or unheated garage for the winter.\u00a0Be sure, however, that a garage stays cool enough to prevent the rose from growing.\u00a0And don\u2019t forget to water if you bring them inside, they tend to dry out more quickly in a closed shelter.\nIn zones 5 and colder, container roses must be either \u201cMinnesota tipped\u201d or brought into a shelter that does dip below 25 degrees F or above 40-50 degrees.\u00a0Put simply, you need to completely bury your rose.\u00a0This can be done pot and all, or you can dig out the rose and bury it bare root.\u00a0If you keep a vegetable garden, that provides the perfect spot to bury a rose in its\u2019 container.\u00a0Stop fertilizing around mid August, but continue regular waterings until the rose is buried.\u00a0About mid to late October after the first hard freeze, dig a hole and bury the pot or bare root rose.\u00a0The bud union should be at least six inches deep, burying the pot on its\u2019 side is fine and works well for a tree rose.\u00a0If you prefer to keep the plant and container \u201cclean\u201d for easier spring removal, wrap it all in burlap.\u00a0Once the ground has frozen, cover it with a thick layer of mulch to help maintain a constant soil temperature.\nIf your container rose can be stored in an unheated garage, be sure the temperature remains between 25 and 40-50 degrees F.\u00a0Even in zone 5, overnight temperatures in a garage may dip below 25 degrees.\u00a0 The rose and container should be entirely wrapped in a heavy blanket and stored up on blocks so it is not in contact with the very cold cement floor.\u00a0Place it in a corner that adjoins the heated house to borrow a little warmth.\u00a0Some gardeners in the most northern regions have even rigged a light bulb inside coverings to maintain minimal warmth.\u00a0Do use caution with such a method, making sure it is fire safe.\nIf you have an extremely large container that just cannot be buried or stored, do as much as you can to protect it.\u00a0Place it up against the heated wall of a house or patio door - we lose a lot of heat through glass and your rose will make good use of it.\u00a0Then heavily insulate the around the other three sides of the rose and container and hope for the best.\nWith proper care your roses can live their entire life in the container.\u00a0Should your roses grow much larger than expected, transplant into a larger pot.\n"}, {"score": 362.81866, "uuid":

In fact, if you are a mother already, you may have had fun with your little girl by putting blush, lipstick, and even mascara on her to play \"dress-up\".\nHowever, more and more research is uncovering that over-the-counter cosmetics are full of harmful, toxic chemicals that can store up in your body to cause long-term damage.\nIs your daughter at risk?\nIn a recent study conducted by the Environmental Working Group, 20 teenage girls between the ages of 14 to 19 had their blood and urine tested to detect whether or not 25 of the most common chemicals in cosmetics were present. All of these teenage girls lived in different areas of the US and came from different ethnic backgrounds. The results of the tests showed an AVERAGE of 13 hormone-altering chemicals present in their bodies.\nThese chemicals are normally found in beauty care and makeup products, and the girls within the study used roughly 17 different personal care products that had over 174 chemical ingredients in them.\nThese over-the-counter cosmetic chemicals found in their bodies were linked with hormone disruption and even cancer, as well as other side effects, like reproductive development issues, an increased risk of asthma, thyroid problems, and impaired fertility.\nFor this reason, EWG scientists strongly recommend that you avoid ingredients in your beauty products, like fragrances, dyes, parabens, TEA, PEG, sodium laurel, and chemicals that end in \u201ceth\u201d. As a rule of thumb, it is often best to steer clear of cosmetic ingredients that are impossible to pronounce and sound like a laboratory experiment! Why would you want to put that on your skin?\nIn addition to choosing beauty products that are safe for you and your daughter to use, you also must put thought into the possible risk of toxins in your home.\nDid you know that there are over 150 toxic chemicals lurking in your home?\nEach day, we are all exposed to toxic chemicals in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.

Container plantings are perfect for gardeners with limited outdoor space, and they're great for making entrances, decks, and patios feel more welcoming.\nTraditionally, containers gardens are designed with annuals, using something tall in the back, a trailing plant in the front, and a medium height plant with colorful flowers in the center. These mixed containers look fantastic, but lately I've been looking for a new formula.\nThis is because except for driving a Hummer, to me nothing says pre-recession like a big container of expensive annuals that have to be replaced several times a year. These displays aren't seen that often anymore, and when I come across them I have a flashback to 2007 and the pre-Lehmann Brothers, pre-Bernie Madoff days.\nThe past few years I've been experimenting with containers filled mostly with plants I've divided from my garden, and while the effect may be subtle, it can be very effective. A big benefit here is that perennials and even shrubs in containers will overwinter and come back bigger and better in subsequent years.\nThe key is to choose plants for their foliage, not their flowers. Most perennials have a short bloom season, so the leaves need to hold the interest for the rest of the year. Interesting hostas are great in containers, as are heucheras. I plunked one of each into two containers on my neighbor's shady landing a few years ago and they're still going strong and look great. I'm not sure she's ever watered them.\nYou can also try evergreens as an anchor in your containers, and fill in with some small plants seasonally. I have a dwarf Japanese pine tree in a big pot that looks good all year, especially in winter, and another pot planted with a 'Sky Pencil' Japanese holly with space around it for annuals (I do still like annuals, even if I don't use them that much.)\nHouseplants like fancy-leaved geraniums and different succulents can also work in outside containers. Stems of both these can be snapped off the parent plant and stuck directly in the dirt, where they will form roots quickly. A few weeks ago I filled a big copper kettle from a flea market with soil and planted the top with jade plants, aloe, sedums, and echeverias that had been in different pots in the house during the winter. They should fill in soon, and next fall I'll pull them out and bring them back inside again.\nHaving almost exhausted the topic and the reader here, I'll just add that lastly, it's worth considering that the container makes as much of an impact as what's inside it. Using a cheap plastic planter is fine, but you may want something more attractive and more permanent like terra cotta, ceramic, or metal, all of which should last for many years. If you browse yard sales, flea markets and thrift shops you might find some good deals and unique containers to use as planters.\nOddly, it's actually been more fun to design containers using what I already have in the ground and in the house than what I find in the store. Maybe we should start a movement, and call it recession gardening.\n"}, {"score": 349.93625, "uuid": "c5999570-60fe-5af7-a3b1-acdf02d4f362", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600tw-38-12775", "target_hostname": "www.yakima-herald.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yakima-herald.com/stories/2012/02/25/mclain-growing-citrus-trees-indoors-takes-special-care", "page_rank": 1.1823265e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "McLain | Growing citrus trees indoors takes special care | Yakima", "snippet": "The root size will determine the size <em>of</em> the <em>pot</em> you need -- roots need room to grow for at least two years without becoming root bound.

You have probably seen these cute little trees pictured in ads in magazines and newspapers that are laden with fruit promising that you can. And it's true -- if you can meet the conditions that they need.\nIn as little as three or four years after starting your dwarf citrus tree, you can be picking ripe lemons, oranges, limes or other kinds of citrus fruits. (While you can be successful in growing small citrus trees indoors from seeds, don't expect them to ever bloom and produce fruit.)\nIf you would like to give growing a citrus tree a try, first inquire if local nurseries will sell potted dwarf citrus trees this spring. If not, you can look through that stack of seed catalogs that has been piling up on your coffee table. You will find dwarf citrus trees listed in the Gurney, Stark Bros. and Raintree Nursery catalogs, and probably others. You will find potted trees in some of the larger nurseries in the Seattle area. Or you can go online, where you will find scads of nurseries selling bare-rooted or potted dwarf citrus trees.\nAlways check to see if the citrus trees being advertised are potted or bare-rooted. Potted trees will cost you anywhere from $15 to over $100 each, depending on the variety, size and age. Bare-rooted trees may be one year to three year plants; the cost will depend on the age of the starts, and they cost as little as $5.\nIf you buy bare-rooted stock, your first task will be choosing the right sized pot. The root size will determine the size of the pot you need -- roots need room to grow for at least two years without becoming root bound. The first pot should be at least 9 inches in diameter. Terra cotta, plastic or ceramic pots will work. Every two or three years, depending on how fast your tree grows, you will need to transplant it into the next sized pot. Starting out with a very large pot will not work as well as graduating your plant to increasing larger pots as they grow.\nUnless you buy a tree already potted, you will need to buy a top-grade commercial potting soil that has very good drainage. Excellent drainage is essential for successfully getting your tree to bear fruit.\nLike many of your other house plants, dwarf citrus benefit from being moved outdoors in summer. When outdoor night temperatures are consistently in the mid-50s or higher, it's time to move them outdoors. Accustom your tree to the outdoors gradually. Start by placing it where it will be shaded all day. Then gradually move your tree where it will receive more and more direct sunlight. Reverse the process in late summer or early fall to prepare your tree to be brought back indoors.\nPlanting, caring and harvesting\nIndoor sunlight is another crucial factor. Dwarf citrus trees need at least six hours of sunlight, and eight to 10 hours is ever better. A room with a southern or southwestern exposure is ideal. If you haven't a room with that much direct sunlight, you can still grow citrus successfully under grow lights that are kept on for up to 12 hours a day.\nCitrus trees grow best indoors with 65-degree days and with night temperatures that don't drop below 55 degrees. Daytime temperatures in the low 70s should not pose a big problem. But they won't grow with temperatures below 50 degrees, and less than 40 degrees can cause their demise.\nHumidity in our homes usually isn't over 20 percent, but citrus trees need humidity that is at least 30 percent or somewhat higher. As with most of house plants, you will need to raise the humidity. The best option is to set up a humidifier near your house plants. A less expensive way is to set all of your house plants, including your citrus tree, on saucers partly filled with pebbles and water. Grouped fairly close together, all of them should thrive.\nFertilize your citrus tree once a month with a balanced 20-10-10 fertilizer, but only when it is actively growing from May through August. Whether you use a chemical or organic fertilizer, use one that is higher in nitrogen than phosphorous and potassium.\nThere are a few pests that can be troublesome, including aphids, scale and spider mites. Monitor both the tops and undersides of the leaves frequently and eradicate pests before they become well established. You can usually remove a small scale colony by scrapping them off with your thumbnail. Smothering scale with summer horticultural oil will also do the trick.\nSmall numbers of aphids can be squished between your fingers, killed by using a Q-tip dipped in alcohol or sprayed with insecticidal soap. Miticides are not a good idea for use indoors. Because mites are so small, you may need to use a magnifying glass to detect them. They can often be removed by washing them off with tepid water, but you will need to repeat the process every few days to finally get rid of them. Generally, insects are not a big problem indoors. Be sure to monitor your citrus tree carefully when you bring it back indoors in early fall.\nPollination can be a problem indoors because of the lack of pollinating insects. You will need to be the pollinator. Some growers have luck by gently shaking the tree when it is blooming. Others hand pollinate by using a Q-Tip or artist paintbrush to transfer pollen from one blossom to another. You will need to play the part of a bee whenever your tree is indoors.\nWhen to begin harvest is best determined by trial-and-error, at least when you first begin growing citrus fruit.

Watts Foreword by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert \"To the People of Druid Heights\" Contents Foreword Preface Prologue The Joyous Cosmology Epilog The Joyous Cosmology \u00a91962 by Pantheon Books, a division of Random House. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Foreword ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- The Joyous Cosmology is a brilliant arrangement of words describing experiences for which our language has no vocabulary. To understand this wonderful but difficult book it is useful to make the artificial distinction between the external and the internal. This is, of course, exactly the distinction which Alan Watts wants us to transcend. But Mr. Watts is playing the verbal game in a Western language, and his reader can be excused for following along with conventional dichotomous models. External and internal. Behavior and consciousness. Changing the external world has been the genius and the obsession of our civilization. In the last two centuries the Western monotheistic cultures have faced outward and moved objects about with astonishing efficiency. In more recent years, however, our culture has become aware of a disturbing imbalance. We have become aware of the undiscovered universe within, of the uncharted regions of consciousness. This dialectic trend is not new. The cycle has occurred in the lives of many cultures and individuals. External material success is followed by disillusion and the basic \"why\" questions, and then by the discovery of the world within---a world infinitely more complex and rich than the artifactual structures of the outer world, which after all are, in origin, projections of human imagination. Eventually, the logical conceptual mind turns on itself, recognizes the foolish inadequacy of the flimsy systems it imposes on the world, suspends its own rigid control, and overthrows the domination of cognitive experience. We speak here (and Alan Watts speaks in this book) about the politics of the nervous system---certainly as complicated and certainly as important as external politics. The politics of the nervous system involves the mind against the brain, the tyrannical verbal brain disassociating itself from the organism and world of which it is a part, censoring, alerting, evaluating. Thus appears the fifth freedom---freedom from the learned, cultural mind. The freedom to expand one's consciousness beyond artifactual cultural knowledge. The freedom to move from constant preoccupation with the verbal games---the social games, the game of self---to the joyous unity of what exists beyond. We are dealing here with an issue that is not new, an issue that has been considered for centuries by mystics, by philosophers of the religious experience, by those rare and truly great scientists who have been able to move in and then out beyond the limits of the science game. It was seen and described clearly by the great American psychologist William James: . . . our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question,-for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge toward a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. But what are the stimuli necessary and sufficient to overthrow the domination of the conceptual and to open up the \"potential forms of consciousness\"? There are many. Indian philosophers have described hundreds of methods. So have the Japanese Buddhists. The monastics of our Western religions provide more examples. Mexican healers and religious leaders from South and North American Indian groups have for centuries utilized sacred plants to trigger off the expansion of consciousness. Recently our Western science has provided, in the form of chemicals, the most direct techniques for opening new realms of awareness. William James used nitrous oxide and ether to \"stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree.\" Today the attention of psychologists, philosophers, and theologians is centering on the effects of three synthetic substances---mescaline, lysergic acid, and psilocybin. What are these substances? Medicines or drugs or sacramental foods? It is easier to say what they are not. They are not narcotics, nor intoxicants, nor energizers, nor anaesthetics, nor tranquilizers. They are, rather, biochemical keys which unlock experiences shatteringly new to most Westerners. For the last two years, staff members of the Center for Research in Personality at Harvard University have engaged in systematic experiments with these substances. Our first inquiry into the biochemical expansion of consciousness has been a study of the reactions of Americans in a supportive, comfortable naturalistic setting. We have had the opportunity of participating in over one thousand individual administrations. From our observations, from interviews and reports, from analysis of questionnaire data, and from pre- and postexperimental differences in personality test results, certain conclusions have emerged. (I) These substances do alter consciousness. There is no dispute on this score. (2) It is meaningless to talk more specifically about the \"effect of the drug.\" Set and setting, expectation, and atmosphere account for all specificity of reaction. There is no \"drug reaction\" but always setting-plus-drug. (3) In talking about potentialities it is useful to consider not just the setting-plus-drug but rather the potentialities of the human cortex to create images and experiences far beyond the narrow limitations of words and concepts. Those of us on this research project spend a good share of our working hours listening to people talk about the effect and use of consciousness-altering drugs. If we substitute the words human cortex for drug we can then agree with any statement made about the potentialities---for good or evil, for helping or hurting, for loving or fearing. Potentialities of the cortex, not of the drug. The drug is just an instrument. In analyzing and interpreting the results of our studies we looked first to the conventional models of modern psychology---psychoanalytic, behaviorist---and found these concepts quite inadequate to map the richness and breadth of expanded consciousness. To understand our findings we have finally been forced back on a language and point of view quite alien to us who are trained in the traditions of mechanistic objective psychology. We have had to return again and again to the nondualistic conceptions of Eastern philosophy, a theory of mind made more explicit and familiar in our Western world by Bergson, Aldous Huxley, and Alan Watts. In the first part of this book Mr. Watts presents with beautiful clarity this theory of consciousness, which we have seen confirmed in the accounts of our research subjects--- philosophers, unlettered convicts, housewives, intellectuals, alcoholics. The leap across entangling thickets of the verbal, to identify with the totality of the experienced, is a phenomenon reported over and over by these persons. Alan Watts spells out in eloquent detail his drug-induced visionary moments. He is, of course, attempting the impossible---to describe in words (which always lie) that which is beyond words. But how well he can do it! Alan Watts is one of the great reporters of our times. He has an intuitive sensitivity for news, for the crucial issues and events of the century. And he has along with this the verbal equipment of a poetic philosopher to teach and inform. Here he has given us perhaps the best statement on the subject of space-age mysticism, more daring than the two classic works of Aldous Huxley because Watts follows Mr. Huxley's lead and pushes beyond. The recognition of the love aspects of the mystical experience and the implications for new forms of social communication are especially important. You are holding in your hand a great human document. But unless you are one of the few Westerners who have (accidentally or through chemical good fortune) experienced a mystical minute of expanded awareness, you will probably not understand what the author is saying. Too bad, but still not a cause for surprise. The history of ideas reminds us that new concepts and new visions have always been non-understood. We cannot understand that for which we have no words. But Alan Watts is playing the book game, the word game, and the reader is his contracted partner. But listen. Be prepared. There are scores of great lines in this book. Dozens of great ideas. Too many. Too compressed. They glide by too quickly. Watch for them. If you catch even n few of these ideas, you will find yourself asking the questions which we ask ourselves as we look over our research data: Where do we go from here? What is the application of these new wonder medicines? Can they do more than provide memorable moments and memorable books? The answer will come from two directions. We must provide more and more people with these experiences and have them tell us, as Alan Watts does here, what they experienced. (There will hardly be a lack of volunteers for this ecstatic voyage. Ninety-one percent of our subjects are eager to repeat and to share the experience with their family and friends). We must also encourage systematic objective research by scientists who have taken the drug themselves and have come to know the difference between inner and outer, between consciousness and behavior. Such research should explore the application of these experiences to the problems of modern living---in education, religion, creative industry, creative arts. There are many who believe that we stand at an important turning point in man's power to control and expand his awareness. Our research provides tentative grounds for such optimism. The Joyous Cosmology is solid testimony for the same happy expectations. Timothy Leary, Ph.D.---Richard Alpert, Ph.D. Harvard University, January, 1962 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Preface ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- In The Doors of Perception Aldous Huxley has given us a superbly written account of the effects of mescaline upon a highly sensitive person. It was a record of his first experience of this remarkable transformation of consciousness, and by now, through subsequent experiments, he knows that it can lead to far deeper insights than his book described. While I cannot hope to surpass Aldous Huxley as a master of English prose, I feel that the time is ripe for an account of some of the deeper, or higher, levels of insight that can be reached through these consciousness-changing \"drugs\" when accompanied with sustained philosophical reflection by a person who is in search, not of kicks, but of understanding. I should perhaps add that, for me, philosophical reflection is barren when divorced from poetic imagination, for we proceed to understanding of the world upon two legs, not one. It is now a commonplace that there is a serious lack of communication between scientists and laymen on the theoretical level, for the layman does not understand the mathematical language in which the scientist thinks. For example, the concept of curved space cannot be represented in any image that is intelligible to the senses. But I am still more concerned with the gap between theoretical description and direct experience among scientists themselves. Western science is now delineating a new concept of man, not as a solitary ego within a wall of flesh, but as an organism which is what it is by virtue of its inseparability from the rest of the world. But with the rarest exceptions even scientists do not feel themselves to exist in this way. They, and almost all of us, retain a sense of personality which is independent, isolated, insular, and estranged from the cosmos that surrounds it. Somehow this gap must be closed, and among the varied means whereby the closure may be initiated or achieved are medicines which science itself has discovered, and which may prove to be the sacraments of its religion. For a long time we have been accustomed to the compartmentalization of religion and science as if they were two quite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing the world. I do not believe that this state of doublethink can last. It must eventually be replaced by a view of the world which is neither religious nor scientific but simply our view of the world. More exactly, it must become a view of the world in which the reports of science and religion are as concordant as those of the eyes and the ears. But the traditional roads to spiritual experience seldom appeal to persons of scientific or skeptical temperament, for the vehicles that ply them are rickety and piled with excess baggage. There is thus little opportunity for the alert and critical thinker to share at first hand in the modes of consciousness that seers and mystics are trying to express-often in archaic and awkward symbolism. If the pharmacologist can be of help in exploring this unknown world, he may be doing us the extraordinary service of rescuing religious experience from the obscurantists. To make this book as complete an expression as possible of the quality of consciousness which these drugs induce, I have included a number of photographs which, in their vivid reflection of the patterns of nature, give some suggestion of the rhythmic beauty of detail which the drugs reveal in common things. For without losing their normal breadth of vision the eyes seem to become a microscope through which the mind delves deeper and deeper into the intricately dancing texture of our world. Alan W. Watts San Francisco, 1962 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Prologue ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- SLOWLY it becomes clear that one of the greatest of all superstitions is the separation of the mind from the body. This does not mean that we are being forced to admit that we are only bodies; it means that we are forming an altogether new idea of the body. For the body considered as separate from the mind is one thing---an animated corpse. But the body considered as inseparable from the mind is another, and as yet we have no proper word for a reality which is simultaneously mental and physical. To call it mental-physical will not do at all, for this is the very unsatisfactory joining of two concepts which have both been impoverished by long separation and opposition. But we are at least within sight of being able to discard altogether ideas of a stuff which is mental and a stuff which is material. \"Stuff\" is a word which describes the formless mush that we perceive when sense is not keen enough to make out its pattern. The notion of material or mental stuff is based on the false analogy that trees are made of wood, mountains of stone, and minds of spirit in the same way that pots are made of clay. \"Inert\" matter seems to require an external and intelligent energy to give it form. But now we know that matter is not inert. Whether it is organic or inorganic, we are learning to see matter as patterns of energy---not of energy as if energy were a stuff, but as energetic pattern, moving order, active intelligence. The realization that mind and body, form and matter, are one is blocked, however, by ages of semantic confusion and psychological prejudice. For it is common sense that every pattern, shape, or structure is a form of something as pots are forms of clay. It is hard to see that this \"something\" is as dispensable as the ether in which light was once supposed to travel, or as the fabulous tortoise upon which the earth was once thought to be supported. Anyone who can really grasp this point will experience a curiously exhilarating liberation, for the burden of stuff will drop from him and he will walk less heavily. The dualism of mind and body arose, perhaps, as a clumsy way of describing the power of an intelligent organism to control itself. It seemed reasonable to think of the part controlled as one thing and the part controlling as another. In this way the conscious will was opposed to the involuntary appetites and reason to instinct. In due course we learned to center our identity, our selfhood, in the controlling part---the mind--- and increasingly to disown as a mere vehicle the part controlled. It thus escaped our attention that the organism as a whole, largely unconscious, was using consciousness and reason to inform and control itself. We thought of our conscious intelligence as descending from a higher realm to take possession of a physical vehicle. We therefore failed to see it as an operation of the same formative process as the structure of nerves, muscles, veins, and bones---a structure so subtly ordered (that is, intelligent) that conscious thought is as yet far from being able to describe it. This radical separation of the part controlling from the part controlled changed man from a self-controlling to a self- frustrating organism, to the embodied conflict and self-contradiction that he has been throughout his known history. Once the split occurred conscious intelligence began to serve its own ends instead of those of the organism that produced it. More exactly, it became the intention of the conscious intelligence to work for its own, dissociated, purposes. But, as we shall see, just as the separation of mind from body is an illusion, so also is the subjection of the body to the independent schemes of the mind. Meanwhile, however, the illusion is as real as the hallucinations of hypnosis, and the organism of man is indeed frustrating itself by patterns of behavior which move in the most complex vicious circles. The culmination is a culture which ever more serves the ends of mechanical order as distinct from those of organic enjoyment, and which is bent on self-destruction against the instinct of every one of its members. We believe, then, that the mind controls the body, not that the body controls itself through the mind. Hence the ingrained prejudice that the mind should be independent of all physical aids to its working---despite microscopes, telescopes, cameras, scales, computers, books, works of art, alphabets, and all those physical tools apart from which it is doubtful whether there would be any mental life at all. At the same time there has always been at least an obscure awareness that in feeling oneself to be a separate mind, soul, or ego there is something wrong. Naturally, for a person who finds his identity in something other than his full organism is less than half a man. He is cut off from complete participation in nature. Instead of being a body he \"has\" a body. Instead of living and loving he \"has\" instincts for survival and copulation. Disowned, they drive him as if they were blind furies or demons that possessed him. The feeling that there is something wrong in all this revolves around a contradiction characteristic of all civilizations. This is the simultaneous compulsion to preserve oneself and to forget oneself. Here is the vicious circle: if you feel separate from your organic life, you feel driven to survive; survival---going on living---thus becomes a duty and also a drag because you are not fully with it; because it does not quite come up to expectations, you continue to hope that it will, to crave for more time, to feel driven all the more to go on. What we call self-consciousness is thus the sensation of the organism obstructing itself, of not being with itself, of driving, so to say, with accelerator and brake on at once. Naturally, this is a highly unpleasant sensation, which most people want to forget. The lowbrow way of forgetting oneself is to get drunk, to be diverted with entertainments, or to exploit such natural means of self-transcendence as sexual intercourse. The highbrow way is to throw oneself into the pursuit of the arts, of social service, or of religious mysticism. These measures are rarely successful because they do not disclose the basic error of the split self. The highbrow ways even aggravate the error to the extent that those who follow them take pride in forgetting themselves by purely mental means---even though the artist uses paints or sounds, the social idealist distributes material wealth, and the religionist uses sacraments and rituals, or such other physical means as fasting, yoga breathing, or dervish dancing. And there is a sound instinct in the use of these physical aids, as in the repeated insistence of mystics that to know about God is not enough: transformation of the self is only through realizing or feeling God. The hidden point is that man cannot function properly through changing anything so superficial as the order of his thoughts, of his dissociated mind. What has to change is the behavior of his organism; it has to become self-controlling instead of self-frustrating. How is this to be brought about? Clearly, nothing can be done by the mind, by the conscious will, so long as this is felt to be something apart from the total organism. But if it were felt otherwise, nothing would need to be done! A very small number of Eastern gurus, or masters of wisdom, and Western psychotherapists have found---rather laborious---ways of tricking or coaxing the organism into integrating itself---mostly by a kind of judo, or \"gentle way,\" which overthrows the process of self-frustration by carrying it to logical and absurd extremes. This is pre-eminently the way of Zen, and occasionally that of psychoanalysis. When these ways work it is quite obvious that something more has happened to the student or patient than a change in his way of thinking; he is also emotionally and physically different; his whole being is operating in a new way. For a long time it has been clear to me that certain forms of Eastern \"mysticism\"---in particular Taoism and Zen Buddhism---do not presuppose a universe divided into the spiritual and the material, and do not culminate in a state of consciousness where the physical world vanishes into some undifferentiated and bodiless luminescence. Taoism and Zen are alike founded upon a philosophy of relativity, but this philosophy is not merely speculative. It is a discipline in awareness as a result of which the mutual interrelation of all things and all events becomes a constant sensation. This sensation underlies and supports our normal awareness of the world as a collection of separate and different things---an awareness which, by itself, is called avidya (ignorance) in Buddhist philosophy because, in paying exclusive attention to differences, it ignores relationships. It does not see, for example, that mind and form or shape and space are as inseparable as front and back, nor that the individual is so interwoven with the universe that he and it are one body. This is a point of view which, unlike some other forms of mysticism, does not deny physical distinctions but sees them as the plain expression of unity. As one sees so clearly in Chinese painting, the individual tree or rock is not on but with the space that forms its background. The paper untouched by the brush is an integral part of the picture and never mere backing. It is for this reason that when a Zen master is asked about the universal or the ultimate, he replies with the immediate and particular--- \"The cypress tree in the yard!\" Here, then, we have what Robert Linssen has called a spiritual materialism---a standpoint far closer to relativity and field theory in modern science than to any religious supernaturalism. But whereas the scientific comprehension of the relative universe is as yet largely theoretical, these Eastern disciplines have made it a direct experience. Potentially, then, they would seem to offer a marvelous parallel to Western science, but on the level of our immediate awareness of the world. For science pursues the common-sense assumption that the natural world is a multiplicity of individual things and events by attempting to describe these units as accurately and minutely as possible. Because science is above all analytic in its way of describing things, it seems at first to disconnect them more than ever. Its experiments are the study of carefully isolated situations, designed to exclude influences that cannot be measured and controlled---as when one studies falling bodies in a vacuum to cut out the friction of air. But for this reason the scientist understands better than anyone else just how inseparable things are. The more he tries to cut out external influences upon an experimental situation, the more he discovers new ones, hitherto unsuspected. The more carefully he describes, say, the motion of a given particle, the more he finds himself describing also the space in which it moves. The realization that all things are inseparably related is in proportion to one's effort to make them clearly distinct. Science therefore surpasses the common-sense point of view from which it begins, coming to speak of things and events as properties of the \"fields\" in which they occur. But this is simply a theoretical description of a state of affairs which, in these forms of Eastern Mysticism,\" is directly sensed. As soon as this is clear, we have a sound basis for a meeting of minds between East and West which could be remarkably fruitful. The practical difficulty is that Taoism and Zen are so involved with the forms of Far Eastern culture that it is a major problem to adapt them to Western needs. For example, Eastern teachers work on the esoteric and aristocratic principle that the student must learn the hard way and find out almost everything for himself. Aside from occasional hints, the teacher merely accepts or rejects the student's attainments. But Western teachers work on the exoteric and democratic principle that everything possible must be done to inform and assist the student so as to make his mastery of the subject as easy as possible. Does the latter approach, as purists insist, merely vulgarize the discipline? The answer is that it depends upon the type of discipline. If everyone learns enough mathematics to master quadratic equations, the attainment will seem small in comparison with the much rarer comprehension of the theory of numbers. But the transformation of consciousness undertaken in Taoism and Zen is more like the correction of faulty perception or the curing of a disease. It is not an acquisitive process of learning more and more facts or greater and greater skills, but rather an unlearning of wrong habits and opinions. As Lao-tzu said, \"The scholar gains every day, but the Taoist loses every day.\" The practice of Taoism or Zen in the Far East is therefore an undertaking in which the Westerner will find himself confronted with many barriers erected quite deliberately to discourage idle curiosity or to nullify wrong views by inciting the student to proceed systematically and consistently upon false assumptions to the reductio ad absurdum. My own main interest in the study of comparative mysticism has been to cut through these tangles and to identify the essential psychological processes underlying those alterations of perception which enable us to see ourselves and the world in their basic unity. I have perhaps had some small measure of success in trying, Western fashion, to make this type of experience more accessible. I am therefore at once gratified and embarrassed by a development in Western science which could possibly put this unitive vision of the world, by almost shockingly easy means, within the reach of many who have thus far sought it in vain by traditional methods. Part of the genius of Western science is that it finds simpler and more rational ways of doing things that were formerly chancy or laborious. Like any inventive process, it does not always make these discoveries systematically; often it just stumbles upon them, but then goes on to work them into an intelligible order. In medicine, for example, science isolates the essential drug from the former witch-doctor's brew of salamanders, mugwort, powdered skulls, and dried blood. The purified drug cures more surely, but---it does not perpetuate health. The patient still has to change habits of life or diet which made him prone to the disease. Is it possible, then, that Western science could provide a medicine which would at least give the human organism a start in releasing itself from its chronic self-contradiction? The medicine might indeed have to be supported by other procedures---psychotherapy, \"spiritual\" disciplines, and basic changes in one's pattern of life---but every diseased person seems to need some kind of initial lift to set him on the way to health. The question is by no means absurd if it is true that what afflicts us is a sickness not just of the mind but of the organism, of the very functioning of the nervous system and the brain. Is there, in short, a medicine which can give us temporarily the sensation of being integrated, of being fully one with ourselves and with nature as the biologist knows us, theoretically, to be? If so, the experience might offer clues to whatever else must be done to bring about full and continuous integration. It might be at least the tip of an Ariadne's thread to lead us out of the maze in which all of us are lost from our infancy. Relatively recent research suggests that there are at least three such medicines, though none is an infallible \"specific.\" They work with some people, and much depends upon the social and psychological context in which they are given. Occasionally their effects may be harmful, but such limitations do not deter us from using penicillin---often a far more dangerous chemical than any of these three. I am speaking, of course, of mescaline (the active ingredient of the peyote cactus), lysergic acid diethylamide (a modified ergot alkaloid), and psilocybin (a derivative of the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana). The peyote cactus has long been used by the Indians of the Southwest and Mexico as a means of communion with the divine world, and today the eating of the dried buttons of the plant is the principal sacrament of an Indian church known as the Native American Church of the United States ---by all accounts a most respectable and Christian organization. At the end of the nineteenth century its effects were first described by Weir Mitchell and Havelock Ellis, and some years later its active ingredient was identified as mescaline, a chemical of the amine group which is quite easily synthesized. Lysergic acid diethylamide was first discovered in 1938 by the Swiss pharmacologist A. Hofmann in the course of studying the properties of the ergot fungus. Quite by accident he absorbed a small amount of this acid while making certain changes in its molecular structure, and noticed its peculiar psychological effects. Further research proved that he had hit upon the most powerful consciousness-changing drug now known, for LSD-25 (as it is called for short) will produce its characteristic results in so minute a dosage as 20 micrograms, 1/700,000,000 of an average man's weight. Psilocybin is derived from another of the sacred plants of the Mexican Indians---a type of mushroom known to them as teonanacatl, \"the flesh of God.\" Following Robert Weitlaner's discovery in 1936 that the cult of \"the sacred mushroom\" was still prevalent in Oaxaca, a number of mycologists, as specialists in mushrooms are known, began to make studies of the mushrooms of this region. Three varieties were found to be in use. In addition to Psilocybe mexicana there were also Psilocybe aztecorum Heim and Psilocybe wassonii, named respectively after the mycologists Roger Heim and Gordon and Valentina Wasson, who took part in the ceremonies of the cult. Despite a very considerable amount of research and speculation, little is known of the exact physiological effect of these chemicals upon the nervous system. The subjective effects of all three tend to be rather similar, though LSD-25, perhaps because of the minute dosage required, seldom produces the nauseous reactions so often associated with the other two. All the scientific papers I have read seem to add up to the vague impression that in some way these drugs suspend certain inhibitory or selective processes in the nervous system so as to render our sensory apparatus more open to impressions than is usual. Our ignorance of the precise effect of these drugs is, of course, linked to the still rather fumbling state of our knowledge of the brain. Such ignorance obviously suggests great caution in their use, but thus far there is no evidence that, in normal dosage, there is any likelihood of physiological damage.* In a very wide sense of the word, each of these substances is a drug, but one must avoid the serious semantic error of confusing them with drugs which induce physical craving for repeated use or which dull the senses like alcohol or the sedatives. They are classed, officially, as hallucinogens---an astonishingly inaccurate term, since they cause one neither to hear voices nor to see visions such as might be confused with physical reality. While they do indeed produce the most complex and very obviously \"hallucinatory\" patterns before closed eyes, their general effect is to sharpen the senses to a supernormal degree of awareness. The standard dosage of each substance maintains its effects for from five to eight hours, and the experience is often so deeply revealing and moving that one hesitates to approach it again until it has been thoroughly \"digested,\" and this may be a matter of months. The reaction of most cultured people to the idea of gaining any deep psychological or philosophical insight through a drug is that it is much too simple, too artificial, and even too banal to be seriously considered. A wisdom which can be \"turned on\" like the switch of a lamp seems to insult human dignity and degrade us to chemical automata. One calls to mind pictures of a brave new world in which there is a class of synthesized Buddhas, of people who have been \"fixed\" like the lobotomized, the sterilized, or the hypnotized, only in another direction---people who have somehow lost their humanity and with whom, as with drunkards, one cannot really communicate. This is, however, a somewhat ghoulish fantasy which has no relation to the facts or to the experience itself. It belongs to the same kind of superstitious dread which one feels for the unfamiliar, confusing it with the unnatural---the way some people feel about Jews because they are circumcised or even about Negroes because of their \"alien\" features and color. Despite the widespread and undiscriminating prejudice against drugs as such, and despite the claims of certain religious disciplines to be the sole means to genuine mystical insight, I can find no essential difference between the experiences induced, under favorable conditions, by these chemicals and the states of \"cosmic consciousness\" recorded by R. M. Bucke, William James, Evelyn Underhill, Raynor Johnson, and other investigators of mysticism. \"Favorable conditions\" means a setting which is socially and physically congenial; ideally this would be some sort of retreat house (not a hospital or sanitarium) supervised by religiously oriented psychiatrists or psychologists. The atmosphere should be homelike rather than clinical, and it is of the utmost importance that the supervisor's attitude be supportive and sympathetic. Under insecure, bizarre, or unfriendly circumstances the experience can easily degenerate into a highly unpleasant paranoia. Two days should be set aside---one for the experience itself, which lasts for six or eight hours, and one for evaluation in the calm and relaxed frame of mind that normally follows. This is simply to say that the use of such powerful medicines is not to be taken lightly, as one smokes a cigarette or tosses down a cocktail. They should be approached as one approaches a sacrament, though not with the peculiar inhibition of gaiety and humor that has become customary in our religious rituals. It is a sound general rule that there should always be present some qualified supervisor to provide a point of contact with \"reality\" as it is socially defined. Ideally the \"qualified supervisor\" should be a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who has himself experienced the effects of the drug, though I have observed that many who are technically qualified have a frightened awe of unusual states of consciousness which is apt to communicate itself, to the detriment of the experience, to those under their care. The most essential qualification of the supervisor is, therefore, confidence in the situation---which is likewise \"picked up\" by people in the state of acute sensitivity that the drugs induce. The drugs in question are not aphrodisiacs, and when they are taken in common by a small group the atmosphere is not in the least suggestive of a drunken brawl nor of the communal torpor of an opium den. Members of the group usually become open to each other with a high degree of friendly affection, for in the mystical phase of the experience the underlying unity or \"belongingness\" of the members can have all the clarity of a physical sensation. Indeed the social situation may become what religious bodies aim at, but all too rarely achieve, in their rites of communion---a relationship of the most vivid understanding, forgiveness, and love. Of course, this does not automatically become a permanent feeling, but neither does the sense of fellowship sometimes evoked in strictly religious gatherings. The experience corresponds almost exactly to the theological concept of a sacrament or means of grace---an unmerited gift of spiritual power whose lasting effects depend upon the use made of it in subsequent action. Catholic theology also recognizes those so-called \"extraordinary\" graces, often of mystical insight, which descend spontaneously outside the ordinary or regular means that the Church provides through the sacraments and the disciplines of prayer. It seems to me that only special pleading can maintain that the graces mediated through mushrooms, cactus plants, and scientists are artificial and spurious in contrast with those which come through religious discipline. Claims for the exclusive virtue of one's own brand is, alas, as common in organized religion as in commerce, coupled in the former instance with the puritan's sense of guilt in enjoying anything for which he has not suffered. When I wrote this book, I was well aware that LSD in particular might become a public scandal, especially in the United States where we had the precedents of Prohibition and of fantastically punitive laws against the use of marijuana---laws passed with hardly a pretense of scientific investigation of the drug, and amazingly foisted upon many other nations. That was nine years ago ( 1961 ) and since then all that I feared would happen has happened. I ask myself whether I should ever have written this book, whether I was profaning the mysteries and casting pearls before swine. I reasoned, however, that since Huxley and others had already let the secret out, it was up to me to encourage a positive, above-board, fearless, and intelligent approach to what are now known as psychedelic chemicals. But in vain. Thousands of young people, fed up with standard-brand religions which provided nothing but talk, admonition, and (usually) bad ritual, rushed immediately to LSD and other psychedelics in search of some key to genuine religious experience. As might be expected, there were accidents. A few potential psychotics were pushed over the brink, usually because they took LSD in uncontrolled circumstances, in excessive dosage, or in the arid and threatening atmosphere of hospital research run by psychiatrists who imagined that they were investigating artificially induced schizophrenia. Because most news is bad news, these accidents received full coverage in the press, to the relative exclusion of reports on the overwhelming majority of such splendid and memorable experiences as I describe further on. A divorce is news; a happy marriage isn't. There were even deliberately falsified stories in the newspapers, as that several young men taking LSD stared at the sun for so long that they became blind. Phychiatrists raised alarms about \"brain damage,\" for which no solid evidence was ever produced, and warnings were issued about its destructive effect on the genes, which was later shown to be insignificant and more or less the same as the effects of coffee and aspirin. In view of this public hysteria the Sandoz Company, which held a patent on LSD, withdrew it from the market. At the same time the United States government, having learned absolutely nothing from the disaster of Prohibition, simply banned LSD ( allowing its use only in some few research projects sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and by the Army, in its investigations of chemical warfare) and turned over its control to the police. Now a law against LSD is simply unenforceable because the substance is tasteless and colorless, because effective dosages can be confined, in vast amounts, to minute spaces, and because it can be disguised as almost anything drinkable or eatable from gin to blotting paper. Thus as soon as the reliable Sandoz material was withdrawn, amateur chemists began to produce black-market LSD in immense quantities---LSD of uncertain quality and dosage, often mixed with such other ingredients as methedrine, belladonna, and heroin. Consequently the number of psychotic episodes resulting from its use began to increase, aggravated by the fact that, in improperly controlled situations and under threat from the police, the LSD taker is an easy victim of extreme paranoia. At the same time, some of these amateurs, mainly graduate students in chemistry with a mission to \"turn people on,\" produced some tolerably good LSD. Thus there were still so many more positive experiences than negative that fascination with this alchemy continued and expanded, and though the general public associates its use with hippies and college students, it has been very widely used by mature adults ---doctors, lawyers, clergymen, artists, businessmen, professors, and levelheaded housewives. The blanket suppression of LSD and other psychedelics has been a complete disaster in that ( 1 ) it has seriously hindered proper research on these drugs; (2) it has created a profitable black market by raising the price; (3) it has embarrassed the police with an impossible assignment; (4) it has created the false fascination with fruit that is forbidden; (5) it has seriously impeded the normal work of courts of justice, and herded thousands of non-criminal types of people into already overcrowded prisons, which, as everyone knows, are schools for sodomy and for crime as a profession; ( 6 ) it has made users of psychedelics more susceptible to paranoia than ever. ** What, then, are the true dangers of real LSD? Principally that it may trigger a short- or long-term psychosis in anyone susceptible, and, despite all our techniques for psychological and neurological testing, we can never detect a potential psychotic with certainty. Anyone contemplating the use of a psychedelic chemical should weigh this risk carefully: there is a slight chance of becoming, at least temporarily, insane. The risk is probably much greater than in traveling by a commercial airline, but considerably less than in traveling by road. Every household contains things of potential danger: electricity, matches, gas, kitchen knives, carbon tetrachloride (cleaning fluid), ammonia, aerosol sprayers, alcohol, slippery bathtubs, sliding rugs, rifles, lawn mowers, axes, plate-glass doors, and swimming pools. There are no laws against the sale and possession of such things, nor is one prevented from cultivating Amanita pantherina (the most deceptive and poisonous mushroom), deadly nightshade, laburnum, morning-glory, wood rose, Scotch broom, and many other poisonous or psychedelic plants. One of the most sensible tenets of Jewish and ( at least theoretically) of Christian theology is that no substance or creature is, in itself, evil. Evil arises only in its abuse---in killing someone with a knife, committing arson with matches, or running down a pedestrian while driving alcoholized. (But note that a highly depressed, anxious, or angry driver is just as dangerous, for his attention is not on the road. ) It seems to me a sound legal principle that people should be prosecuted only for overt and clearly specifiable deeds, damaging or clearly intended to damage life, limb, and property. Laws which proscribe the mere sale, purchase, or possession of substances ( aside from machine guns and bombs ) which might be used in some harmful way invite the worst abuses of police power for political ends or for the harassment of unpopular individuals. (How easy to plant some marijuana on an unwanted competitor in business!) All such sumptuary laws (regulating private morals and creating crimes without unwilling victims ) are attempts to make personal freedom foolproof and without risk, and thus to deprive the individual of responsibility for his own life and of taking calculated risk for the achievement of political, social, athletic, scientific, or religious objectives which he feels well worth the dangers. Adventurous and creative people have always been willing, and have usually been encouraged, to take the most serious risks in the exploration of the outer world and in the development of scientific and technological skill. Many young people now feel that the time has come to explore the inner world, and are willing to take the unfamiliar risks which it involves. They, too, should be encouraged and also assisted with all the care and wisdom at our disposal. Why permit the purely athletic tour de force of climbing Everest (using oxygen) and forbid the spiritual adventure of ascending Mount Sumeru, Mount Zion, or Mount Analogue (using psychedelics)? Superficially, the public and official fear of psychedelic drugs is based on uninformed association with such addictive poisons as heroin, amphetamines, and barbiturates. But drinking coffee or whisky is also \"using drugs,\" and this is allowed even though the effects may be harmful and the creative results negligible. Psychedelic drugs are feared, basically, for the same reason that mystical experience has been feared, discouraged, and even condemned in the Catholic, Protestant, and Islamic orthodoxies. It leads to disenchantment and apathy toward the approved social rewards of status and success, to chuckles at pretentiousness and pomposity, and, worse, to disbelief in the Church-and-State dogma that we are all God's adopted orphans or fluky little germs in a mechanical and mindless universe. No authoritarian government, whether ecclesiastical or secular, can tolerate the apprehension that each one of us is God in disguise, and that our real inmost, outmost, and utmost Self cannot be killed. That's why they had to do away with Jesus. Thus the possibility that even a preliminary glimpse of this apprehension is available through taking a pill or chewing a plant threatens mystical experience for the millions---that is, masses of people who will be difficult to rule by force of \"authority.\" It is even now being recognized in the United States that the real danger of psychedelics is not so much neurological as political---that \"turned-on\" people are not interested in serving the power games of the present rulers. Looking at the successful men, they see completely boring lives. In the Epilogue I shall make it clear that psychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. When you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope; he goes away and works on what he has seen. Furthermore, speaking quite strictly, mystical insight is no more in the chemical itself than biological knowledge is in the microscope. There is no difference in principle between sharpening perception with an external instrument, such as a microscope, and sharpening it with an internal instrument, such as one of these three drugs. If they are an affront to the dignity of the mind, the microscope is an affront to the dignity of the eye and the telephone to the dignity of the ear. Strictly speaking, these drugs do not impart wisdom at all, any more than the microscope alone gives knowledge. They provide the raw materials of wisdom, and are useful to the extent that the individual can integrate what they reveal into the whole pattern of his behavior and the whole system of his knowledge. As an escape, an isolated and dissociated ecstasy, they may have the same sort of value as a rest cure or a good entertainment. But this is like using a giant computer to play tick-tack-toe, and the hours of heightened perception are wasted unless occupied with sustained reflection or meditation upon whatever themes may be suggested. The nearest thing I know in literature to the reflective use of one of these drugs is the so-called Bead Game in Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi (Das Glasperlenspiel). Hesse writes of a distant future in which an order of scholar-mystics have discovered an ideographic language which can relate all the branches of science and art, philosophy and religion. The game consists in playing with the relationships between configurations in these various fields in the same way that the musician plays with harmonic and contrapuntal relationships. From such elements as the design of a Chinese house, a Scarlatti sonata, a topological formula, and a verse from the Upanishads, the players will elucidate a common theme and develop its application in numerous directions. No two games are the same, for not only do the elements differ, but also there is no thought of attempting to force a static and uniform order upon the world. The universal language facilitates the perception of relationships but does not fix them, and is founded upon a \"musical\" conception of the world in which order is as dynamic and changing as the patterns of sound in a fugue. Similarly, in my investigations of LSD or psilocybin, I usually started with some such theme as polarity, transformation (as of food into organism), competition for survival, the relation of the abstract to the concrete, or of Logos to Eros, and then allowed my heightened perception to elucidate the theme in terms of certain works of art or music, of some natural object as a fern, a flower, or a sea shell, of a religious or mythological archetype (it might be the Mass), and even of personal relationships with those who happened to be with me at the time. Or I would concentrate upon one of the senses and try, as it were, to turn it back upon itself so as to see the process of seeing, and from this move on to trying to know knowing, so approaching the problem of my own identity. From these reflections there arise intuitive insights of astonishing clarity, and because there is little difficulty in remembering them after the effects of the drug have ceased (especially if they are recorded or written down at the time), the days or weeks following may be used for testing them by the normal standards of logical, aesthetic, philosophical, or scientific criticism. As might be expected, some prove to be valid and others not. It is the same with the sudden hunches that come to the artist or inventor in the ordinary way; they are not always as true or as applicable as they seem to be in the movement of illumination. The drugs appear to give an enormous impetus to the creative intuition, and thus to be of more value for constructive invention and research than for psychotherapy in the ordinary sense of \"adjusting\" the disturbed personality. Their best sphere of use is not the mental hospital but the studio and the laboratory, or the institute of advanced studies. The following pages make no attempt to be a scientific report on the effects of these chemicals, with the usual details of dosage, time and place, physical symptoms, and the like. Such documents exist by the thousand, and, in view of our very rudimentary knowledge of the brain, seem to me to have a rather limited value. As well try to understand a book by dissolving it in solution and popping it into a centrifuge. My object is rather to give some impression of the new world of consciousness which these substances reveal. I do not believe that this world is either a hallucination or an unimpeachable revelation of truth. It is probably the way things appear when certain inhibitory processes of the brain and senses are suspended, but this is a world in some ways so unfamiliar that it is liable to misinterpretation. Our first impressions may be as wide of the mark as those of the traveler in an unfamiliar country or of astronomers taking their first look at the galaxies beyond our own. I have written this account as if the whole experience had happened on one day in a single place, but it is in fact a composite of several occasions. Except where I am describing visions before closed eyes, and this is always specified, none of these experiences are hallucinations. They are simply changed ways of seeing, interpreting, and reacting to actual persons and events in the world of \"public reality,\" which, for purposes of this description, is a country estate on the West Coast of America with garden. orchard, barns, and surrounding mountains---all just as described, including the rattletrap car loaded with junk. Consciousness-changing drugs are popularly associated with the evocation of bizarre and fantastic images, but in my own experience this happens only with closed eyes. Otherwise, it is simply that the natural world is endowed with a richness of grace, color, significance, and, sometimes, humor, for which our normal adjectives are insufficient. The speed of thought and association is increased so astonishingly that it is hard for words to keep pace with the flood of ideas that come to mind. Passages that may strike the reader as ordinary philosophical reflection are reports of what, at the time, appear to be the most tangible certainties. So, too, images that appear before closed eyes are not just figments of imagination, but patterns and scenes so intense and autonomous that they seem to be physically present. The latter have, however, proved of less interest to me than one's transformed impression of the natural world and the heightened speed of associative thought, and it is thus with these that the following account is chiefly concerned. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- *Normal dosage for mescaline is 300 milligrams, for LSD-25 100 micrograms, and for psilocybin 20 milligrams. The general reader interested in a more detailed account of consciousness-changing drugs and the present state of research concerning them should consult Robert S. de Ropp's Drugs and the Mind (Grove Press, New York, 1960). (back) **For purposes of this summary I am including marijuana and hashish as psychedelics, though they do not have the potency of LSD. (back) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- The Joyous Cosmology ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- T0 BEGIN WITH, this world has a different kind of time. It is the time of biological rhythm, not of the clock and all that goes with the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time is notoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our attention, whether of interest or boredom, and upon the alignment of our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Here the present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present. It is a dancing present---the unfolding of a pattern which has no specific destination in the future but is simply its own point. It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as much the goal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive every detail of the movement with infinitely greater richness of articulation. Normally we do not so much look at things as overlook them. The eye sees types and classes---flower, leaf, rock, bird, fire---mental pictures of things rather than things, rough outlines filled with flat color, always a little dusty and dim. But here the depth of light and structure in a bursting bud go on forever. There is time to see them, time for the whole intricacy of veins and capillaries to develop in consciousness, time to see down and down into the shape of greenness, which is not green at all, but a whole spectrum generalizing itself as green---purple, gold, the sunlit turquoise of the ocean, the intense luminescence of the emerald. I cannot decide where shape ends and color begins. The bud has opened and the fresh leaves fan out and curve back with a gesture which is unmistakably communicative but does not say anything except, \"Thus!\" And somehow that is quite satisfactory, even startlingly clear. The meaning is transparent in the same way that the color and the texture are transparent, with light which does not seem to fall upon surfaces from above but to be right inside the structure and color. Which is of course where it is, for light is an inseparable trinity of sun, object, and eye, and the chemistry of the leaf is its color, its light. But at the same time color and light are the gift of the eye to the leaf and the sun. Transparency is the property of the eyeball, projected outward as luminous space, interpreting quanta of energy in terms of the gelatinous fibers in the head. I begin to feel that the world is at once inside my head and outside it, and the two, inside and outside, begin to include or \"cap\" one another like an infinite series of concentric spheres. I am unusually aware that everything I am sensing is also my body---that light, color, shape, sound, and texture are terms and properties of the brain conferred upon the outside world. I am not looking at the world, not confronting it; I am knowing it by a continuous process of transforming it into myself, so that everything around me, the whole globe of space, no longer feels away from me but in the middle. This is at first confusing. I am not quite sure of the direction from which sounds come. The visual space seems to reverberate with them as if it were a drum. The surrounding hills rumble with the sound of a truck, and the rumble and the color-shape of the hills become one and the same gesture. I use that word deliberately and shall use it again. The hills are moving into their stillness. They mean something because they are being transformed into my brain, and my brain is an organ of meaning. The forests of redwood trees upon them look like green fire, and the copper gold of the sun-dried grass heaves immensely into the sky. Time is so slow as to be a kind of eternity, and the flavor of eternity transfers itself to the hills---burnished mountains which I seem to remember from an immeasurably distant past, at once so unfamiliar as to be exotic and yet as familiar as my own hand. Thus transformed into consciousness, into the electric, interior luminosity of the nerves, the world seems vaguely insubstantial--- developed upon a color film, resounding upon the skin of a drum, pressing, not with weight, but with vibrations interpreted as weight. Solidity is a neurological invention, and, I wonder, can the nerves be solid to themselves? Where do we begin? Does the order of the brain create the order of the world, or the order of the world the brain? The two seem like egg and hen, or like back and front. The physical world is vibration, quanta, but vibrations of what? To the eye, form and color; to the ear, sound; to the nose, scent; to the fingers, touch. But these are all different languages for the same thing, different qualities of sensitivity, different dimensions of consciousness. The question, \"Of what are they differing forms?\" seems to have no meaning. What is light to the eye is sound to the ear. I have the image of the senses being terms, forms, or dimensions not of one thing common to all, but of each other, locked in a circle of mutuality. Closely examined, shape becomes color, which becomes vibration, which becomes sound, which becomes smell, which becomes taste, and then touch, and then again shape. (One can see, for example, that the shape of a leaf is its color. There is no outline around the leaf; the outline is the limit where one colored surface becomes another.) I see all these sensory dimensions as a round dance, gesticulations of one pattern being transformed into gesticulations of another. And these gesticulations are flowing through a space that has still other dimensions, which I want to describe as tones of emotional color, of light or sound being joyous or fearful, gold elated or lead depressed. These, too, form a circle of reciprocity, a round spectrum so polarized that we can only describe each in terms of the others. Sometimes the image of the physical world is not so much a dance of gestures as a woven texture. Light, sound, touch, taste, and smell become a continuous warp, with the feeling that the whole dimension of sensation is a single continuum or field. Crossing the warp is a woof representing the dimension of meaning---moral and aesthetic values, personal or individual uniqueness, logical significance, and expressive form---and the two dimensions interpenetrate so as to make distinguishable shapes seem like ripples in the water of sensation. The warp and the woof stream together, for the weaving is neither flat nor static but a many-directioned cross-flow of impulses filling the whole volume of space. I feel that the world is on something in somewhat the same way that a color photograph is on a film, underlying and connecting the patches of color, though the film here is a dense rain of energy. I see that what it is on is my brain---\"that enchanted loom,\" as Sherrington called it. Brain and world, warp of sense and woof of meaning, seem to interpenetrate inseparably. They hold their boundaries or limits in common in such a way as to define one another and to be impossible without each other. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- I am listening to the music of an organ. As leaves seemed to gesture, the organ seems quite literally to speak. There is no use of the vox humana stop, but every sound seems to issue from a vast human throat, moist with saliva. As, with the base pedals, the player moves slowly down the scale, the sounds seem to blow forth in immense, gooey spludges. As I listen more carefully, the spludges acquire texture---expanding circles of vibration finely and evenly toothed like combs, no longer moist and liquidinous like the living throat, but mechanically discontinuous. The sound disintegrates into the innumerable individual drrrits of vibration. Listening on, the gaps close, or perhaps each individual drrrit becomes in its turn a spludge. The liquid and the hard, the continuous and the discontinuous, the gooey and the prickly, seem to be transformations of each other, or to be different levels of magnification upon the same thing. This theme recurs in a hundred different ways---the inseparable polarity of opposites, or the mutuality and reciprocity of all the possible contents of consciousness. It is easy to see theoretically that all perception is of contrasts---figure and ground, light and shadow, clear and vague, firm and weak. But normal attention seems to have difficulty in taking in both at once. Both sensuously and conceptually we seem to move serially from one to the other; we do not seem to be able to attend to the figure without relative unconsciousness of the ground. But in this new world the mutuality of things is quite clear at every level. The human face, for example, becomes clear in all its aspects---the total form together with each single hair and wrinkle. Faces become all ages at once, for characteristics that suggest age also suggest youth by implication; the bony structure suggesting the skull evokes instantly the newborn infant. The associative couplings of the brain seem to fire simultaneously instead of one at a time, projecting a view of life which may be terrifying in its ambiguity or joyous in its integrity. Decision can be completely paralyzed by the sudden realization that there is no way of having good without evil, or that it is impossible to act upon reliable authority without choosing, from your own inexperience, to do so. If sanity implies madness and faith doubt, am I basically a psychotic pretending to be sane, a blithering terrified idiot who manages, temporarily, to put on an act of being self-possessed? I begin to see my whole life as a masterpiece of duplicity---the confused, helpless, hungry, and hideously sensitive little embryo at the root of me having learned, step by step, to comply, placate, bully, wheedle, flatter, bluff, and cheat my way into being taken for a person of competence and reliability. For when it really comes down to it, what do any of us know? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass and a choir of nuns responding. His mature, cultivated voice rings with the serene authority of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, of the Faith once and for all delivered to the saints, and the nuns respond, naively it seems, with childlike, utterly innocent devotion. But, listening again, I can hear the priest \"putting on\" his voice, hear the inflated, pompous balloon, the studiedly unctuous tones of a master deceptionist who has the poor little nuns, kneeling in their stalls, completely cowed. Listen deeper. The nuns are not cowed at all. They are playing possum. With just a little stiffening, the limp gesture of bowing turns into the gesture of the closing claw. With too few men to go around, the nuns know what is good for them: how to bend and survive. But this profoundly cynical view of things is only an intermediate stage. I begin to congratulate the priest on his gamesmanship, on the sheer courage of being able to put up such a performance of authority when he knows precisely nothing. Perhaps there is no other knowing than the mere competence of the act. If, at the heart of one's being, there is no real self to which one ought to be true, sincerity is simply nerve; it lies in the unabashed vigor of the pretense. But pretense is only pretense when it is assumed that the act is not true to the agent. Find the agent. In the priest's voice I hear down at the root the primordial howl of the beast in the jungle, but it has been inflected, complicated, refined, and textured with centuries of culture. Every new twist, every additional subtlety, was a fresh gambit in the game of making the original howl more effective. At first, crude and unconcealed, the cry for food or mate, or just noise for the fun of it, making the rocks echo. Then rhythm to enchant. then changes of tone to plead or threaten. Then words to specify the need, to promise and bargain. And then, much later, the gambits of indirection. The feminine stratagem of stooping to conquer, the claim to superior worth in renouncing the world for the spirit, the cunning of weakness proving stronger than the might of muscle---and the meek inheriting the earth. As I listen, then, I can hear in that one voice the simultaneous presence of all the levels of man's history, as of all the stages of life before man. Every step in the game becomes as clear as the rings in a severed tree. But this is an ascending hierarchy of maneuvers, of stratagems capping stratagems, all symbolized in the overlays of refinement beneath which the original howl is still sounding. Sometimes the howl shifts from the mating call of the adult animal to the helpless crying of the baby, and I feel all man's music---its pomp and circumstance, its gaiety, its awe, its confident solemnity---as just so much complication and concealment of baby wailing for mother. And as I want to cry with pity, I know I am sorry for myself. I, as an adult, am also back there alone in the dark, just as the primordial howl is still present beneath the sublime modulations of the chant. You poor baby! And yet---you selfish little bastard! As I try to find the agent behind the act, the motivating force at the bottom of the whole thing, I seem to see only an endless ambivalence. Behind the mask of love I find my innate selfishness. What a predicament I am in if someone asks, \"Do you really love me?\" I can't say yes without saying no, for the only answer that will really satisfy is, \"Yes, I love you so much I could eat you! My love for you is identical with my love for myself. I love you with the purest selfishness.\" No one wants to be loved out of a sense of duty. So I will be very frank. \"Yes, I am pure, selfish desire and I love you because you make me feel wonderful---at any rate for the time being.\" But then I begin to wonder whether there isn't something a bit cunning in this frankness. It is big of me to be so sincere, to make a play for her by not pretending to be more than I am---unlike the other guys who say they love her for herself. I see that there is always something insincere about trying to be sincere, as if I were to say openly, \"The statement that I am now making is a lie.\" There seems to be something phony about every attempt to define myself, to be totally honest. The trouble is that I can't see the back, much less the inside, of my head. I can't be honest because I don't fully know what I am. Consciousness peers out from a center which it cannot see---and that is the root of the matter. Life seems to resolve itself down to a tiny germ or nipple of sensitivity. I call it the Eenie-Weenie---a squiggling little nucleus that is trying to make love to itself and can never quite get there. The whole fabulous complexity of vegetable and animal life, as of human civilization, is just a colossal elaboration of the Eenie-Weenie trying to make the Eenie-Weenie. I am in love with myself, but cannot seek myself without hiding myself. As I pursue my own tail, it runs away from me. Does the amoeba split itself in two in an attempt to solve this problem? I try to go deeper, sinking thought and feeling down and down to their ultimate beginnings. What do I mean by loving myself? In what form do I know myself? Always, it seems, in the form of something other, something strange. The landscape I am watching is also a state of myself, of the neurons in my head. I feel the rock in my hand in terms of my own fingers. And nothing is stranger than my own body---the sensation of the pulse, the eye seen through a magnifying glass in the mirror, the shock of realizing that oneself is something in the external world. At root, there is simply no way of separating self from other, self-love from other-love. All knowledge of self is knowledge of other, and all knowledge of other knowledge of self. I begin to see that self and other, the familiar and the strange, the internal and the external, the predictable and the unpredictable imply each other. One is seek and the other is hide, and the more I become aware of their implying each other, the more I feel them to be one with each other. I become curiously affectionate and intimate with all that seemed alien. In the features of everything foreign, threatening, terrifying, incomprehensible, and remote I begin to recognize myself. Yet this is a \"myself\" which I seem to be remembering from long, long ago---not at all my empirical ego of yesterday, not my specious personality. The \"myself\" which I am beginning to recognize, which I had forgotten but actually know better than anything else, goes far back beyond my childhood, beyond the time when adults confused me and tried to tell me that I was someone else; when, because they were bigger and stronger, they could terrify me with their imaginary fears and bewilder and outface me in the complicated game that I had not yet learned. (The sadism of the teacher explaining the game and yet having to prove his superiority in it.) Long before all that, long before I was an embryo in my mother's womb, there looms the ever-so-familiar stranger, the everything not me, which I recognize, with a joy immeasurably more intense than a meeting of lovers separated by centuries, to be my original self. The good old sonofabitch who got me involved in this whole game. At the same time everyone and everything around me takes on the feeling of having been there always, and then forgotten, and then remembered again. We are sitting in a garden surrounded in every direction by uncultivated hills, a garden of fuchsias and hummingbirds in a valley that leads down to the westernmost ocean, and where the gulls take refuge in storms. At some time in the middle of the twentieth century, upon an afternoon in the summer, we are sitting around a table on the terrace, eating dark homemade bread and drinking white wine. And yet we seem to have been there forever, for the people with me are no longer the humdrum and harassed little personalities with names, addresses, and social security numbers, the specifically dated mortals we are all pretending to be. They appear rather as immortal archetypes of themselves without, however, losing their humanity. It is just that their differing characters seem, like the priest's voice, to contain all history; they are at once unique and eternal, men and women but also gods and goddesses. For now that we have time to look at each other we become timeless. The human form becomes immeasurably precious and, as if to symbolize this, the eyes become intelligent jewels, the hair spun gold, and the flesh translucent ivory. Between those who enter this world together there is also a love which is distinctly eucharistic, an acceptance of each other's natures from the heights to the depths. Ella, who planted the garden, is a beneficent Circe---sorceress, daughter of the moon, familiar of cats and snakes, herbalist and healer---with the youngest old face one has ever seen, exquisitely wrinkled, silver-black hair rippled like flames. Robert is a manifestation of Pan, but a Pan of bulls instead of the Pan of goats, with frizzled short hair tufted into blunt horns ---a man all sweating muscle and body, incarnation of exuberant glee. Beryl, his wife, is a nymph who has stepped out of the forest, a mermaid of the land with swinging hair and a dancing body that seems to be naked even when clothed. It is her bread that we are eating, and it tastes like the Original Bread of which mother's own bread was a bungled imitation. And then there is Mary, beloved in the usual, dusty world, but in this world an embodiment of light and gold, daughter of the sun, with eyes formed from the evening sky---a creature of all ages, baby, moppet, maid, matron, crone, and corpse, evoking love of all ages. I try to find words that will suggest the numinous, mythological quality of these people. Yet at the same time they are as familiar as if I had known them for centuries, or rather, as if I were recognizing them again as lost friends whom I knew at the beginning of time, from a country begotten before all worlds. This is of course bound up with the recognition of my own most ancient identity, older by far than the blind squiggling of the Eenie-Weenie, as if the highest form that consciousness could take had somehow been present at the very beginning of things. All of us look at each other knowingly, for the feeling that we knew each other in that most distant past conceals something else---tacit, awesome, almost unmentionable ---the realization that at the deep center of a time perpendicular to ordinary time we are, and always have been, one. We acknowledge the marvelously hidden plot, the master illusion, whereby we appear to be different. The shock of recognition. In the form of everything most other, alien, and remote---the ever-receding galaxies, the mystery of death, the terrors of disease and madness, the foreign- feeling, gooseflesh world of sea monsters and spiders, the queasy labyrinth of my own insides---in all these forms I have crept up on myself and yelled \"Boo!\" I scare myself out of my wits, and, while out of my wits, cannot remember just how it happened. Ordinarily I am lost in a maze. I don't know how I got here, for I have lost the thread and forgotten the intricately convoluted system of passages through which the game of hide-and-seek was pursued. (Was it the path I followed in growing the circuits of my brain?) But now the principle of the maze is clear. It is the device of something turning back upon itself so as to seem to be other, and the turns have been so many and so dizzyingly complex that I am quite bewildered. The principle is that all dualities and opposites are not disjoined but polar; they do not encounter and confront one another from afar; they exfoliate from a common center. Ordinary thinking conceals polarity and relativity because it employs terms, the terminals or ends, the poles, neglecting what lies between them. The difference of front and back, to be and not to be, hides their unity and mutuality. Now consciousness, sense perception, is always a sensation of contrasts. It is a specialization in differences, in noticing, and nothing is definable, classifiable, or noticeable except by contrast with something else. But man does not live by consciousness alone, for the linear, step-by-step, contrast-by-contrast procedure of attention is quite inadequate for organizing anything so complex as a living body. The body itself has an \"omniscience\" which is unconscious, or superconscious, just because it deals with relation instead of contrast, with harmonies rather than discords. It \"thinks\" or organizes as a plant grows, not as a botanist describes its growth. This is why Shiva has ten arms, for he represents the dance of life, the omnipotence of being able to do innumerably many things at once. In the type of experience I am describing, it seems that the superconscious method of thinking becomes conscious. We see the world as the whole body sees it, and for this very reason there is the greatest difficulty in attempting to translate this mode of vision into a form of language that is based on contrast and classification. To the extent, then, that man has become a being centered in consciousness, he has become centered in clash, conflict, and discord. He ignores, as beneath notice, the astounding perfection of his organism as a whole, and this is why, in most people, there is such a deplorable disparity between the intelligent and marvelous order of their bodies and the trivial preoccupations of their consciousness. But in this other world the situation is reversed. Ordinary people look like gods because the values of the organism are uppermost, and the concerns of consciousness fall back into the subordinate position which they should properly hold. Love, unity, harmony, and relationship therefore take precedence over war and division. For what consciousness overlooks is the fact that all boundaries and divisions are held in common by their opposite sides and areas, so that when a boundary changes its shape both sides move together. It is like the yang-yin symbol of the Chinese---the black and white fishes divided by an S-curve inscribed within a circle. The bulging head of one is the narrowing tail of the other. But how much more difficult it is to see that my skin and its movements belong both to me and to the external world, or that the spheres of influence of different human beings have common walls like so many rooms in a house, so that the movement of my wall is also the movement of yours. You can do what you like in your room just so long as I can do what I like in mine. But each man's room is himself in his fullest extension, so that my expansion is your contraction and vice versa. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- I am looking at what I would ordinarily call a confusion of bushes---a tangle of plants and weeds with branches and leaves going every which way. But now that the organizing, relational mind is uppermost I see that what is confusing is not the bushes but my clumsy method of thinking. Every twig is in its proper place, and the tangle has become an arabesque more delicately ordered than the fabulous doodles in the margins of Celtic manuscripts. In this same state of consciousness I have seen a woodland at fall, with the whole multitude of almost bare branches and twigs in silhouette against the sky, not as a confusion, but as the lacework or tracery of an enchanted jeweler. A rotten log bearing rows of fungus and patches of moss became as precious as any work of Cellini---an inwardly luminous construct of jet, amber, jade, and ivory, all the porous and spongy disintegrations of the wood seeming to have been carved out with infinite patience and skill. I do not know whether this mode of vision organizes the world in the same way that it organizes the body, or whether it is just that the natural world is organized in that way. A journey into this new mode of consciousness gives one a marvelously enhanced appreciation of patterning in nature, a fascination deeper than ever with the structure of ferns, the formation of crystals, the markings upon sea shells, the incredible jewelry of such unicellular creatures of the ocean as the radiolaria, the fairy architecture of seeds and pods, the engineering of bones and skeletons, the aerodynamics of feathers, and the astonishing profusion of eye-forms upon the wings of butterflies and birds. All this involved delicacy of organization may, from one point of view, be strictly functional for the purposes of reproduction and survival. But when you come down to it, the survival of these creatures is the same as their very existence---and what is that for? More and more it seems that the ordering of nature is an art akin to music---fugues in shell and cartilage, counterpoint in fibers and capillaries, throbbing rhythm in waves of sound, light, and nerve. And oneself is connected with it quite inextricably---a node, a ganglion, an electronic interweaving of paths, circuits, and impulses that stretch and hum through the whole of time and space. The entire pattern swirls in its complexity like smoke in sunbeams or the rippling networks of sunlight in shallow water. Transforming itself endlessly into itself, the pattern alone remains. The crosspoints, nodes, nets, and curlicues vanish perpetually into each other. \"The baseless fabric of this vision.\" It is its own base. When the ground dissolves beneath me I float. Closed-eye fantasies in this world seem sometimes to be revelations of the secret workings of the brain, of the associative and patterning processes, the ordering systems which carry out all our sensing and thinking. Unlike the one I have just described, they are for the most part ever more complex variations upon a theme---ferns sprouting ferns sprouting ferns in multidimensional spaces, vast kaleidoscopic domes of stained glass or mosaic, or patterns like the models of highly intricate molecules---systems of colored balls, each one of which turns out to be a multitude of smaller balls, forever and ever. Is this, perhaps, an inner view of the organizing process which, when the eyes are open, makes sense of the world even at points where it appears to be supremely messy? Later that same afternoon, Robert takes us over to his barn from which he has been cleaning out junk and piling it into a big and battered Buick convertible, with all the stuffing coming out of the upholstery. The sight of trash poses two of the great questions of human life, \"Where are we going to put it?\" and \"Who's going to clean up?\" From one point of view living creatures are simply tubes, putting things in at one end and pushing them out at the other---until the tube wears out. The problem is always where to put what is pushed out at the other end, especially when it begins to pile so high that the tubes are in danger of being crowded off the earth by their own refuse. And the questions have metaphysical overtones. \"Where are we going to put it?\" asks for the foundation upon which things ultimately rest ---the First Cause, the Divine Ground, the bases of morality, the origin of action. \"Who's going to clean up?\" is asking where responsibility ultimately lies, or how to solve our ever-multiplying problems other than by passing the buck to the next generation. I contemplate the mystery of trash in its immediate manifestation: Robert's car piled high, with only the driver's seat left unoccupied by broken door-frames, rusty stoves, tangles of chicken-wire, squashed cans, insides of ancient harmoniums, nameless enormities of cracked plastic, headless dolls, bicycles without wheels, torn cushions vomiting kapok, non-returnable bottles, busted dressmakers' dummies, rhomboid picture-frames, shattered bird-cages, and inconceivable messes of string, electric wiring, orange peels, eggshells, potato skins, and light bulbs---all garnished with some ghastly-white chemical powder that we call \"angel shit.\" Tomorrow we shall escort this in a joyous convoy to the local dump. And then what? Can any melting and burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin---especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away? The only answer seems to be that of the present group. The sight of Robert's car has everyone helpless with hysterics. The Divine Comedy. All things dissolve in laughter. And for Robert this huge heap of marvelously incongruous uselessness is a veritable creation, a masterpiece of nonsense. He slams it together and ropes it securely to the bulbous, low-slung wreck of the supposedly chic convertible, and then stands back to admire it as if it were a float for a carnival. Theme: the American way of life. But our laughter is without malice, for in this state of consciousness everything is the doing of gods. The culmination of civilization in monumental heaps of junk is seen, not as thoughtless ugliness, but as self-caricature---as the creation of phenomenally absurd collages and abstract sculptures in deliberate but kindly mockery of our own pretensions. For in this world nothing is wrong, nothing is even stupid. The sense of wrong is simply failure to see where something fits into a pattern, to be confused as to the hierarchical level upon which an event belongs---a play which seems quite improper at level 28 may be exactly right at level 96. I am speaking of levels or stages in the labyrinth of twists and turns, gambits and counter-gambits, in which life is involving and evolving itself ---the cosmological one-upmanship which the yang and the yin, the light and the dark principles, are forever playing, the game which at some early level in its development seems to be the serious battle between good and evil. If the square may be defined as one who takes the game seriously, one must admire him for the very depth of his involvement, for the courage to be so far-out that he doesn't know where he started. The more prosaic, the more dreadfully ordinary anyone or anything seems to be, the more I am moved to marvel at the ingenuity with which divinity hides in order to seek itself, at the lengths to which this cosmic joie de vivre will go in elaborating its dance. I think of a corner gas station on a hot afternoon. Dust and exhaust fumes, the regular Standard guy all baseball and sports cars, the billboards halfheartedly gaudy, the flatness so reassuring---nothing around here but just us folks! I can see people just pretending not to see that they are avatars of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, that the cells of their bodies aren't millions of gods, that the dust isn't a haze of jewels. How solemnly they would go through the act of not understanding me if I were to step up and say, \"Well, who do you think you're kidding? Come off it, Shiva, you old rascal! It's a great act, but it doesn't fool me.\" But the conscious ego doesn't know that it is something which that divine organ, the body, is only pretending to be.* When people go to a guru, a master of wisdom, seeking a way out of darkness, all he really does is to humor them in their pretense until they are outfaced into dropping it. He tells nothing, but the twinkle in his eye speaks to the unconscious---\"You know....You know!\" In the contrast world of ordinary consciousness man feels himself, as will, to be something in nature but not of it. He likes it or dislikes it. He accepts it or resists it. He moves it or it moves him. But in the basic superconsciousness of the whole organism this division does not exist. The organism and its surrounding world are a single, integrated pattern of action in which there is neither subject nor object, doer nor done to. At this level there is not one thing called pain and another thing called myself, which dislikes pain. Pain and the \"response\" to pain are the same thing. When this becomes conscious it feels as if everything that happens is my own will. But this is a preliminary and clumsy way of feeling that what happens outside the body is one process with what happens inside it. This is that \"original identity\" which ordinary language and our conventional definitions of man so completely conceal. The active and the passive are two phases of the same act. A seed, floating in its white sunburst of down, drifts across the sky, sighing with the sound of a jet plane invisible above. I catch it by one hair between thumb and index finger, and am astonished to watch this little creature actually wiggling and pulling as if it were struggling to get away. Common sense tells me that this tugging is the action of the wind, not of the thistledown. But then I recognize that it is the \"intelligence\" of the seed to have just such delicate antennae of silk that, in an environment of wind, it can move. Having such extensions, it moves itself with the wind. When it comes to it, is there any basic difference between putting up a sail and pulling an oar? If anything, the former is a more intelligent use of effort than the latter. True, the seed does not intend to move itself with the wind, but neither did I intend to have arms and legs. It is this vivid realization of the reciprocity of will and world, active and passive, inside and outside, self and not-self, which evokes the aspect of these experiences that is most puzzling from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness: the strange and seemingly unholy conviction that \"I\" am God. In Western culture this sensation is seen as the very signature of insanity But in India it is simply a matter of course that the deepest center of man, atman, is the deepest center of the universe, Brahman. Why not? Surely a continuous view of the world is more whole, more holy, more healthy, than one in which there is a yawning emptiness between the Cause and its effects. Obviously, the \"I\" which is God is not the ego, the consciousness of self which is simultaneously an unconsciousness of the fact that its outer limits are held in common with the inner limits of the rest of the world. But in this wider, less ignore-ant consciousness I am forced to see that everything I claim to will and intend has a common boundary with all I pretend to disown. The limits of what I will, the form and shape of all those actions which I claim as mine, are identical and coterminous with the limits of all those events which I have been taught to define as alien and external. The feeling of self is no longer confined to the inside of the skin. Instead, my individual being seems to grow out from the rest of the universe like a hair from a head or a limb from a body, so that my center is also the center of the whole. I find that in ordinary consciousness I am habitually trying to ring myself off from this totality, that I am perpetually on the defensive. But what am I trying to protect? Only very occasionally are my defensive attitudes directly concerned with warding off physical damage or deprivation. For the most part I am defending my defenses: rings around rings around rings around nothing. Guards inside a fortress inside entrenchments inside a radar curtain. The military war is the outward parody of the war of ego versus world: only the guards are safe. In the next war only the air force will outlive the women and children. I trace myself back through the labyrinth of my brain, through the innumerable turns by which I have ringed myself off and, by perpetual circling, obliterated the original trail whereby I entered this forest. Back through the tunnels---through the devious status-and-survival strategy of adult life, through the interminable passages which we remember in dreams ---all the streets we have ever traveled, the corridors of schools, the winding pathways between the legs of tables and chairs where one crawled as a child, the tight and bloody exit from the womb, the fountainous surge through the channel of the penis, the timeless wanderings through ducts and spongy caverns. Down and back through ever-narrowing tubes to the point where the passage itself is the traveler---a thin string of molecules going through the trial and error of getting itself into the right order to be a unit of organic life. Relentlessly back and back through endless and whirling dances in the astronomically proportioned spaces which surround the original nuclei of the world, the centers of centers, as remotely distant on the inside as the nebulae beyond our galaxy on the outside. Down and at last out---out of the cosmic maze to recognize in and as myself, the bewildered traveler, the forgotten yet familiar sensation of the original impulse of all things, supreme identity, inmost light, ultimate center, self more me than myself. Standing in the midst of Ella's garden I feel, with a peace so deep that it sings to be shared with all the world, that at last I belong, that I have returned to the home behind home, that I have come into the inheritance unknowingly bequeathed from all my ancestors since the beginning. Plucked like the strings of a harp, the warp and woof of the world reverberate with memories of triumphant hymns. The sure foundation upon which I had sought to stand has turned out to be the center from which I seek. The elusive substance beneath all the forms of the universe is discovered as the immediate gesture of my hand. But how did I ever get lost? And why have I traveled so far through these intertwined tunnels that I seem to be the quaking vortex of defended defensiveness which is my conventional self? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Going indoors I find that all the household furniture is alive. Everything gestures. Tables are tabling, pots are potting, walls are walling, fixtures are fixturing---a world of events instead of things. Robert turns on the phonograph, without telling me what is being played. Looking intently at the pictures picturing, I only gradually become conscious of the music, and at first cannot decide whether I am hearing an instrument or a human voice simply falling. A single stream of sound, curving, rippling, and jiggling with a soft snarl that at last reveals it to be a reed instrument---some sort of oboe. Later, human voices join it. But they are not singing words, nothing but a kind of \"buoh---buah---bueeh\" which seems to be exploring all the liquidinous inflections of which the voice is capable. What has Robert got here? I imagine it must be some of his far-out friends in a great session of nonsense-chanting. The singing intensifies into the most refined, exuberant, and delightful warbling, burbling. honking. hooting. and howling---which quite obviously means nothing whatsoever. and is being done out of pure glee. There is a pause. A voice says. \"Dit!\" Another seems to reply, \"Da!\" Then, \"Dit-da! Di-dittty-da!\" And getting gradually faster. \"Da-di-ditty-di-ditty-da! Di-da-di-ditty-ditty-da-di-da-di-ditty-da-da!\" And so on, until the players are quite out of their minds. The record cover which Robert now shows me, says \"Classical Music of India,\" and informs me that this is a series edited by Alain Danielou, who happens to be the most serious, esoteric, and learned scholar of Hindu music, and an exponent. in the line of Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy, of the most formal, traditional, and difficult interpretation of Yoga and Vedanta. Somehow I cannot quite reconcile Danielou, the pandit of pandits, with this delirious outpouring of human bird-song. I feel my leg is being pulled. Or perhaps Danielou's leg. But then, maybe not. Oh, indeed not ! For quite suddenly I feel my understanding dawning into a colossal clarity, as if everything were opening up down to the roots of my being and of time and space themselves. The sense of the world becomes totally obvious. I am struck with amazement that I or anyone could have thought life a problem or being a mystery. I call to everyone to gather round. \"Listen, there's something I must tell. I've never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn't matter a bit if you don't understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as you are, even if you don't know it. Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play---exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone! There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.\" Of course, to say that life is just a gesture, an action without agent, recipient, or purpose, sounds much more empty and futile than joyous. But to me it seems that an ego, a substantial entity to which experience happens, is more of a minus than a plus. It is an estrangement from experience, a lack of participation. And in this moment I feel absolutely with the world, free of that chronic resistance to experience which blocks the free flowing of life and makes us move like muscle-bound dancers. But I don't have to overcome resistance. I see that resistance, ego, is just an extra vortex in the stream-- part of it---and that in fact there is no actual resistance at all. There is no point from which to confront life, or stand against it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- I go into the garden again. The hummingbirds are soaring up and falling in their mating dance, as if there were someone behind the bushes playing ball with them. Fruit and more wine have been put out on the table. Oranges ---transformations of the sun into its own image, as if the tree were acknowledging gratitude for warmth. Leaves, green with the pale, yellow-fresh green that I remember from the springtimes of my childhood in Kentish spinneys, where breaking buds were spotted all over the hazel branches in a floating mist. Within them, trunks, boughs, and twigs moist black behind the sunlit green. Fuchsia bushes, tangled traceries of stalks, intermingled with thousands of magenta ballerinas with purple petticoats. And, behind all, towering into the near-twilight sky, the grove of giant eucalyptus trees with their waving clusters of distinctly individual, bamboo-like leaves. Everything here is the visual form of the lilting nonsense and abandoned vocal dexterity of those Hindu musicians. I recall the words of an ancient Tantric scripture: \"As waves come with water and flames with fire, so the universal waves with us.\" Gestures of the gesture, waves of the wave---leaves flowing into caterpillars, grass into cows, milk into babies, bodies into worms, earth into flowers, seeds into birds, quanta of energy into the iridescent or reverberating labyrinths of the brain. Within and swept up into this endless, exulting, cosmological dance are the base and grinding undertones of the pain which transformation involves: chewed nerve endings, sudden electric-striking snakes in the meadow grass, swoop of the lazily circling hawks, sore muscles piling logs, sleepless nights trying to keep track of the unrelenting bookkeeping which civilized survival demands. How unfamiliarly natural it is to see pain as no longer a problem. For problematic pain arises with the tendency of self-consciousness to short-circuit the brain and fill its passages with dithering echoes---revulsions to revulsions, fears of fear, cringing from cringing, guilt about guilt---twisting thought to trap itself in endless oscillations. In his ordinary consciousness man lives like someone trying to speak in an excessively sensitive echo-chamber; he can proceed only by doggedly ignoring the interminably gibbering reflections of his voice. For in the brain there are echoes and reflected images in every dimension of sense, thought, and feeling, chattering on and on in the tunnels of memory. The difficulty is that we confuse this storing of information with an intelligent commentary on what we are doing at the moment, mistaking for intelligence the raw materials of the data with which it works. Like too much alcohol, self-consciousness makes us see ourselves double, and we mistake the double image for two selves---mental and material, controlling and controlled, reflective and spontaneous. Thus instead of suffering we suffer about suffering, and suffer about suffering about suffering. As has always been said, clarity comes with the giving up of self. But what this means is that we cease to attribute selfhood to these echoes and mirror images. Otherwise we stand in a hall of mirrors, dancing hesitantly and irresolutely because we are making the images take the lead. We move in circles because we are following what we have already done. We have lost touch with our original identity, which is not the system of images but the great self-moving gesture of this as yet unremembered moment. The gift of remembering and binding time creates the illusion that the past stands to the present as agent to act, mover to moved. Living thus from the past, with echoes taking the lead, we are not truly here, and are always a little late for the feast. Yet could anything be more obvious than that the past follows from the present like the wake of a ship, and that if we are to be alive at all, here is the place to be? Evening at last closes a day that seemed to have been going on since the world began. At the high end of the garden, above a clearing, there stands against the mountain wall a semicircle of trees, immensely tall and dense with foliage, suggesting the entrance grove to some ancient temple. It is from here that the deep blue-green transparency of twilight comes down, silencing the birds and hushing our own conversation. We have been watching the sunset, sitting in a row upon the ridgepole of the great barn whose roof of redwood tiles, warped and cracked, sweeps clear to the ground. Below, to the west, lies an open sward where two white goats are munching the grass, and beyond this is Robert's house where lights in the kitchen show that Beryl is preparing dinner. Time to go in, and leave the garden to the awakening stars. Again music---harpsichords and a string orchestra, and Bach in his most exultant mood. I lie down to listen, and close my eyes. All day, in wave after wave and from all directions of the mind's compass, there has repeatedly come upon me the sense of my original identity as one with the very fountain of the universe. I have seen, too, that the fountain is its own source and motive, and that its spirit is an unbounded playfulness which is the many-dimensioned dance of life. There is no problem left, but who will believe it? Will I believe it myself when I return to normal consciousness? Yet I can see at the moment that this does not matter. The play is hide- and-seek or lost-and-found, and it is all part of the play that one can get very lost indeed. How far, then, can one go in getting found? As if in answer to my question there appears before my closed eyes a vision in symbolic form of what Eliot has called \"the still point of the turning world.\" I find myself looking down at the floor of a vast courtyard, as if from a window high upon the wall, and the floor and the walls are entirely surfaced with ceramic tiles displaying densely involved arabesques in gold, purple, and blue. The scene might be the inner court of some Persian palace, were it not of such immense proportions and its colors of such preternatural transparency. In the center of the floor there is a great sunken arena, shaped like a combination of star and rose, and bordered with a strip of tiles that suggest the finest inlay work in vermilion, gold, and obsidian. Within this arena some kind of ritual is being performed in time with the music. At first its mood is stately and royal, as if there were officers and courtiers in rich armor and many- colored cloaks dancing before their king. As I watch, the mood changes. The courtiers become angels with wings of golden fire, and in the center of the arena there appears a pool of dazzling flame. Looking into the pool I see, just for a moment, a face which reminds me of the Christos Pantocrator of Byzantine mosaics, and I feel that the angels are drawing back with wings over their faces in a motion of reverent dread. But the face dissolves. The pool of flame grows brighter and brighter, and I notice that the winged beings are drawing back with a gesture, not of dread, but of tenderness---for the flame knows no anger. Its warmth and radiance---\"tongues of flame infolded\"---are an efflorescence of love so endearing that I feel I have seen the heart of all hearts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- * \"Self-conscious man thinks he thinks. This has long been recognized to be an error, for the conscious subject who thinks he thinks is not the same as the organ which does the thinking. The conscious person is one component only, a series of transitory aspects, of the thinking person.\" L. L. Whyte, The Unconscious Before Freud (Basic Books, New York, 1960), p. 59. (back) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Epilogue ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- THIS IS, as I have said, a record not of one experiment with consciousness-changing drugs, but of several, compressed for reasons of poetic unity into a single day. At the same time I have more or less kept to the basic form which every individual experiment seems to take---a sort of cycle in which one's personality is taken apart and then put together again, in what one hopes is a more intelligent fashion. For example, one's true identity is first of all felt as something extremely ancient, familiarly distant ---with overtones of the magical, mythological, and archaic. But in the end it revolves back to what one is in the immediate present, for the moment of the world's creation is seen to lie, not in some unthinkably remote past, but in the eternal now. Similarly, the play of life is at first apprehended rather cynically as an extremely intricate contest in one-upmanship, expressing itself deviously even in the most altruistic of human endeavors. Later, one begins to feel a \"good old rascal\" attitude toward the system; humor gets the better of cynicism. But finally, rapacious and all-embracing cosmic selfishness turns out to be a disguise for the unmotivated play of love. But I do not mean to generalize. I am speaking only of what I have experienced for myself, and I wish to repeat that drugs of this kind are in no sense bottled and predigested wisdom. I feel that had I no skill as a writer or philosopher, drugs which dissolve some of the barriers between ordinary, pedestrian consciousness and the multidimensional superconsciousness of the organism would bring little but delightful, or sometimes terrifying, confusion. I am not saying that only intellectuals can benefit from them, but that there must be sufficient discipline or insight to relate this expanded consciousness to our normal, everyday life. Such aids to perception are medicines, not diets, and as the use of a medicine should lead on to a more healthful mode of living, so the experiences which I have described suggest measures we might take to maintain a sounder form of sanity. Of these, the most important is the practice of what I would like to call meditation---were it not that this word often connotes spiritual or mental gymnastics. But by meditation I do not mean a practice or exercise undertaken as a preparation for something, as a means to some future end, or as a discipline in which one is concerned with progress. A better word may be \"contemplation\" or even \"centering,\" for what I mean is a slowing down of time, of mental hurry, and an allowing of one's attention to rest in the present---so coming to the unseeking observation, not of what should be, but of what is. It is quite possible, even easy, to do this without the aid of any drug, though these chemicals have the advantage of \"doing it for you\" in a peculiarly deep and prolonged fashion. But those of us who live in this driven and over-purposeful civilization need, more than anyone else, to lay aside some span of clock time for ignoring time, and for allowing the contents of consciousness to happen without interference. Within such timeless spaces, perception has an opportunity to develop and deepen in much the same way that I have described. Because one stops forcing experience with the conscious will and looking at things as if one were confronting them, or standing aside from them to manage them, it is possible for one's fundamental and unitive apprehension of the world to rise to the surface. But it is of no use to make this a goal or to try to work oneself into that way of seeing things. Every effort to change what is being felt or seen presupposes and confirms the illusion of the independent knower or ego, and to try to get rid of what isn't there is only to prolong confusion. On the whole, it is better to try to be aware of one's ego than to get rid of it. We can then discover that the \"knower\" is no different from the sensation of the \"known,\" whether the known be \"external\" objects or \"internal\" thoughts and memories. In this way it begins to appear that instead of knowers and knowns there are simply knowings, and instead of doers and deeds simply doings. Divided matter and form becomes unified pattern-in-process. Thus when Buddhists say that reality is \"void\" they mean simply that life, the pattern-in-process, does not proceed from or fall upon some substantial basis. At first, this may seem rather disconcerting, but in principle the idea is no more difficult to abandon than that of the crystalline spheres which were once supposed to support and move the planets. Eventually this unified and timeless mode of perception \"caps\" our ordinary way of thinking and acting in the practical world: it includes it without destroying it. But it also modifies it by making it clear that the function of practical action is to serve the abiding present rather than the ever-receding future, and the living organism rather than the mechanical system of the state or the social order. In addition to this quiet and contemplative mode of meditation there seems to me to be an important place for another, somewhat akin to the spiritual exercises of the dervishes. No one is more dangerously insane than one who is sane all the time: he is like a steel bridge without flexibility, and the order of his life is rigid and brittle. The manners and mores of Western civilization force this perpetual sanity upon us to an extreme degree, for there is no accepted corner in our lives for the art of pure nonsense. Our play is never real play because it is almost invariably rationalized; we do it on the pretext that it is good for us, enabling us to go back to work refreshed. There is no protected situation in which we can really let ourselves go. Day in and day out we must tick obediently like clocks, and \"strange thoughts\" frighten us so much that we rush to the nearest head-doctor. Our difficulty is that we have perverted the Sabbath into a day for laying on rationality and listening to sermons instead of letting off steam. If our sanity is to be strong and flexible, there must be occasional periods for the expression of completely spontaneous movement---for dancing, singing, howling, babbling, jumping, groaning, wailing---in short, for following any motion to which the organism as a whole seems to be inclined. It is by no means impossible to set up physical and moral boundaries within which this freedom of action is expressible---sensible contexts in which nonsense may have its way. Those who provide for this essential irrationality will never become stuffy or dull, and, what is far more important, they will be opening up the channels through which the formative and intelligent spontaneity of the organism can at last flow into consciousness. This is why free association is such a valuable technique in psychotherapy; its limitation is that it is purely verbal. The function of such intervals for nonsense is not merely to be an outlet for pent-up emotion or unused psychic energy, but to set in motion a mode of spontaneous action which, though at first appearing as nonsense, can eventually express itself in intelligible forms. Disciplined action is generally mistaken for forced action, done in the dualistic spirit of compelling oneself, as if the will were quite other than the rest of the organism. But a unified and integrated concept of human nature requires a new concept of discipline---the control, not of forced action, but of spontaneous action. It is necessary to see discipline as a technique which the organism uses, as a carpenter uses tools, and not as a system to which the organism must be conformed. Otherwise the purely mechanical and organizational ends of the system assume greater importance than those of the organism. We find ourselves in the situation where man is made for the Sabbath, instead of the Sabbath for man. But before spontaneous action can be expressed in controlled patterns, its current must be set in motion. That is to say, we must acquire a far greater sensitivity to what the organism itself wants to do, and learn responsiveness to its inner motions. Our language almost compels us to express this point in the wrong way ---as if the \"we\" that must be sensitive to the organism and respond to it were something apart. Unfortunately our forms of speech follow the design of the social fiction which separates the conscious will from the rest of the organism, making it the independent agent which causes and regulates our actions. It is thus that we fail to recognize what the ego, the agent, or the conscious will is. We do not see that it is a social convention, like the intervals of clock time, as distinct from a biological or even psychological entity. For the conscious will, working against the grain of instinct, is the interiorization, the inner echo, of social demands upon the individual coupled with the picture of his role or identity which he acquires from parents, teachers, and early associates. It is an imaginary, socially fabricated self working against the organism, the self that is biologically grown. By means of this fiction the child is taught to control himself and conform himself to the requirements of social life. At first sight this seems to be an ingenious and highly necessary device for maintaining an orderly society based upon individual responsibility. In fact it is a penny-wise, pound-foolish blunder which is creating many more problems than it solves. To the degree that society teaches the individual to identify himself with a controlling will separate from his total organism, it merely intensifies his feeling of separateness, from himself and from others. In the long run it aggravates the problem that it is designed to solve, because it creates a style of personality in which an acute sense of responsibility is coupled with an acute sense of alienation. The mystical experience, whether induced by chemicals or other means, enables the individual to be so peculiarly open and sensitive to organic reality that the ego begins to be seen for the transparent abstraction that it is. In its place there arises (especially in the latter phases of the drug experience) a strong sensation of oneness with others, presumably akin to the sensitivity which enables a flock of birds to twist and turn as one body. A sensation of this kind would seem to provide a far better basis for social love and order than the fiction of the separate will. The general effect of the drugs seems to be that they diminish defensive attitudes without blurring perception, as in the case of alcohol. We become aware of things against which we normally protect ourselves, and this accounts, I feel, for the high susceptibility to anxiety in the early phases of the experience. But when defenses are down we begin to see, not hallucinations, but customarily ignored aspects of reality---including a sense of social unity which civilized man has long since lost. To regain this sense we do not need to abandon culture and return to some precivilized level, for neither in the drug experience nor in more general forms of mystical experience does one lose the skills or the knowledge which civilization has produced. I have suggested that in these experiences we acquire clues and insights which should be followed up through certain forms of meditation. Are there not also ways in which we can, even without using the drugs, come back to this sense of unity with other people? The cultured Westerner has a very healthy distaste for crowds and for the loss of personal identity in \"herd- consciousness.\" But there is an enormous difference between a formless crowd and an organic social group. The latter is a relatively small association in which every member is in communication with every other member. The former is a relatively large association in which the members are in communication only with a leader, and because of this crude structure a crowd is not really an organism. To think of people as \"the masses\" is to think of them by analogy with a subhuman style of order. The corporate worship of churches might have been the natural answer to this need, were it not that church services follow the crowd pattern instead of the group pattern. Participants sit in rows looking at the backs of each other's necks, and are in communication only with the leader ---whether preacher, priest, or some symbol of an autocratic God. Many churches try to make up for this lack of communion by \"socials\" and dances outside the regular services. But these events have a secular connotation, and the type of communion involved is always somewhat distant and demure. There are, indeed, discussion groups in which the leader or \"resource person\" encourages every member to have his say, but, again, the communion so achieved is merely verbal and ideational. The difficulty is that the defended defensiveness of the ego recoils from the very thing that would allay it---from associations with others based on physical gestures of affection, from rites, dances, or forms of play which clearly symbolize mutual love between the members of the group. Sometimes a play of this kind will occur naturally and unexpectedly between close friends, but how embarrassing it might be to be involved in the deliberate organization of such a relationship with total strangers ! Nevertheless, there are countless associations of people who, claiming to be firm friends, still lack the nerve to represent their affection for each other by physical and erotic contact which might raise friendship to the level of love. Our trouble is that we have ignored and thus feel insecure in the enormous spectrum of love which lies between rather formal friendship and genital sexuality, and thus are always afraid that once we overstep the bounds of formal friendship we must slide inevitably to the extreme of sexual promiscuity, or worse, to homosexuality. This unoccupied gulf between spiritual or brotherly love and sexual love corresponds to the cleft between spirit and matter, mind and body, so divided that our affections or our activities are assigned either to one or to the other. There is no continuum between the two, and the lack of any connection, any intervening spectrum, makes spiritual love insipid and sexual love brutal. To overstep the limits of brotherly love cannot, therefore, be understood as anything but an immediate swing to its opposite pole. Thus the subtle and wonderful gradations that lie between the two are almost entirely lost. In other words, the greater part of love is a relationship that we hardly allow, for love experienced only in its extreme forms is like buying a loaf of bread and being given only the two heels. I have no idea what can be done to correct this in a culture where personal identity seems to depend on being physically aloof, and where many people shrink even from holding the hand of someone with whom they have no formally sexual or familial tie. To force or make propaganda for more affectionate contacts with others would bring little more than embarrassment. One can but hope that in the years to come our defenses will crack spontaneously, like eggshells when the birds are ready to hatch. This hope may gain some encouragement from all those trends in philosophy and psychology, religion and science, from which we are beginning to evolve a new image of man, not as a spirit imprisoned in incompatible flesh, but as an organism inseparable from his social and natural environment. This is certainly the view of man disclosed by these remarkable medicines which temporarily dissolve our defenses and permit us to see what separative consciousness normally ignores---the world as an interrelated whole. This vision is assuredly far beyond any drug-induced hallucination or superstitious fantasy. It wears a striking resemblance to the unfamiliar universe that physicists and biologists are trying to describe here and now. For the clear direction of their thought is toward the revelation of a unified cosmology, no longer sundered by the ancient irreconcilables of mind and matter, substance and attribute, thing and event, agent and act, stuff and energy. And if this should come to be a universe in which man is neither thought nor felt to be a lonely subject confronted by alien and threatening objects, we shall have a cosmology not only unified but also joyous. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---\n"}], [{"score": 336.3677, "uuid": "cd3b8790-b5b9-53fa-8a36-ec33367c8942", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900wb-92-14581", "target_hostname": "www.greeningofgavin.com", "target_uri": "http://www.greeningofgavin.com/2008_10_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 2.4232776e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "The Greening <em>of</em> Gavin: October 2008", "snippet": "The technical <em>term</em> <em>is</em> a secure Virtual Private Network tunnel <em>or</em> VPN, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> basically a way <em>of</em> encrypting company data over a public network (the internet).", "explanation": null, "document": "Written by Gavin Webber\nI do like a great video, especially one with a very good message pertinent to reducing carbon emissions.\nThis one caught me totally unaware, and is very clever, with a high impact message.

Easy to cleanse, store information/energy in, program or amplify energy and is used as a healing instrument. The natural tendency for quartz is for harmony. Quartz can both draw and send energy therefore it is effective for sending/receiving guidance. Quartz is used for transformation in healing and in all levels of change (mentally/emotionally, physically and spiritually). Quartz stimulates the natural crystal in body tissues and fluids to resonate at the highest healing frequency. Quartz works with All Chakra and master gland for balancing, cleansing and healing. It is the perfect stone for complete Aura balancing .\nSelenite:\nProperties : This crystal is Gypsum. This white/clear striated crystal can look like snowy mountains or tumbled snowballs! Selenite is wonderful for mental focus, growth, luck, immunity, kundalini. These are centuries-old recordkeepers of events and information. Smoothes emotions.

The ends are sliced off so that you can see into it's deep translucent center. These \"picture window\" crystals are originally from the riverbeds of Brazil. The crystals are washed down out of the mountains and tumbled over and over by violent surging waters. This natural process gives the crystals their frosted look. They are the \"gazing\" stone, also called \"seer quartz\". These stone evoke clarity, clear thinking and renowned insight.\nWinter Detoxification\nDetoxifying is the process of releasing accumulated toxins and waste products that build up throughout our system. From birth, we are bombarded by toxins, externally from environmental sources. Internally, our organs give off waste products that accumulate in our body. Imbalanced emotions also play a part in polluting our system with excess chemicals such as free radicals, homocysteine and cortisol.\nDetoxifying is, in many ways, an easy process. Our body does much of the detoxification process through urination, defecation and perspiration. As our bodies age and our immune systems weaken from illness, poor diet and/or addictive substances, we sometimes need to give our system an extra helping hand. That is why conscious detoxing is great way back to optimum health.\nOne of the best ways to start your detoxification is with the body's biggest organ, the SKIN. A detox diet strengthens the organs involved in detoxification and releases stored toxins, expelling them through the organs of elimination: the skin, as well as the intestines, liver, lungs, kidneys, and lymphatic system.\nTIPS FOR DETOXING\n1. Eating a diet that focuses on fresh vegetables and fruits .\n2. Eat whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds.\n3. Adopt a healthy lifestyle including regular exercise .\n5. Taking a high potency multiple vitamin and mineral supplement.\n6. Take nutritional/herbal supplements to protect and enhance liver function.\n7. Go on a three day fast, four times per year.\n8. Fasting at the change of the seasons is a good rule to remember.\n9. Take care of your skin and know your skin type.\n10. Consider a self empowering affirmation to clear your mind.\nWinter Foot, Hair and Nail Care\nWinter is the time when our feet are always covered up. Sweaty feet, cold feet, uncomfortable boots, shoes that don't fit, manmade boots and materials, so, take your shoes off. Sit back and work on those two feet and make them beautiful!\nNow, more than ever, is the time to take care of those tootsies! Bones form the basic structure of our feet. There are 26 bones in each foot alone. Here are some good general tips for all feet:\n* Wash your feet daily. Rinse off all soap and dry thoroughly, especially between toes.\n* Trim nails straight across, and not too short. Don't cut out or dig at corners.\n* Do not trim, shave, or use over-the-counter medicines to dissolve corns or calluses\n* Wear clean socks or stockings, changed daily. Don't wear any that are too short or too tight.\n* Wear shoes that fit.\n* Wear shoes made of leather or canvas - not synthetics.\n* Switch shoes from day to day.\n* Use foot powder.\n* See your doctor if severe problems persist.\n* Get a manicure. Set aside twenty dollars or so to get a manicure AND pedicure. It is so worth it!\n* Scrub those feet. Make sure you are exfoliating the tops, sides, and bottoms of your feet at least twice a week in the shower.\n* Foot refresher. After soaking feet in warm water, massage feet with a mixture of 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 tablespoon crushed dried peppermint. Remove with a warm, damp washcloth.\n* Hangnails. Pierce a 400 IU-vitamin E capsule and massage a drop into hangnail to soften and speed healing.\n* Exfoliate your feet! Use a loofah sponge to exfoliate tops, sides and bottom of your feet. Remember to scrub all of your toes too.\n* After drying with a fluffy towel, apply your favorite moisturizer generously and then put on a thick (warm from the dryer) pair of socks on for a pampered feeling.\n* Give your nails a break. Take off your acrylic nails and let your fingertips breathe. It will take a while for them to recover, but it is a healthier (and less expensive) way to maintain your nails.\n* Bath Trim! After showing or bathing, trim your toenails and smooth any rough edges with a file.\n* Use a pumice stones on calluses and make it a habit to use a foot file on the bottom of your feet and heals at least once a week. This will keep your feet ready for any sandal at any time.\n* Natural nail file. Use a popsicle stick to file your natural nails.\n* To help your nail polish glide on, dip a cotton ball in a facial astringent to remove any excess oil on your nails. Your polish will go on much smoother.\nFoot calluses. Always use a pumice stone. Do not use razors or other cutters.\n* Adding an essential oil blend : after your foot care can be a rewarding massage and a great way to naturally moisturize your feet. Some great suggestions include organic coconut oil, infused with the purest of essential oils of peppermint, spearmint, tea tree, lemon, orange, lavender, geranium, cypress or basil to name a few.\n* For nails that are nourished from the inside out. Try supplementing your already healthy eating plan with MSM. This natural sulfur source from the sea speeds the growth of your hair and nails.\nMSM is methyl sulfonyl methane.\nMSM is a compound found naturally in foods such as cow's milk, meat, seafood, fruits and vegetables. MSM is thought to work by contributing sulfur. It's found in capsule or tablet forms. MSM is also available as a cream or lotion, although evidence suggests it can't be absorbed through skin.\n* Another wonderful supplement for hair and nails is biotin. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is often classified as a B-complex vitamin. It took nearly 40 years of research in order to establish it as a vitamin. Vitamin H, (the H represents \"Haar und Haut\", German words for \"hair and skin\") also considered Coenzyme R.\n* Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in the citric acid cycle, which is the process by which biochemical energy is generated during aerobic respiration.\nSigns of overt biotin deficiency include hair loss (alopecia) , conjunctivitis and dermatitis in the form of a scaly red rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and genital area. Neurologic symptoms in adults have included depression, lethargy, hallucination, and numbness and tingling of the extremities. The characteristic facial rash, together with unusual facial fat distribution, has been termed the \"biotin deficient face\". Diabetics may benefit from biotin supplementation. In both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetics, supplementation with biotin can improve blood sugar control and help lower fasting blood glucose levels, in some studies the reduction in fasting glucose exceeded 50 percent. Biotin can also play a role in preventing the neuropathy often associated with diabetes, reducing both the numbness and tingling associated with poor glucose control.\nDosage: Biotin comes in 1,000 mcg. That converts to 1 mg. It is recommended you start by taking 1 capsule per day. The following week, take 1 capsule twice a day. Evaluate how you feel as you do this. By week three you can add a mid day dose... so that would be 1 capsule, three times per day. To have an idea of its efficacy, try taking one bottle. Consider doing this three months of biotin, then give your body a rest for 30 days.\n1. Dressing for cold weather:\nWear several layers of loose fitting, lightweight clothing.\nWear mittens instead of gloves. Wear a hat.\nRemember that entrapped, insulating air, warmed by body heat is the best protection from the cold.\n2. Avoid Overexertion:\nThe strain from cold temperatures and heavy labor such as shoveling, pushing a car, or walking in deep snow may cause a heart attack in older and less physically fit individuals.\n3. Winterize Your Vehicle Early:\nBe prepared against the first blast of winter. Avoid automobile gas line freeze ups by keeping your tank greater than half full at all times. Make sure that your car has adequate antifreeze. Make sure that your tires have good traction and are inflated to the right pressure. Make sure that your heater and defroster work properly. Make sure that your battery is not more than 3 years old and that it can carry a full charge. Make sure that you have a good ice scraper.\n4. Carry a Winter-Survival Safety Kit in your vehicle:\nBring along blankets and a bright piece of cloth to tie on your antenna if you become stranded. Flashlight with spare batteries. Extra change of clothing to keep dry. Non-perishable foods such as candy bars, canned goods, or high calorie food like Power Bars. A can and waterproof matches (used to melt snow for drinking water). A compass, shovel and sand, tow rope, and jumper cables.\n5. Before traveling:\nCheck the latest road conditions before you head out into Winter weather. Let someone know where you are going and when you think you will reach your destination.\n6. If you become stranded in your vehicle during a Winter storm:\nStay in your car, truck, or minivan.\nRun the engine at 10 minute intervals for heat.\nMaintain proper ventilation by making sure the exhaust pipe is not plugged.\nLeave the windows open slightly to avoid carbon monoxide\npoisoning.\nMake yourself visible to rescuers. Tie a bright cloth to your\nantenna or door handle.\nTurn on the dome light at night, but only when running the engine.\n7. At home, do the following before Winter becomes a reality:\nHave your furnace checked before you need to use it.\nSeal any windows that you suspect allow cold air into the house with caulking or plastic.\nInclude a home safety kit that includes extra non-perishable food, medicine, and a battery operated radio.\nKeep a flashlight and extra batteries handy.\nKeep candles and matches handy for extended periods of electrical loss.\n8. If you lose heat in your home:\nSeal off any unused rooms by stuffing towels or rags in the cracks under the door.\nCover the windows with blankets or sheets at night if you have some extras available.\nUse only devices that are designed for heating indoors during as emergency heat source and handle all safety precautions.\n9. Install and test smoke alarms in your home:\nHave fire extinguishers checked to combat an accidental fire due to the use of alternative heat sources.\n10. Drink plenty of fluids:\nDrink plenty of fluids such as tea, juice and water to keep the body hydrated. This allows for soft skin and well lubricated organs as well as helps the body from drying out in winter heat.\nWinter and Traditional Chinese Medicine\nWinter. This is the time for us to rest and replenish.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers practical advice for adjusting to seasonal changes. One of the basic concepts in TCM is the 5 Element Theory of correspondences. Each element has an associated season, emotion, taste, organ...\nThe Season of Winter is associated with the element Water. The emotional aspect is Fear. The predominant taste is Salty. The associated and most effected organ in Winter are the Kidney and Urinary Bladder and the most common external element is Cold.\nStrengthening the immune system should be a part of any seasonal ritual! Any tonic formula that strengthens the kidneys and urinary bladder, nourishes the Qi and preserve our essence is appropriate. Remember, the best form of medicine, is preventative. Consider Andrew's great Winter Tonic Tea.\nAcupuncture and herbal medicine can help boost the immune system, no matter what state your body is in. If you have already caught a cold, acupuncture and herbal medicine can help with the chills, body aches, sore throat or fever in a safe, non-toxic approach that differs from the Western approach of filling the body with harmful antibiotics. It will often speed recovery time. Acupuncture does not interfere with Western medical treatment either as it provides a complement with the emphasis on treating the whole person.\nThe Kidneys and Bladder\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, The kidneys and urinary bladder are associated with Winter. They belong to the element of Water. The Kidney \"system\" as a whole, is the storage house of our vital Essence, vitality or Jing (the basic materials that make up our constitution and the reproductive fluids that create life). Libido levels, reproduction, water metabolism and the development of our overall health are associated with the health of the Kidneys. All organs are dependent on the Kidneys for proper growth, reproduction, water flow and control and the balance of \"fire and water\". The liver sends water soluble waste to the kidneys, where they are further filtered and passed through the bladder for elimination. The kidneys filter nutrients and waste from the blood.\nThe Kidney system in Chinese Medicine is associated with the development of brain tissue, blood, spinal fluid, marrow, teeth and bones. The Kidneys rule the lower body, are associated with the urinary bladder, is represented by the root of tongue and opens into the ears. Metaphysically, our kidneys are associated with the development of our Will. The kidneys are associated with the flavor of salt and represented by the color of black and/or blue. Our kidneys relate to the emotion of fear.\nSigns and symptoms of poor kidney function or yang energy deficiency due to excess cold include cold lower back, legs, incontinence, slow mental or physical movement, fluid retention of the limbs and mid-section, frequent urination and stiff, cold joints, especially the knees.\nSigns and symptoms of poor kidney function or yin energy deficiency due to excess heat include dry skin, ringing ears, water retention, night sweats, insomnia, emotional fright, constipation, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, red face , weak bones, chronic fever or sore throat, dry mouth, memory loss, hot palms/feet/chest, slow healing wounds, rashes or bumps, hair loss, weak eyes, extreme libido levels, dark urine, pre-mature ejaculation, hot flashes and a weak or sore lower back.\nThe balance of fire and water are the perfect example of the balance of Yin and Yang .\nThe Water Element\nThe element, Water is associated with the Winter season and with cold.\nThe element is associated with the kidneys and the bladder, which regulate water metabolism and to the reproductive system. There is also a strong relationship with the immune system and the ability of the body to lubricate, repair and protect itself.\nThe Water Signs of the zodiac are Cancer , Scorpio , and Pisces . Water is the symbol of our emotions. All life forms consist of water. It involves healing, compassion, reconciliation, friendship, de-stressing, insight, peace, sleep, dreams, intuition, and psychism and health and beauty. A positive water person is sensitive, caring and nurturing. Sometimes they can be a little over emotional and over dramatic in all areas of life. A good balance of water here is needed to keep so that the water person can share there true gifts.\nEmotionally, water represents taste, which is experienced on the tongue. It also represents one\u2019s taste in general and one\u2019s desire to taste or experience the world. Therefore, excess water is often equated with sensuality, possessiveness and greed.\nPsychologically, water represents a good memory. This can manifest as dwelling on the past. But the ultimate experience of water is remembering that we all share life as a common heritage. This manifests as peace, love and compassion.\nThe Sacral/Spleen/Sexual Chakra is in the second in the Chakra system and represents our emotional identity, oriented to self-gratification. The second Chakra, located in the abdomen, lower back, and sexual organs, is related to the element water, and to emotions and sexuality. It connects us to others through feeling, desire, sensation, and movement. Ideally this Chakra brings us fluidity and grace, depth of feeling, sexual fulfillment, and the ability to accept change.\nWater can be a common theme when we dream. It is the biggest indicator of our emotions. Water can be still, raging, wave-like, lapping up on a beach or dripping from a faucet. It is the ideal image for our emotions as well... anger, jealousy, grief, joy, excitement, love and sexuality. You can find out more about air in Andrew's Dream Dictionary .\nThe mysterious and amazing healing power of water has been utilized for centuries. Water cleanses, refreshes and restores all life. We are always drawn to water. Be it a soothing fountain, majestic waterfall or the churning sea. Water is a carrier. It flows. It moves along the line of least resistance to find its way to the ocean where comes and goes in the ebb and flow of tides and waves. The appeal is inexplicable! We crave water, maybe because our bodies are made up of a large percent of it. Maybe because we instinctively know how it can heal us.\nGifts of Water\n"}, {"score": 334.63004, "uuid": "6889568d-b1ce-5034-bcd6-fea35343f57a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0012wb-96-02304", "target_hostname": "wonder.cdc.gov", "target_uri": "http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/p0000029/p0000029.asp", "page_rank": 1.2076757e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Preventing Lead Poisoning <em>in</em> Young Children", "snippet": "Lead <em>in</em> foods comes from several sources <em>in</em> addition to lead solder: soil <em>in</em> <em>which</em> the <em>plant</em> <em>is</em> grown; air and rain; food processing (including lead leaching from some types <em>of</em> metal cans described above); contact with lead solder <em>or</em> <em>ceramic</em> vessels used to store the food; and contact with lead dusts", "explanation": null, "document": "Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control\nPublication date: 10/01/1991\nA STATEMENT BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION -- OCTOBER 1991\nWILLIAM L.

The recommendations continued herein are based mainly on the scientific data showing adverse effects of lead in young children at increasingly lower blood lead levels. They are tempered, however, by practical considerations, for example, of the numbers of children echo would require followup and the resources required to prevent this disease. It is possible that further scientific data and development of infrastructure and technology will result in a lowering of the blood lead level at which interventions are recommended at a future time.\nThis statement is a departure from previous ones in several ways. Perhaps most important is the emphasis on primary prevention and the need for coordination between pediatric health-care providers and public agencies. This statement reflects the vision expressed in the Department of Health and Human Services' Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Childhood Lead Poisoning, which calls for a concerted, coordinated societywide effort to eliminate this disease.\nIn writing this statement, we identified several areas where better data are needed in order to provide scientifically sound guidance. These range from evaluating the efficacy of chelation therapy at lower blood lead levels in terms of preventing the adverse effects of lead to developing science-based criteria for determining when an abated unit is cleaned up enough for rehabilitation. We hope that the appropriate research to answer such questions will be conducted in a timely manner, and we will continue to update the statement to reflect current understanding.\nWe are aware of concerns about the impact the changes in the statement will have on childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, laboratories, and pediatric health-care providers. In this new statement, we recognize the need for a transition period until we are able to implement fully the new recommendations; it will take time and a concerted effort to implement this new guidance.\nCDC is conducting several activities which bear directly on the implementation of the statement. First, as noted above, the Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Childhood Lead Poisoning was released by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, on February 21, 1991. In addition to laying out the actions needed to eliminate childhood lead poisoning, this plan describes the need for infrastructure and technology development, including for the evaluation of blood and environmental lead levels. Second, CDC is aggressively pursuing research and development efforts in collaboration with several instrument manufacturers to develop a field-rugged, relatively inexpensive, and simple-to-operate blood lead instrument, which would markedly enhance blood lead screening efforts. Initial results are encouraging, but the effort is still in the developmental stage. If all goes well, new instrumentation could be ready in 2 to 3 years. Third, we are continuing our efforts to help laboratories improve the quality of their blood lead measurements through our proficiency testing program and through our Blood Lead Laboratory Reference System. Finally, CDC also has a grant program in childhood lead poisoning prevention, through which state and local health agencies receive Federal money to screen children for lead poisoning, ensure environmental and medical followup for poisoned children, and provide education about lead poisoning. By the end of FY 1991, we will be funding 13 state and 2 city childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, and the President's budget for 1992 includes almost a doubling of the FY 1991 budget. We continue to encourage CDC-funded programs to address infrastructure issues.\nOther Federal agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have also released plans that deal with aspects of the childhood lead poisoning problem. These agencies are also working to build the needed infrastructure for and expand the scientific knowledge on reducing exposure to lead in the environment.\nI wish to thank the members of the Committee and consultants, as well as the numerous other people who assisted in the development and revision of this document. I believe this document will be a major landmark in the effort to eliminate childhood lead poisoning from the United States.\nVernon N.

Introduction\nSUMMARY\nNew data indicate significant adverse effects of lead exposure in children at blood lead levels previously believed to be safe. Some adverse health effects have been documented at blood lead levels at least as low as 10 ug/dL of whole blood .\nThe 1985 intervention level of 25 ug/dL is, therefore, being revised downwards to 10 ug/dL.\nA multitier approach to follow up has been adopted.\nPrimary prevention efforts (that is, elimination of lead hazards before children are poisoned) must receive more emphasis as the blood lead levels of concern are lowered.\nThe goal of all lead poisoning prevention activities should be to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 ug/dL. If many children in the community have blood lead levels > or = ug/dL, community wide interventions (primary prevention activities) should be considered by appropriate agencies. Interventions for individual children should begin at blood lead levels of 15 ug/dL.\nChildhood lead poisoning is one of the most common pediatric health problems in the United States today, and it is entirely preventable. Enough is now known about the sources and pathways of lead exposure and about ways of preventing this exposure to begin the efforts to eradicate permanently this disease. The persistence of lead poisoning in the United States, in light of all that is known, presents a singular and direct challenge to public health authorities, clinicians, regulatory agencies, and society.\nLEAD POISONING IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND PREVENTABLE PEDIATRIC HEALTH PROBLEMS TODAY.\nLead is ubiquitous in the human environment as a result of industrialization. It has no known physiologic value. Children are particularly susceptible to lead's toxic effects. Lead poisoning, for the most part, is silent: most poisoned children have no symptoms. The vast majority of cases, therefore, go undiagnosed and untreated. Lead poisoning is widespread. It is not solely a problem of inner city or minority children. No socioeconomic group, geographic area, or racial or ethnic population is spared.\nPrevious lead statements issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have acknowledged the adverse effects of lead at looser and looser levels. In the most recent previous CDC lead statement, published in 1985, the threshold for action was set at a blood lead level of 25 ug/dL, although it was acknowledged that adverse effects occur below that level. In the past several years, however, the scientific evidence showing that some adverse effects occur at blood lead levels at least as low as 10 ug/dL in children has become so over whelming and compelling that it must be a major force in determining how we approach childhood lead exposure.\nThis document provides guidelines on childhood lead poisoning prevention for diverse groups. Public health programs that screen children for lead poisoning look to this document for guidance on screening regimens and public health actions. Pediatricians and other health-care practitioners look to this document for information on screening and guidance on the medical treatment of poisoned children. Government agencies, elected officials, and private citizens seek guidance about what constitutes a harmful level of lead in blood what the current definition of lead poisoning is and what blood lead levels should trigger environmental and other interventions.\nIT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SELECT A SINGLE NUMBER TO DEFINE LEAD POISONING FOR THE VARIOUS PURPOSES OF ALL OF THESE GROUPS. Epidemiologic studies have identified harmful effects of lead in children at blood lead levels at least as low as 10 ug/dL. Some studies have suggested harmful effects at even lower levels, but the body of information accumulated so far is not adequate for effects below about 10 ug/dL to be evaluated definitively. As yet, no threshold has been identified for the harmful ejects of lead.\nBecause 10 ug/dL is the lower level of the range at which effects are now identified, primary prevention activities community wide environmental interventions and nutritional and educational campaigns should be directed at reducing children's blood lead levels at least to below 10 ug/dL. Blood lead levels between 10 and 14 ug /dL are in a border zone. While the overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 ug/dL, there are several reasons for not attempting to do interventions directed at individual children to lower blood lead levels of 10-14 ug/dL. First, particularly at low blood lead levels, laboratory measurements may have some inaccuracy and imprecision, so a blood lead level in this range may, in fact, be below 10 ug/dL. Secondly, effective environmental and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated. Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from the individualized follow up required by children who have higher blood lead levels.\nTHE SINGLE, ALL-PURPOSE DEFINITION OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A MULTITIER APPROACH, described in Table 1 1 . Community prevention activities should be triggered by blood lead levels > or = to 10 ug/dL. Medical evaluation and environmental investigation and remediation should be done for all children with blood lead levels > or = to 20 ug/dL. All children With blood lead levels > or = to 15 ug/dL should receive individual case management, including nutritional and educational interventions and more frequent screening. Furthermore, depending on the availability of resources, environmental investigation (including a home inspection) and remediation should be done for children with blood lead levels of 15-19 ug/dL, if such levels persist. The highest priority should continue to be the children with the highest blood lead levels.\nOther differences between the 1985 and 1991 statements are as follows:\nSCREENING TEST OF CHOICE. Because the erythrocyte protoporphyrin level is not sensitive enough to identify children with elevated blood lead levels below about 25 ug/dL, the screening test of choice is now blood lead measurement.\nUNIVERSAL SCREENING. Since virtually all children are at risk for lead poisoning, a phase in of universal screening is recommended, except in communities where large numbers or percentages of children has e been screened and found not to have lead poisoning. The full implementation of this still require the ability to measure blood lead levels on capillary samples and the availability of cheaper and easier-to-use methods of blood lead measurement.\nPRIMARY PREVENTION. Efforts need to be increasingly focused on preventing lead poisoning before it occurs. This will require community wide environmental interventions, as well as educational and nutritional campaigns.\nSUCCIMER. In January, 1991, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved succimer, an oral chelating agent, for chelation of children with blood lead levels over 45 ug/dL.\nChildhood lead poisoning prevention programs have had a tremendous impact on reducing the occurrence of lead poisoning in the United States. Because of these programs, deaths from lead poisoning and lead encephalopathy are now rare. These programs have targeted high- risk children for periodic screening; provided education to caretakers about the causes, effects, symptoms, and treatments for lead poisoning; and ensured medical treatment and environmental remediation for poisoned children. Screening and medical treatment of poisoned children avid remain critically important until the environmental sources most likely to poison children are eliminated.\nFederal regulatory and other actions have resulted in substantial progress in reducing blood lead levels in the entire U.S. population. In the last two decades, the virtual elimination of lead from gasoline has been reflected in reductions in blood lead levels in children and adults. Lead levels in food have also decreased since most manufacturers stopped using leaded solder in cans and since atmospheric deposition of lead on food crops declined as a result of reductions of lead in gasoline. In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the addition of lead to new residential paint.\nNevertheless, important environmental sources and pathways of lead remain. Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dusts and soils remain the primary sources and pathways of lead exposure for children. In addition, children continue to be exposed to lead through air, water, and food, as well as occupations and hobbies of parents and caretakers. The focus of prevention efforts, therefore, must expand from merely identifying and treating individual children to include primary prevention-preventing exposure to lead before children become poisoned. This will require a shared responsibility among many public and private agencies. Public agencies will have to work with pediatric health-care providers to identify communities with childhood lead- poisoning prevention problems and unusual sources of lead and to ensure environmental followup of poisoned children. Public housing and economic development agencies will have to integrate lead paint abatement into housing rehabilitation policies and programs. Health- care providers will need to phase in virtually universal screening of children. Public and private organizations must continue to develop economical and widely-available blood lead tests to make such screening possible. Public and private housing owners must bear a portion of the financial burden for abatement.\nThe changes in this statement are not meant to create an enormous burden on primary pediatric health-care providers. These changes will only be useful if public health and other agencies effectively complement health-care providers' activities. Several efforts have begun to increase federal support of childhood lead poisoning prevention programs and of followup activities. Ongoing efforts to develop infrastructure and technology by the public and private sectors include 1) the development of inexpensive, easy-to-use portable methods for measuring blood lead levels; 2) the development of training and certification programs for lead paint inspectors and abatement contractors; and 3) the development and testing of new abatement methods, including encapsulants. The changes in this statement are also not meant to increase the emphasis on screening of children; the long-term goal of this statement is PREVENTION. Until primary prevention of childhood lead poisoning can be achieved, however, increased screening and followup of poisoned children is essential.\nELIMINATION OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING:\nWill require efforts from both the private and public sectors.\nWill require a shift in emphasis to primary prevention.\nWill take time and resources.\nShould proceed in a rational manner, with the highest risk children being made the highest priority.\nCan be achieved.\nIn February 1991, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Childhood Lead Poisoning (HHS, 1991). This plan describes the first 5 years of a 20-year societywide effort to eliminate this disease. It places highest priority on first addressing the children at greatest risk for lead poisoning. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, 1990) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 1991) have both released plans dealing with the elimination of lead hazards. To eliminate this disease will require a tremendous effort from all levels of government as well as the private sector, but we believe that the benefits to society will be well worth it. We look forward to the day when childhood lead poisoning is no longer a public health problem.\nREFERENCES\nCDC (Centers for Disease Control).

BACKGROUND\nTHE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL CONSIDERED TO INDICATE LEAD TOXICITY HAS PROGRESSIVELY SHIFTED DOWNWARDS.\nIN GENERAL, CHILDREN ARE MORE AT RISK FOR LEAD EXPOSURE THAN ADULTS.\nLARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO HAVE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN THE TOXIC RANGE.\nThis chapter describes the health effects of lead on children and fetuses, the metabolism of lead, and the demographics of lead exposure in the United States. It explains why the definition of childhood lead poisoning is being revised.\nEFFECTS OF LEAD ON CHILDREN AND FETUSES\nLEAD AFFECTS VIRTUALLY EVERY SYSTEM IN THE BODY.\nTHE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL CONSIDERED TO INDICATE LEAD POISONING HAS FALLEN STEADILY SINCE THE 1970S.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS AT LEAST AS LOW AS 10 UG/DL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EFFECTS.\nALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF LOW-LEVEL LEAD EXPOSURE MAY NOT SEEM SEVERE IN THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD, ON A POPULATION BASIS THEY ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.\nLead is a poison that affects virtually every system in the body. It is particularly harmful to the developing brain and nervous system of fetuses and young children. The adverse effects of lead on children and adults are summarized in Figure 2 1 .\nThe risks of lead exposure are not based on theoretical calculations. They are well known from studies of children themselves and are not extrapolated from data on laboratory animals or high-dose occupational exposures.\nLEVELS OF CONCERN\nSince 1970, our understanding of childhood lead poisoning has changed substantially. As investigators have used more sensitive measures and better study designs, the generally recognized level for lead toxicity has progressively shifted downward. Before the mid-1960s, a level above 60 ug/dL was considered toxic (Chisolm and Harrison, 1956). By 1978, the defined level of toxicity had declined 50% to 30 ug/dL Figure 2 2 shows how the federal definition of an elevated blood lead level has changed over the years.\nRANGE OF EFFECTS OF LEAD\nVery severe lead exposure in children (blood lead levels 380 ug/dL) can cause coma, convulsions, and even death. Lower levels cause adverse effects on the central nervous system, kidney, and hematopoietic system. Blood lead levels as low as 10 ug/dL, which do not cause distinctive symptoms, are associated with decreased intelligence and impaired neurobehavioral development (Davis and Svendsgaard, 1987; Mushak et al., 1989). Many other effects begin at these low blood lead levels, including decreased stature or growth (Schwartz et al., 1986; Bornschein et al., 1986; Shulka et al., 1989), decreased hearing acuity (Schwartz and Otto, 1987), and decreased ability to maintain a steady posture (Bhattacharya et al., 1988). Lead's impairment of the synthesis of the active metabolite 1,25-(OH)2, vitamin D is detectable at blood lead levels of 10-15 ug/dL. Maternal and cord blood lead levels of 10-15 ug/dL appear to be associated with reduced gestational age and reduced weight at birth (ATSDR, 1988). Although researchers have not yet completely defined the impact of blood lead levels <10 ug/dL on central nervous system function, it may be that even these levels are associated with adverse effects that will be clearer with more refined research.\nSTUDIES OF LOW-LEVEL LEAD EFFECTS ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\nThe concern about adverse effects on central nervous system functioning at blood lead levels as low as 10 ug/dL is based on a large number of rigorous epidemiologic and experimental studies. In particular, recent cross-sectional and prospective studies have provided new evidence about the association between low-level lead exposure and child development.\nSeveral well-designed and carefully conducted cross-sectional and retrospective cohort studies in many different countries have been conducted (Lansdown et al., 1986; Fulton et al., 1987; Fergusson et al., 1988; Silva et al., 1988; Bergomi et al., 1989; Hansen et al., 1989; Hatzakis et al., 1989; Winneke et al., 1990; Lyngbye et al., 1990; Needleman et al., 1990; Yule et al., 1981; Lansdown et al., 1986; Hawk et al., 1986; Schroeder et al., 1985). Figure 2 3 shows the mean intelligence quotient (IQ) scores (in most cases adjusted for potential confounding factors) achieved by children with different blood lead levels from several of these studies. Some inconsistencies can be found in the results of these studies, but the weight of the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that decrements in children's cognition are evident at blood lead levels well below 25 ug/dL. No threshold for the lead-IQ relationship is discernable from these data.\nMost investigators report lower IQ scores among the more highly exposed children but these differences have not uniformly reached statistical significance (that is, p<.05). One way to synthesize the data from different studies is meta-analysis. Recent evaluation of 24 major cross-sectional studies provides strong support for the hypothesis that children's IQ scores are inversely related to lead burden (Needleman and Gatsonis, 1990).\nAlthough available evidence is not sufficient to conclude that lead-associated deficits are irreversible, a recent follow-up study reported that the educational success of a cohort of young adults was significantly inversely associated with the amount of lead in teeth they shed as first and second graders (Needleman et al., 1990). In this study, dentine lead levels above 20 ppm were associated with a seven-fold risk of not graduating from high school, a six-fold risk of having a reading disability, deficits in vocabulary, problems with attention and fine motor coordination, greater absenteeism, and lower class ranking. Although dentine lead levels did not correspond in any simple way to blood lead levels, the available preschool blood lead levels of the more highly exposed children averaged 35 ug/dL (Needleman et al., 1979). Increased circumpulpal dentine lead levels (>16 ppm) have been linked to higher rates of learning disabilities in a recent Danish study as well (Lyngbye et al., 1990).\nTo address methodological limitations of cross-sectional studies of lead and child development, a number of prospective studies were begun during the 1980s. Blood lead measurements were begun during the prenatal period and continued for several years, along with assessment of development. In several but not all cohorts, prenatal exposures have been associated with slower sensory-motor and delayed early cognitive development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Bellinger et al., 1991; Dietrich et al., 1987; Ernhart et al., 1986; Dietrich et al., 1991). With low postnatal exposures and favorable socioeconomic conditions, some of these early associations may attenuate as children grow older (Bellinger et al., 1991). In addition, several studies have noted that children's cognitive performance in the preschool period may be associated with early postnatal lead exposures (McMichael et al., 1988; Bellinger et al., 1991). It will be necessary for these prospective studies to follow their respective cohorts into the school-age years in order for the full implications of these early patterns to become clear.\nQuestions are frequently raised about the practical significance of the difference frequently observed between the IQ scores of more exposed and less exposed children. For the previously described population of children studied by Needleman et al. (Needleman et al., 1979), a shift in mean IQ score of 4-6 points as a result of lead exposure was associated with a substantial increase in the prevalence of children with severe deficits (that is, IQ scores less than 80)( Figure 2 4 ). Similarly, in this population the shift was associated with an absence of children who achieved superior function (that is, IQ scores greater than 125).\nABSORPTION OF LEAD\nCHILDREN ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR LEAD EXPOSURE BECAUSE\nThey have more hand-to-mouth activity than adults.\nThey absorb more lead than adults.\nMany factors can affect the absorption, distribution, and toxicity of lead. Children are more exposed to lead than older groups because their normal hand-to-mouth activities may introduce many nonfood items into their gastrointestinal tract (Lin-Fu, 1973). The efficiency of gastrointestinal absorption of lead in food and beverages in children has been estimated to be around 40% (Ziegler et al., 1978). From experimental studies, gastrointestinal absorption of lead from nonfood sources is decreased in the presence of food (Rabinowitz, 1980). Efficiency of absorption is probably also affected by the particle size and form of lead (Barltrop and Meek, 1979). Deficiencies in iron, calcium, protein, and zinc are related to increased blood lead levels and perhaps increased vulnerability to the adverse effects of lead (Mahaffey, 1981; Mahaffey and Michaelson, 1980).\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN THE UNITED STATES\nLarge numbers of children continue to have blood lead levels high enough to cause adverse effects.\nSubstantial progress has been made, however, in reducing blood lead levels in the United States.\nLead-based paint remains the major source of high-dose lead poisoning in the United States.\nThe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry estimated that in 1984, 17% of all American preschool children had blood lead levels that exceed 15 ug/dL (ATSDR, 1988). Although all children are at risk for lead toxicity, poor and minority children are disproportionately affected. Lead exposure is at once a by-product of poverty and a contributor to the cycle that perpetuates and deepens the state of being poor.\nSubstantial progress has been made in reducing blood lead levels in U.S. children. Perhaps the most important advance has been the virtual elimination of lead from gasoline. Close correlations have been demonstrated between the decline in the use of leaded gasoline and declines in the blood lead levels of children and adults between 1976 and 1980 (Anastate, 1983)( Figure 2 5 ). Levels of lead in food have also declined significantly, as a result both of the decreased use of lead solder in cans and the decreasing air lead levels.\nLead-based paint remains the major source of high-dose lead poisoning in the United States. Although the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) limited the lead content of new residential paint starting in 1978, millions of houses still contain old leaded paint. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that about 3.8 million homes with young children living in them have either nonintact lead- based paint or high levels of lead in dust (HUD 1990).\nREFERENCES\nATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry).

SOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF LEAD EXPOSURE\nSOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN INCLUDE:\nLead-based paint.\nFor some children, other sources and pathways, such as \"traditional\" medicines, may be critical.\nINTRODUCTION\nA child's environment is full of lead. Children are exposed to lead from different sources (such as paint, gasoline, and solder) and through different pathways (such as air, food, water, dust, and soil). Although all U.S. children are exposed to some lead from food, air, dust, and soil, some children are exposed to high dose sources of lead. Lead-based paint is the most widespread and dangerous high- dose source of lead exposure for preschool children.\nLead entering the body from different sources and through different pathways presents a combined toxicological threat (ATSDR, 1988). Multiple, low-level inputs of lead can result in significant aggregate exposure. Indeed, for children with lower (but still elevated) blood lead levels (for example, in the range of 10-20 ug/dL) identifying a single, predominant environmental source or pathway is not always possible.\nThis chapter describes the most important sources and pathways for childhood lead exposure. Information about the levels or concentrations of concern in different pathways is based on information assembled by regulatory agencies and other published data. Nothing in this chapter should be interpreted as suggesting standards for acceptable or unacceptable levels or concentrations of lead in different environmental media.\nLEAD-BASED PAINT\nLEAD-BASED PAINT IS THE MOST COMMON HIGH-DOSE SOURCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN.\nABOUT 74% OF PRIVATELY OWNED, OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS IN THE UNITED STATES BUILT BEFORE 1980 CONTAIN LEAD-BASED PAINT.\nCHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO LEAD WHEN THEY INGEST CHIPS OF LEAD-BASED PAINT OR INGEST PAINT-CONTAMINATED DUST AND SOIL.\nMANY CASES OF LEAD POISONING RESULT WHEN HOMES CONTAINING LEAD-BASED PAINT ARE REMODELED OR RENOVATED WITHOUT PRECAUTIONS BEING TAKEN.\nREMOVING LEAD FROM HOUSING IS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THE TREATMENT OF POISONED CHILDREN AND FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING.\nLead-based paint remains the most common high-dose source of lead exposure for preschool children. Lead-based paint (containing up to 50% lead) was in widespread use through the 1940s. Although the use and manufacture of interior lead-based paint declined during the 1950s and thereafter, exterior lead-based paint and lesser amounts of interior lead-based paint continued to be available until the mid-1970s (CEH/CAPP, 1987). (Lead-based paint produced after the 1940s tended to have much lower lead concentrations than lead-based paint produced earlier.) In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the manufacture of paint containing more than 0.06% lead by weight on interior and exterior residential surfaces, toys, and furniture. Unfortunately, lead-based paint that is still available for industrial, military, and marine usage occasionally ends up being used in homes.\nNationwide, about 3 million tons of lead remain in an estimated 57 million occupied private housing units built before 1980 (representing 74% of all such housing). Of particular concern are the 14 million housing units believed to contain lead paint in unsound condition and the 3.8 million deteriorated units occupied by young children (HUD, 1990).\nPica, the repeated ingestion of nonfood substances, has been implicated in cases of lead poisoning; however, a child does not have to eat paint chips to become poisoned. More commonly, children ingest dust and soil contaminated with lead from paint which flaked or chalked as it aged or which has been disturbed during home maintenance or renovation. This lead-contaminated house dust, ingested via normal repetitive hand-to-mouth activity, is now recognized as a major contributor to the total body burden of lead in children (Bornschein et al., 1986). Because of the critical role of dust as an exposure pathway, children living in sub-standard housing and in homes undergoing renovation are at particular risk for lead poisoning.\nNumerous studies have established that the risk of lead poisoning is related to the presence of lead-based paint and to the condition of such paint (ATSDR, 1988; EPA, 1986). Children who live in rehabilitated lead-free housing or who return to lead-reduced housing after undergoing medical treatment have significantly lower blood levels than children living in similar, nonrehabilitated housing (Bornschein et al., 1986; Chisolm et al., 1985). Data from several urban lead poisoning prevention programs indicate that deleading the home of a poisoned child can reduce blood lead levels substantially (Rosen et al., in press; Amitai et al., in press; G. Copley, unpublished data). Deleading or lead paint abatement can be an effective method of reducing children's exposure to dangerous levels of lead in paint and house dust if properly done (Farfel and Chisolm, in press), but may actually increase dust lead levels if not done properly (Farfel and Chisolm, 1990).\nLead paint is typically found on kitchen and bathroom walls and throughout pre-1950 homes on doors, windows, and wooden trim. The risks of lead poisoning are greater when lead paint or the underlying surface are in deteriorated condition and when lead paint (even intact paint) is located on surfaces accessible to children (EPA, 1986). Lead paint on interior and exterior window components is particularly of concern because it is abraded into dust by the repeated opening and closing of these windows (Farfel and Chisolm, 1990).\nMany cases of childhood lead poisoning that result from renovation or remodeling of homes have been reported (Marino, 1990). Before older homes undergo any renovation that may generate dust, they should be tested for the presence of lead-based paint. If such paint is found, contractors experienced in working with lead-based paint should do the renovations.\nThere is no uniform standard for safe or allowable amounts of lead in existing painted surfaces. States and the federal government use values ranging from 0.7-1.2 mg/cm2 of wall when lead is measured using a portable x-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or a standard of 0.5% lead by weight when tests are performed using laboratory analysis. These regulatory limits are based mostly on practical, not health, considerations.\nLead paint also continues to be used on the exterior of painted steel structures, such as bridges and expressways. In addition to the obvious risk to workers, increased lead absorption has been reported in children exposed to chips or dust during the deleading or maintenance of such structures (Landrigan et al., 1982).\nDeleading, even when performed in the homes of children who have already been poisoned, is an important method of primary lead poisoning prevention because it reduces or removes the lead hazard from that housing unit for all future occupants. Methods for the safe abatement of residential lead paint are detailed in Chapter 8. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has primary responsibility for issues related to lead-based paint in housing.\nSOIL AND DUST\nSoil and dust act as pathways to children for lead deposited from paint, gasoline, and industrial sources.\nThe long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different measures to reduce lead levels in soil need to be evaluated.\nReduction of dust lead is important both as part of deleading and as a means of interim risk reduction.\nSoil and dust act as pathways to children for lead deposited by primary lead sources such as lead paint, leaded gasoline, and industrial or occupational sources of lead. Since lead does not dissipate, biodegrade, or decay, the lead deposited into dust and soil becomes a long-term source of lead exposure for children. For example, although lead emissions from gasoline have largely been eliminated, an estimated 4-5 million metric tons of lead used in gasoline remain in dust and soil, and children continue to be exposed to it (ATSDR, 1988).\nBecause lead is immobilized by the organic component of soil, lead deposited from the air is generally retained in the upper 2-5 centimeters of undisturbed soil (EPA, 1986). Urban soils and other soils that are disturbed or turned under may be contaminated down to far greater depths. Soil lead levels within 25 meters of roadways are typically 30-2,000 parts per million (ppm) higher than natural levels, with some roadside soils having concentrations as high as 10,000 ppm. Soils adjacent to houses painted with exterior lead paints may also have lead levels above 10,000 ppm. Measured lead levels in soil adjacent to smelters range as high as 60,000 ppm (EPA, 1986).\nAs part of normal play and hand-to-mouth exploratory activities, young children may inhale or ingest lead from soil or dust. Ingestion of dust and soil during meals and playtime activity appears to be a more significant pathway than inhalation for young children (EPA, 1986).\nDifferent investigators have found widely varying relationships between levels of lead in soil and dust and children's blood lead levels. Blood lead levels generally rise 3-7 ug/dL for every 1,000-ppm increase in soil or dust lead concentrations (EPA, 1986; Bornschein et al., 1986; ATSDR, 1988). Particle size and the chemical form of lead may affect the bioavailability of lead in soil and dust; access to soil, behavior patterns, presence of ground cover, and a variety of other factors also influence this relationship (Barltop and Meek, 1979).\nEven if ongoing deposition of lead into soil and dust is eventually halted, measures will have to be taken to reduce exposures from lead- contaminated soils and dusts. Until data demonstrating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of permanent soil and dust abatement measures are available, interim risk reduction steps will be needed in some places. Dust control via wet mopping and frequent hand washing has been shown to reduce the blood lead levels of children with high blood lead levels (Charney et al., 1983), but this is not a permanent solution so long as the source of the lead in the dust remains. For urban and smelter communities, where outdoor soil can be a major source of lead in house dust (Diemel et al., 1981; Yankel et al., 1977), indoor dust abatement may not be effective unless abatement of soil lead is also conducted. Soil abatement may consist of either establishing an effective barrier between children and the soil or the removal and replacement of at least the top few centimeters of soil. Grass cover, if properly maintained, may be an effective means of limiting exposure to dusts originating from lead-contaminated soil (Jenkins et al., 1988).\nDRINKING WATER\nCONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER WITH LEAD USUALLY OCCURS IN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.\nSEVERAL PROPERTIES OF WATER AND ITS PATTERN OF USE AFFECT HOW MUCH LEAD CONTAMINATION RESULTS FROM A PARTICULAR WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.\nSOME PRACTICAL MEASURES CAN LOWER THE LEAD CONTENT OF DRINKING WATER.\nLead levels are typically low in ground and surface water, but may increase once the water enters the water distribution system. Contamination of drinking water can occur at five points in or near the residential, school, public, or office plumbing, including: 1) lead connectors (that is, goose necks or pigtails), 2) lead service lines or pipes, 3) lead-soldered joints in copper plumbing throughout the building, 4) lead-containing water fountains and coolers, and 5) lead-containing brass faucets and other fixtures. The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments banned the use of lead in public drinking water distribution systems and limited the lead content of brass used for plumbing to 8%.\nSeveral properties of water and its patterns of use affect the extent of lead contamination that results from a particular water delivery system. These factors include: 1) the corrosiveness of water (that is, pH, alkalinity, and mineral content), 2) age of the lead-soldered joints and other lead components (the newer ones often pose a higher risk), 3) quantity and surface area of lead materials, and 4) standing time and temperature of water in contact with leaded surfaces.\nTypically, lead pipes are found in residences built before the 1920s, with the oldest cities having the most frequent use of lead pipes. Pipes made of copper and soldered with lead came into general use in the 1950s. Overall, lead leaching from copper pipes with lead- soldered joints represents the major source of water contamination in homes and public facilities such as schools.\nIn some areas of the United States (for example, Pennsylvania), cisterns are used to store water, especially rain water that may be acidic. Cisterns also can be roof-collection systems, which are common in some island areas (for example, Hawaii, the Florida Keys). When lead solder is used either in the construction of these cisterns or to repair leaks, or the cistern has a lead liner, the potential for lead contamination of the water is substantial. If the water has a relatively low pH, has low concentrations of cations such as Ca++ or Mg+ + (that is, \"soft\" water), or has an elevated organic content, the water is probably aggressive in dissolving lead from the cistern. Corrosion control may be effective in reducing water lead levels in the case of corrosive water.\nLead in drinking water is probably absorbed more completely than lead in food. Adults absorb 35%-50% of the lead they drink, and the absorption rate for children may be greater than 60% (ATSDR, 1988).\nIn general, lead in drinking water is not the predominant source for poisoned children. In some circumstances, however, lead exposures from water are unusually high. Some water cooler-fountains have been found to have lead-soldered or lead-lined tanks. Patterns of intermittent water use from these fountains results in the water standing in the tanks longer than in typical residential situations, which can increase the amount of lead that is leached from the tanks. Several babies have been poisoned when hot tap water, which was then boiled (resulting in concentrating the lead), was used to make baby formula (J. Graef, personal communication).\nPractical measures to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water include using fully-flushed water for drinking and cooking and always drawing water for ingestion from the cold water tap. The effectiveness of many point-of-use devices (treatment devices that are installed at the tap) in reducing lead in water varies and may be affected by the location of the device in relation to the lead source and by compliance with manufacturer's use and maintenance instructions. Some, like reverse osmosis and distillation units, may be effective. Carbon, sand, and cartridge filters do not remove lead.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency regulates the permissible lead content of water.\nOCCUPATIONS AND HOBBIES\nCHILDREN MAY BE EXPOSED TO HIGH LEAD LEVELS WHEN WORKERS TAKE HOME LEAD ON THEIR CLOTHING OR WHEN THEY BRING SCRAP OR WASTE MATERIAL HOME FROM WORK.\nHOBBYISTS MAY ALSO INADVERTENTLY EXPOSE THEIR FAMILIES TO LEAD.\nTHE CURRENT OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION STANDARDS MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE HEALTH OF WORKERS.\nA variety of work and hobby environments expose people to lead and may result in lead exposures for their families. Occupations frequently reported to have resulted in adult lead poisoning are shown in Table 3 1 . Many potential hazardous activities, like furniture refinishing and making stained glass, may be either hobbies or occupations. Other activities that may be associated with lead exposure include using indoor firing ranges, doing home repairs and remodeling, and making pottery. \"Take-home\" exposures may result when workers wear their work clothes home or launder them with the family laundry or when they bring scrap or waste material home from work (Grandjean and Bach, 1986).\nStrict compliance by industrial operations with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSSA) General Industry Lead Standard governing lead exposures (29 CAR 1910.1026) would greatly reduce both occupational lead exposure and the associated indirect exposures in the homes of these workers. Unfortunately, not all occupational settings are covered by this regulation. Workers in construction including lead abatement workers -- are excluded from coverage under the General Industry Lead Standard; they are covered under a much weaker construction standard. Numerous workers in these work environments have been excessively exposed to lead, with construction workers particularly having a high risk of very high blood lead levels (Maizlish et al., 1990). Compliance with the OSSA comprehensive lead standard is inadequate (Landrigan, 1990; Maizlish, et al., 1990) even by those industries required to be in compliance. Furthermore, the current OSSA standard may not adequately protect the health of workers (Landrigan, 1990). OSSA plans to revise its standard within the next several years.\nAIRBORNE LEAD\nALTHOUGH LEAD USE IN GASOLINE HAS BEEN MARKEDLY REDUCED, PREVIOUS USE HAS RESULTED IN WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION OF SOIL AND DUST.\nEXCEPT AROUND POINT SOURCES, AIRBORNE LEAD IS ONLY A MINOR EXPOSURE PATHWAY.\nUntil recently, the combustion of leaded gasoline by motor vehicles was the predominant source of airborne lead in the United States. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered the reduction of almost all lead in gasoline during the 1970s and 1980s, and 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act will completely prohibit the use of lead as a gasoline additive beginning as early as January, 1992 and concluding no later than December 31, 1995. As discussed in the previous section, however, soil and dust contaminated by deposition of lead-containing particles can contain high concentrations of lead.\nExcept around point sources, like smelters and battery manufacturing plants, inhalation of airborne lead is now a minor exposure pathway for individual children. Other industrial activities may also result in localized exposures to lead, including burning solid waste in incinerators and sandblasting or demolishing bridges and other lead- painted metal structures. These localized activities, however, can be important sources of high-dose exposure.\nFOOD\nTHE QUANTITY OF LEAD IN THE U.S. DIET HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY IN RECENT YEARS.\nIMPROPERLY FIRED CERAMIC WARE, LEADED CRYSTAL, AND LEAD-SOLDERED CANS RESULT IN LEAD LEACHING INTO FOODS.\nSOME FOOD-HANDLING PRACTICES CAN INCREASE THE LEAD CONTENT OF FOODS.\nDuring the 1980s, the quantity of lead in the U.S. diet decreased markedly. \"Market basket\" data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), used to estimate typical lead intake, show that the average dietary lead intake for a 2-year-old child was about 30 ug/day in 1982, about 13 ug/day by 1985, and about 5 ug/day in the period 1986- 1988. This reduction was achieved through substantially restricted use of lead-soldered side-seam cans and the phasing out of lead as an additive in gasoline. In 1980, 47% of domestically produced food and soft drink cans were lead-soldered. By 1989 use of lead-soldered cans declined to 1.4% of domestically produced cans. Counter to this trend is the continued use of lead solder in cans of imported foods, because cans manufactured outside the United States typically continue to contain lead solder.\nLead in foods comes from several sources in addition to lead solder: soil in which the plant is grown; air and rain; food processing (including lead leaching from some types of metal cans described above); contact with lead solder or ceramic vessels used to store the food; and contact with lead dusts in the home. If lead contamination is unusually severe, the quantity of lead in the diet will be much higher than the \"Market Basket\" estimates. Examples include imported food from countries that do not restrict the use of lead solder in cans; storage of foods packaged in lead-soldered cans for over a year or so, even if the can is unopened; storage of acidic foods in ceramic containers made with improperly applied leaded glazes; and food processed with lead- contaminated water.\nUnder some circumstances, food grown in \"urban gardens\" may have an elevated lead content if the garden soil is high in lead or if there are high lead concentrations in the air or water used for irrigation. Soil conditions (for example, pH, phosphorus content, buffering capacity, and the amount of organic matter) and the type of plant have a great effect on how much lead is transferred to the plant. The amount transferred is difficult to predict because many factors affect lead uptake. It is recommended that the crops grown on contaminated soil be tested to determine their lead uptake. Such tests may be arranged through the Agriculture Extension Service, state or federal departments of agriculture, or private laboratories.\nOccasionally, food supplements can be seriously contaminated with lead. Examples have included various dietary supplements from \"natural\" sources, such as calcium supplements derived from animal bone sources.\nIn addition, some food-handling practices in the home can increase the lead content of foods and should be avoided. Foods should not be stored in unopened, lead-soldered cans for over a year or so. Foods should not be stored, even under refrigeration, in opened cans even if the can is subsequently covered. Food should be stored only in containers that do not release lead (for example, glass, stainless steel, or plastic containers). If ceramic food containers are ever used to store food, they should be made with lead-free glazes. Leaded crystal should not be used to store food for prolonged periods of time and should not be used to hold baby formula or juices.\nLead solders should never be used to repair food containers or to construct or repair cooking utensils. High lead levels may be present in hot water prepared in lead-soldered tea pots.\nOTHER SOURCES\nOTHER SOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF LEAD EXPOSURE\n\"TRADITIONAL\" MEDICINES\nCASTING AMMUNITION, FISHING WEIGHTS, OR TOY SOLDIERS\nMAKING STAINED GLASS\nREFINISHING FURNITURE\nBURNING LEAD-PAINTED WOOD\nPublished data, as well as anecdotal evidence from clinicians and others who work with lead-poisoned children, have identified a variety of other sources of concern.\nMany \"non-Western\" medicines (for example, greta and azarcon used to treat diarrhea or gastrointestinal upset) and cosmetics (for example, surma or kohl used around the eye for decorative or medicinal purposes) contain substantial quantities of lead and other metals. Rather than occurring as trace ingredients or trace contaminants, various lead compounds are used as major ingredients of traditional medicines in numerous parts of the world. \"Traditional healers,\" using non- Western pharmacopeias, manufacture these products, which are often brought to recent immigrant groups by friends and relatives. Examples of such exposures have been reported from the Arab cultures, from the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, from China, and from Latin America.\nMany hobbies can result in substantial exposures to lead. For example, molten lead can be used in casting ammunition and making fishing weights or toy soldiers; leaded solder is used in making stained glass; leaded glazes and frits are used in making pottery; and artists' paints may contain lead. Furniture refinishing may also result in lead exposure.\nIn some areas, the burning of lead-painted wood in home stoves and fireplaces is a source of lead exposure. Lead fumes are generated, ashes contaminate the home, and ashes are often disposed of in the back yard, resulting in contamination of the environment.\nFOLK REMEDIES CONTAINING LEAD INCLUDE:\nALARCON\nSOURCES OF LEAD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\nCHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS A PROBLEM WORLDWIDE.\nChildhood lead poisoning is a problem worldwide. In other parts of the world, however, predominant sources of lead are very different than in the United States. For example, leaded gasoline is still widely used in many countries and contributes to elevated blood lead levels, especially in urban children. Poorly glazed pottery leading to high food lead levels can be the most prominent source of lead in some areas, for example, in parts of Latin America. Point industrial sources may dramatically increase air and soil lead levels in parts of the world where environmental controls have not been effectively implemented, for example, in Eastern Europe. Lead contamination from cottage industries that recycle lead, often in backyards, is a problem in Central America and elsewhere. For children moving to or from the United States, an assessment of potential lead hazards requires specific knowledge of the country involved.\nREFERENCES\nATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry).

THE ROLE OF THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER\nTHE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER SHOULD:\nProvide anticipatory guidance about childhood lead poisoning and its prevention.\nProvide screening for lead poisoning following established screening schedules.\nConduct appropriate diagnostic blood lead testing in children with symptoms or signs consistent with lead poisoning or pica.\nInterpret blood lead results.\nEducate parents about reducing blood lead levels.\nCoordinate with local public health officials.\nEnsure that poisoned children receive appropriate medical, environmental, and social service followup.\nPediatric health-care providers, working as part of the public health team, must play a critical role in the prevention and management of childhood lead poisoning. Their roles include: 1) educating parents about key causes of childhood lead poisoning; 2) screening children and interpreting blood lead test results; 3) working with appropriate groups in the public and private sectors to make sure that poisoned children receive appropriate medical, environmental, and social service followup; and 4) coordinating with public health officials and others involved in lead-poisoning prevention activities.\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE\nTeaching parents about major sources of lead and how to prevent poisoning.\nTailoring guidance to likely hazards in the community.\nPediatric health-care providers consider education to be an integral part of well-child care. Along with educating parents about nutrition and developmental stages, providers should discuss the potential hazards of lead. They should focus on the major preventable sources of high-dose lead poisoning-lead-based paint and take-home exposures from parents' occupations and hobbies. Parents should be told of the potential dangers of peeling lead-based paint, the potential hazards of renovating older homes, and the need for good work practices if their occupations or hobbies expose them to lead. (These sources and pathways of exposure are discussed in Chapter 3.) Other education should be tailored to likely exposures in the community. For example, in some communities parents should be warned about the potential for lead exposure from improperly fired ceramic ware and imported pottery. Where water lead levels are a concern, parents could be advised to use only fully-flushed water (that is, water that has not been standing in pipes for a prolonged time) from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing infant formula.\nSCREENING FOR CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING\nSCREENING FOR LEAD POISONING REQUIRES\nDetermining the child's risk for high-dose lead exposure by asking a few questions.\nMeasuring blood lead levels in children who are at the greatest risk for high-dose lead poisoning when they are 6 months old.\nMeasuring blood lead levels in children who are at lower risk for high-dose lead exposure at 12-15 months of age.\nConducting necessary followup blood lead testing of children.\nThe recommended screening schedule is discussed in detail in Chapter 1.\nSince virtually all children are at risk for lead poisoning, universal screening is recommended, except in communities where large numbers or percentages of children have been screened and found not to have lead poisoning. (A more inexpensive and widely available blood lead test is under development.) Just as pediatric health-care providers ask screening questions about a child's development and eating habits, providers should also ask questions about a child's risk for high-dose lead exposure at every visit. (It is important to ask at every visit, since children's exposures may change over time.) On the basis of the parents' answers to these questions, the pediatric provider will be able to classify most children as being at either high or low risk for high-dose exposure to lead. The highest risk children should be screened starting when they are 6 months old, since that is when blood lead levels begin to rise. Lower risk children should be screened for the first time when they are 12-15 months old. Followup screening schedules should be based on the pediatric health-care provider's assessment of the child's risk for high-dose lead exposure and previous blood lead levels.\nDOING APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSTIC BLOOD LEAD TESTING\nPediatric health-care providers should include lead poisoning in the differential diagnosis of a number of conditions. These include growth failure, developmental delays, hyperactivity, behavior disorders, hearing loss, and anemia. Children with parasites may be exhibiting pica, and the pediatric health-care provider should also consider measuring blood lead levels in such children.\nINTERPRETATION OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS\nIN INTERPRETING BLOOD LEAD LEVELS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD\nUnderstand the scientific basis for concern.\nUnderstand the degree of imprecision and inaccuracy in blood lead measurements.\nExplain carefully why followup is or is not needed.\nThe studies which form the basis of our concern about childhood lead poisoning are described in Chapter 2. These studies suggest that adverse effects of lead occur at blood lead levels at least as low as 10 ug/dL The following paragraphs provide guidance on what might be told to a parent, depending on the blood lead levels of the child.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL < 10 UG/DL. A blood lead level < 10 ug/dL is not considered to be indicative of lead poisoning.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 10-14 UG/DL. Children with blood lead levels in this range are in a border zone. Since the laboratory tests for measuring blood lead levels are not as accurate and precise as we would like them to be at these levels, many of these children's blood lead levels may, in fact, be <10 ug/dL Although a detailed environmental history should be taken since an obvious remediable source of lead may be found, it is unlikely that there is a single predominant source of lead exposure for most of these children. Thus, a full home inspection is not recommended.\nIt is however, prudent to try and decrease exposure to lead with some simple instructions. (The required education can be done face-to-face or by distributing brochures or other written materials.) In addition, these children should receive followup blood lead testing in about 3 months. The adverse effects of blood lead levels of 10-14 ug/dL are subtle and are not likely to be recognizable or measurable in the individual child. It is important to make sure that these children's blood lead levels do not go up.\nEXAMPLE: Johnny was a 12 month old child without any risk factors for high-dose exposure. A capillary blood lead test was performed, and his blood lead level was 14 ug/dL His pediatrician told his mother that Johnny's blood lead test was in a kind of \"border\" zone, but that it was high enough to require careful followup. The pediatrician explained that laboratory test results have some inaccuracy and imprecision, but, nevertheless, suggested some housekeeping and nutritional interventions to reduce Johnny's exposure. Johnny had a venous blood lead measurement three months later, which was 7 ug/dL Three months after that, when Johnny was 18 months old, his blood lead level was 5 ug/dL His blood lead level was measured one year later and was 5 ug/dL and he received no further followup.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 15-19 UG/DL. Children with venous blood lead levels 15-19 ug/dL need more careful followup up. The pediatric health- care provider should take a careful history, about sources of lead exposure (Chapter 3). Parents should receive guidance about interventions to reduce blood lead levels (Educating Parents about Reducing Blood Lead Levels). Children with blood lead levels in this range are at risk for decreases in IQ of up to several IQ points and other subtle effects. The effects of lead at these levels are significant enough that the health-care provider should emphasize to parents the importance of followup screening to make sure the levels do not increase. The provider should also discuss interventions to reduce the blood lead levels. In addition, these children should receive followup testing (Chapter 6). If their blood lead levels persist at greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL, environmental investigation and remediation should be completed, if resources permit. In some communities, childhood lead poisoning prevention programs may be able to manage the environmental investigation and remediation.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 20-69 UG/DL. Children with venous blood lead levels in this range should have a full medical evaluation (Chapter 7). This includes a detailed environmental and behavioral history (asking about reading or other learning disabilities, language development, pica, etc.), a physical examination, and tests for iron deficiency. Particularly for children needing urgent medical followup (that is, blood lead level greater than or equal to 45 ug/dL), pediatric health- care providers with limited experience in treating lead poisoning should consider referring such children to a clinic with experience in managing childhood lead poisoning. These children should also have complete environmental investigations so that lead hazards can be reduced. The local public childhood lead poisoning prevention programs will often work as a team with the pediatric health-care provider and the child's family to ensure appropriate environmental followup.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 70 UG/DL. Children with blood lead levels this high constitute a medical emergency that preferably should be managed by someone with experience in treating children who are critically ill with lead poisoning. Medical and environmental management must begin immediately (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8).\nEDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT REDUCING BLOOD LEAD LEVELS\nWHAT CAN PARENTS DO TO REDUCE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS?\nHousekeeping interventions to reduce exposure to dust.\nInterventions to reduce exposure to other sources of lead.\nAttention to nutrition.\nThere are many interventions parents can use to help reduce blood lead levels. These interventions are not a substitute for lead hazard abatement.\nHOUSEKEEPING INTERVENTIONS\nParticularly in older homes, which may have been painted with lead- based paint, interventions to reduce exposure to dust may help reduce blood lead levels. These include:\nMake sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint. Pay special attention to windows and window sills and wells.\nIf the house was built before about 1960 and has hard surface floors, wet mop them at least once a week with a high phosphate solution (for example, 5-8% phosphates). (The phosphate content of automatic dish washing detergents and other cleaning substances is often listed on the label and may be high enough for this purpose. Otherwise, trisodium phosphate can be purchased in hardware stores.) Other hard surfaces (such as window sills and baseboards) should also be wiped with a similar solution. Do not vacuum hard surface floors or window sills or wells, since this will disperse dust. Vacuum cleaners with agitators remove dust from rugs more effectively than vacuum cleaners with suction only.\nWash your child's hands and face before he/she eats.\nWash toys and pacifiers frequently.\nOTHER INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO LEAD\nIf soil around the home is or is likely to be contaminated with lead (for example, if the home was built before 1960 or the house is near a major highway), plant grass or other ground cover. Since the highest concentrations of lead in a yard tend to be near surfaces that were once painted with lead paint, like exterior walls, if exterior lead paint was likely to be used, plant bushes around the outside of sour house so sour child cannot play there.\nIn areas where the lead content of water exceeds the drinking water standard, use only fully flushed water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and making formula. In communities where water conservation is a concern, use the first-flush water for other purposes.\nDo not store food in open cans, particularly if the cans are imported.\nDo not use pottery or ceramic ware that was inadequately fired or is meant for decorative use for food storage or service.\nMake sure that take-home exposures are not occurring from parental occupations or hobbies (Chapter 3).\nNUTRITION\nMake sure your child eats regular meals, since more lead is absorbed on an empty stomach.\nMake sure your child's diet contains plenty of iron and calcium.\nEXAMPLES OF SOURCES OF IRON AND CALCIUM\nIRON\nCOORDINATING WITH PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICIALS\nPUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SHOULD TELL THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER ABOUT\nThe magnitude of the childhood lead poisoning problem in the provider's community.\nUnusual sources of lead exposure in the provider's community.\nPublic sector services that can be used to ensure appropriate followup for poisoned children.\nInterventions being conducted through public sector actions for children with lead poisoning.\nPEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS SHOULD NOTIFY PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICIALS ABOUT\nPoisoned children they identify.\nUnusual sources or pathways of exposure they identify.\nThe responsibilities of public sector officials are described in Chapter 5. These officials are an important source of information for the pediatric health-care provider. They can alert the provider to the extent of the lead poisoning problem in the provider's catchment area. They can provide information about particular lead sources that may be of concern in a given neighborhood. Often these officials can assist in the management of the lead-poisoned child, doing followup screening, conducting environmental investigations, and ensuring lead hazards are abated. They should keep the provider informed of actions they take on the child's behalf. The pediatric health-care provider is responsible for informing public health officials about lead-poisoned children, reporting any unusual sources or pathways of exposure, and reporting elevated blood lead levels, if this is required.\nAPPROPRIATE FOLLOWUP\nReferral to infant stimulation or child development programs, if appropriate.\nReferral for social services.\nNot all aspects of a poisoned child's followup will be managed by the pediatric health-care provider, although the provider is an important part of the team. Through his or her interactions with the child and family and the responsible public health agency, the provider should make sure that any appropriate interventions are occurring. The provider should make sure that the family receives education about childhood lead poisoning and ways of preventing it, and he or she should make sure that the child receives the appropriate followup blood lead testing. If the child needs a medical evaluation (for a blood lead level greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL) or pharmacologic treatment (Chapter 7), either the provider should do it or should refer the child to a place that treats large numbers of poisoned children. The provider should make sure that the child receives an appropriate environmental investigation and remediation with the help of the public health agencies. Particularly if the child is developmentally delayed, the provider should refer the child to an appropriate infant stimulation or child development program. In many cases, lead-poisoned children and their families will also benefit from social services followup.\nCHAPTER 5. THE ROLE OF STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES\nA variety of local, state and federal agencies play a role in preventing childhood lead poisoning. Pediatric health-care providers and parents should know about what these agencies do so that they can use these resources effectively. In turn, these agencies must coordinate their activities to ensure that all aspects of childhood lead poisoning prevention-health, housing, and environment being addressed, and to provide the most comprehensive and cost effective services to at-risk children, their parents, and their health-care providers.\nGovernment operations vary widely from state to state. In some states, city or local government takes the leading role in providing public health services such as lead poisoning prevention. In other states, county or state agencies take the lead role. Similarly, housing and environmental agencies with responsibility for addressing lead hazards may exist at the local, county, or state level.\nPUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES\nTHE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY SHOULD:\nEnsure that necessary screening services are provided.\nAnalyze surveillance and other data to identify exposure patterns and high-risk populations.\nDevelop and implement a primary prevention plan that focuses on the highest risk sources and populations.\nCoordinate prevention activities with other pertinent health, housing, and environmental agencies.\nEnsure that medical and environmental followup services for poisoned children are provided.\nIn most cities and some towns, counties, and states, lead poisoning prevention programs are included within the public health department or agency. Traditionally, these programs have focused on screening for lead poisoning and ensuring medical or environmental followup for children identified as being poisoned. Many also undertake public education activities, but, historically, lack of resources has limited these agencies' ability to focus on primary prevention.\nA comprehensive, multifaceted approach to preventing childhood lead poisoning would include screening and surveillance, risk identification, primary prevention activities, interagency coordination, and services for poisoned children.\nSCREENING\nAs explained in Chapter 6, screening children for lead poisoning is important both to identify poisoned children and to provide data that can be used to target community wide interventions. Public health agencies should have the primary responsibility for ensuring that children receive necessary blood lead screening. While it is not realistic for public agencies to actually perform most of the required screening, these agencies must work with individual and institutional pediatric health care providers to ensure that the private sector provides as much screening as possible. Screening by public agencies should focus on children who would not otherwise receive it in the private sector.\nSURVEILLANCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nBefore a public health agency can design and implement a primary prevention plan, the agency must assess the sources of lead in the community, exposure patterns, and high-risk populations. The lead public health agency should generally take responsibility for the types of risk assessment activities described in Chapter 9, soliciting cooperation and assistance from housing and environmental agencies when appropriate. As explained in Chapter 9, blood lead screening provides data for assessing the extent and nature of a given community's lead problem. Public health agencies should also take the lead in conducting or coordinating the collection of the environmental, housing, and demographic data needed to undertake a community-based risk assessment.\nPRIMARY PREVENTION\nOne of the most important themes of this document is the need to identify and remove sources of exposure to lead before children are harmed, that is, the need for primary prevention. Public health agencies must take a leading role in designing and implementing primary prevention programs. One important activity for public health agencies is to use the data collected from screening and surveillance to develop a primary prevention plan designed to target resources to the most pervasive sources and the highest risk populations.\nINTERAGENCY COORDINATION\nPublic health agencies cannot be expected to implement primary prevention activities by themselves. Many steps that must be taken lie within the expertise or jurisdiction of other government agencies, especially those dealing with housing or the environment. To prevent lead poisoning, all public agencies with a connection to this problem need to be enlisted in the effort. The activities of different types of agencies at different levels of government must be coordinated, preferably through formal arrangements under which the different agencies meet and consult. Public health agencies should take the lead in organizing interagency task forces or committees and in ensuring that all involved agencies communicate regularly.\nPROVIDING SERVICES TO POISONED CHILDREN\nPublic health agencies have traditionally been responsible for ensuring that lead-poisoned children receive appropriate medical and environmental followup, often through a formal case-management system. Until lead poisoning has successfully been eradicated, public health agencies will have to devote much of their lead-poisoning prevention resources to case management services for poisoned children.\nHOUSING AGENCIES\nWork with public health agencies to provide needed housing and environmental services to poisoned children.\nEnforce code requirements regarding lead hazards.\nAssist public health agencies in educating property owners, tenants, real estate professionals, and building contractors about lead hazards in housing.\nUse regulations and policies to increase the amount of safe and effective abatement performed.\nMost states, and some cities and counties, have agencies with the responsibility for regulating housing quality or developing policies to ensure that people are provided with safe and affordable housing. As the focus shifts from severely poisoned children to lead hazards in children's environments, the role of housing agencies will expand. A comprehensive, multifaceted role for housing agencies would include providing services to poisoned children; enforcing housing codes; educating the public; and making regulations and policies to increase the number of safe and effective abatements.\nENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES\nParticipate in interagency efforts to prevent lead poisoning.\nAdopt a multimedia approach to addressing environmental lead hazards.\nUndertake monitoring, regulatory, licensing, and enforcement activities to reduce environmental exposure to lead.\nMost states, and some cities and counties, have agencies responsible for regulating exposures to toxic substances in the environment. Traditionally, such agencies have dealt with exposure to lead in the air, in drinking water, and in hazardous and solid waste, but have had little or no role in addressing the hazards associated with lead in paint. Some environmental agencies have begun to address the problems of toxic substances in housing, such as asbestos and radon, and they may also be willing to join an interagency effort to reduce exposure to lead hazards in housing. A comprehensive, multifaceted role for environmental agencies would include participation in interagency efforts, multimedia lead hazard reduction programs, monitoring, and regulation.\nCHAPTER 6. SCREENING\nSUMMARY\nSCREENING IS IMPORTANT BOTH TO ENSURE THAT POISONED CHILDREN ARE IDENTIFIED AND TO GENERATE DATA TO TARGET PRIMARY PREVENTION ACTIVITIES.\nVIRTUALLY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR LEAD POISONING. SCREENING CHILDREN WITH HIGH PROBABILITY OF EXPOSURE TO HIGH-DOSE SOURCES IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.\nSCREENING SHOULD BE DONE USING A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nCHILDREN AT GREATEST RISK FOR HIGH-DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE SHOULD BE SCREENED MORE FREQUENTLY.\nANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECT INTERPRETATION OF BLOOD LEAD TEST RESULTS, PARTICULARLY AT LOW LEVELS.\nTraditionally, the main purpose of a childhood lead poisoning screening program has been to identify asymptomatic lead-poisoned children and to intervene as quickly as possible to reduce their blood lead levels. An additional benefit of screening programs is that abatement of lead sources for poisoned children results in prevention of lead poisoning for children who would have been exposed to those sources in the future. As the focus in lead poisoning prevention turns more to primary prevention, an additional benefit of screening is that data generated can be used in targeting interventions to places with children at high risk for lead poisoning.\nSUGGESTED PRIORITIES FOR SCREENING\nVIRTUALLY ALL U.S. CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR LEAD POISONING.\nCHILDREN AT HIGHEST RISK SHOULD BE GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR SCREENING.\nIn 1984, the last year for which estimates are available, it is believed that between 3 and 4 million children younger than age 6 years (17% of all U.S. children in this age group) had blood lead levels above 15 ug/dL (ATSDR, 1988). Furthermore, about 74% of occupied, privately owned housing built before 1980 contains lead-based paint (defined as greater than or equal to 1 milligram per square centimeter (mg/ cm2)) (HUD, 1990). BECAUSE ALMOST ALL U.S. CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR LEAD POISONING (ALTHOUGH SOME CHILDREN ARE AT HIGHER RISK THAN OTHERS), OUR GOAL IS THAT ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE SCREENED, UNLESS IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THESE CHILDREN LIVE DOES NOT HAVE A CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PROBLEM. (Deciding that no problem exists requires that a large number or percentage of children be tested. *) The full implementation of this will require the ability to measure blood lead levels on capillary samples and the availability of cheaper and easier-to-use methods of blood lead measurement. Children at highest risk for lead poisoning are the highest priority for screening. Table 6 1 provides guidance on the groups for which repeated screening is most strongly indicated.\nChildren ages 6 to 72 months who live in or are frequent visitors to deteriorated old buildings, including day care centers, make up the highest priority group. Because the highest concentrations of lead in paint were used in the early l900s, homes built before about 1960 are of greatest concern. Children whose homes are being renovated are also at extremely high risk. Since siblings, house mates, visitors, and playmates of children with confirmed lead poisoning may have similar exposures to lead, they also should be promptly screened. In communities with a high prevalence of lead poisoning, health departments should consider door-to-door screening, since many children with lead poisoning may be missed by fixed-site screening.\nChildren with parents whose work or hobbies involve lead may also risk lead exposure (Chapter 3). Also, children living near lead smelters or other industries where lead is processed may be at increased risk for lead poisoning.\nIn general, screening and assessment for lead poisoning should focus on children younger than 72 months of age, particularly on children younger than 36 months of age. Young children engage in the most hand-to-mouth activity (and therefore are at highest risk for lead exposure) and have the most rapidly developing nervous systems, making them more vulnerable to the effects of lead. Children with developmental delays, who may exhibit pica or have more extensive hand-to-mouth activity than other children, would be expected to be at increased risk for lead poisoning even if they are 72 months of age and older. These children may have to be screened more often during early infancy, and may require screening into their school years.\nChildren who have unexplained seizures, neurological symptoms, abdominal pain, or other symptoms that are consistent with lead poisoning should also have their blood lead levels measured. In addition, the possibility of lead poisoning should be considered in any child with growth failure, developmental delay, hyperactivity, behavior disorders, hearing loss, anemia, etc.\n* The health departments need to take lead role in assessing whether or not a community has a childhood lead poisoning problem.\nSCREENING METHOD\nSCREENING SHOULD BE DONE USING A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nSince erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) is not sensitive enough to identify more than a small percentage of children with blood lead levels between 10 and 25 ug/dL and misses many children with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 25 ug/dL (McElvaine et al., 1991), measurement of blood lead levels should replace the EP test as the primary screening method. Unless contamination of capillary blood samples can be prevented, lead levels should be measured on venous samples. Obtaining capillary specimens is more feasible at many screening sites. Contamination of capillary specimens obtained by finger prick can be minimized if trained personnel follow proper technique (see Appendix I for a capillary sampling protocol). Elevated blood lead results obtained on capillary specimens should be considered presumptive and must be confirmed using venous blood. At the present time, not all laboratories will measure lead levels on capillary specimens.\nPrograms will need to increase their capacity to perform blood lead testing. During the transition to the use of the blood lead test as the primary screening method, some programs will temporarily continue to use EP as a screening test. In addition, some nutrition programs (for example, the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)) use the EP test to identify children with iron deficiency.\nFor a discussion of the units used to report EP results (Page 48). All EP test results of greater than or equal to 35 ug/dL if standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1, greater than or equal to 28 ug/dL if standardized using 297 L cm-1 mmol-1, or greater than or equal to 70 umol ZnPP/mol heme, if the hematofluorometer reports in these units, must be followed by a blood lead test (preferably venous) and an evaluation for iron deficiency. Work on developing easy-to-use, cheap, portable instruments for blood lead testing is ongoing.\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE AND ASSESSING RISK\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE HELPS PREVENT LEAD POISONING BY EDUCATING PARENTS ON WAYS TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURE.\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HOUSING AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY WHICH CHILDREN ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR HIGH-DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE.\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE AND ASSESSMENT OF RISK SHOULD BE TAILORED TO IMPORTANT SOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN THE CHILD'S COMMUNITY.\nGuidance on childhood lead poisoning prevention and assessment of the risk of lead poisoning should be part of routine pediatric care. Anticipatory guidance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. The guidance and risk assessment should emphasize the sources and exposures that are of greatest concern in the child's community (Chapter 3). Because lead-based paint has been used in housing throughout the United States, in most communities it will be necessary to focus on this source.\nSCREENING SCHEDULE\nTHE SCREENING SCHEDULE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT CHILDREN'S BLOOD LEAD LEVELS INCREASE MOST RAPIDLY AT 6-12 MONTHS AND PEAK AT 18-24 MONTHS.\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE ON PREVENTING LEAD POISONING AND ASSESSING THE RISK FOR HIGH-DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE SHOULD BE PART OF ROUTINE PEDIATRIC CARE.\nTHE URGENCY AND TYPE OF FOLLOW-UP DEPENDS ON THE SCREENING BLOOD LEAD TEST RESULT.\nBACKGROUND\nThe rationale for the screening schedule is based on data such as those shown in Figure 6 1 . Those data were collected in a prospective study in Cincinnati (Clark et al., 1985). Blood lead levels were measured every 3 months from birth onward, and illustrate the trends in blood lead concentration in relation to the child's age and housing age and condition. Blood lead concentrations increase steadily up to at least 18 months of age. The most rapid rate of increase occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. The highest blood lead levels occur in children living in deteriorated older housing.\nASSESSMENT OF RISK\nTable 6 2 has sample questions. Starting at 6 months of age and at each regular office visit thereafter, pediatric health-care providers should discuss childhood lead poisoning and assess the child's risk for high-dose exposure. The questions asked should be tailored to the likely sources of exposure in the community. THE QUESTIONS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nUSING QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS\nIF ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE INDICATE THAT THE CHILD IS NOT AT HIGH RISK FOR HIGH-DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE, THE CHILD SHOULD BE SCREENED AT 12 MONTHS OF AGE, AND, IF RESOURCES ALLOW, AT 24 MONTHS OF AGE.\nIF ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE INDICATE THAT THE CHILD IS AT RISK FOR HIGH-DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE, THE CHILD SHOULD BE SCREENED STARTING AT 6 MONTHS OF AGE.\nFOR CHILDREN PREVIOUSLY AT LOW RISK, ANY HISTORY SUGGESTING THAT EXPOSURE TO LEAD HAS INCREASED SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UP WITH A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nOn the basis of responses to questions such as those in Table 6 2 , children can be categorized as low or high risk for high-dose lead exposure. If the answers to all questions are negative, the child is at low risk for high-dose lead exposure and should be screened by a blood lead test at 12 months and again, if possible, at 24 months (since blood lead levels often peak at ages greater than 12 months). If the answer to any question is positive, the child is potentially at high risk for high-dose lead exposure, and a blood lead test should be obtained. FOR CHILDREN PREVIOUSLY AT LOW RISK, ANY HISTORY SUGGESTING THAT EXPOSURE TO LEAD HAS INCREASED SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UP WITH A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nEXAMPLE: A pediatrician in southern California almost exclusively serves communities built after 1988. She is aware, however, that some of her patients' families store juice and punch in pottery imported from Mexico. In her guidance to parents, she warns them that lead can leach from improperly fired pottery. At every routine visit, she asks parents about the use of this pottery and screens any children whose parents use this pottery. In her anticipatory guidance and assessment of her patients' risks of lead poisoning, she emphasizes sources of exposure that are common in the community she serves.\nSCREENING SCHEDULE\nThe following sections provide a minimum screening schedule for children aged 6 up to 36 and 36 to 72 months. The schedule is not rigid. Rather, it is a guide for pediatric health-care providers and screening programs to use in conjunction with other pertinent information in determining when an individual child should be tested.\nCHILDREN 6 UP TO 36 MONTHS OF AGE:\nA questionnaire should be used at each routine office visit to assess the potential for high-dose lead exposure and, therefore, the appropriate frequency of screening.\nSCHEDULE IF THE CHILD IS AT LOW RISK FOR HIGH DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE BY QUESTIONNAIRE: A child at low risk for exposure to high-dose lead sources by questionnaire should have an initial blood lead test at 12 months of age. If the 12-month blood lead result is less than 10 UG/DL, the child should be retested at 24 months if possible, since that is when blood lead levels peak. If a blood lead test result is 10 -14 UG/DL, the child should be retested every 3 to 4 months. After 2 consecutive measurements are less than 10 ug/dL or three are less than 15 ug/dL, the child should be retested in a year. If any blood lead test result is greater than or equal to 15 UG/DL, the child needs individual case management, which includes retesting the child at least every 3 to 4 months.\nSCHEDULE IF THE CHILD IS AT HIGH RISK FOR HIGH DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE BY QUESTIONNAIRE: A child at high risk for exposure to high-dose lead sources by questionnaire should have an initial blood lead test at 6 months of age. If the initial blood lead result is less than 10 UG/DL, the child should be rescreened every 6 months. After 2 subsequent consecutive measurements are less than 10 ug/dL or three are less than 15 ug/dL, testing frequency can be decreased to once a year. If a blood lead test result is 10-14 UG/DL, the child should be screened every 3 to 4 months. Once 2 subsequent consecutive measurements are less than 10 ug/dL or three are less than 15 ug/dL, testing frequency can be decreased to once a year. If any blood lead test result is greater than or equal to 15 UG/DL, the child needs individual case management, which includes retesting the child at least every 3 to 4 months.\nCHILDREN GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 36 MONTHS AND LESS THAN 72 MONTHS AGE:\nAs for younger children, a questionnaire should be used at each routine office visit of children from 36 to 72 months of age. Any child at high risk by questionnaire who has not previously had a blood lead test should be tested. All children who have had venous blood lead tests greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL or who are at high risk by questionnaire should be screened at least once a year until their sixth birthday (age 72 months) or later, if indicated (for example, a developmentally delayed child with pica). Children should also be rescreened any time history suggests exposure has increased. Children with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL should receive followup as described below.\nFOLLOWUP OF CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 15 UG/DL\nFollowup of children with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL is discussed in more detail in later chapters and is briefly summarized below. In general, such children should receive blood lead tests at least every 3 to 4 months.\nIF THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL IS 15 -19 UG/DL, the child should be screened every 3-4 months, the family should be given education and nutritional counseling as described in Chapter 4, and a detailed environmental history should be taken to identify any obvious sources or pathways of lead exposure. When the venous blood lead level is in this range in two consecutive tests 3-4 months apart, environmental investigation and abatement should be conducted, if resources permit.\nIF THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 20 UG/DL, the child should be given a repeat test for confirmation. If the venous blood lead level is confirmed to be greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL, the child should be referred for medical evaluation and followup as described in Chapter 7. Such children should continue to receive blood lead tests every 3-4 months or more often if indicated. Children with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 45 ug/dL must receive urgent medical and environmental followup, preferably at a clinic with a staff experienced in dealing with this disease. Symptomatic lead poisoning or a venous blood lead concentration greater than or equal to 70 ug/dL is a medical emergency, requiring immediate inpatient chelation therapy, as described in Chapter 7.\nCLASSIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF SCREENING TEST RESULTS\nOn the basis of screening test results, children can be classified into categories according to their risk for adverse effects of lead. The urgency and type of followup are based on these risk classes. These classes are shown in Table 6 3 .\nMEASUREMENT OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS\nVENOUS BLOOD IS PREFERRED FOR BLOOD LEAD MEASUREMENT.\nANALYTICAL VARIATION IN THE LABORATORY CAN AFFECT BLOOD LEAD RESULTS.\nLABORATORIES MEASURING BLOOD LEAD LEVELS SHOULD PARTICIPATE SUCCESSFULLY IN A BLOOD LEAD PROFICIENCY TESTING PROGRAM.\nSeveral factors can influence the quality of blood lead measurements. The ubiquity of lead in the environment makes contamination of specimens during collection a major source of error. Analytical variation in the laboratory can affect results. Accuracy and precision of blood lead measurements, particularly at low concentrations, can be assured by the use of appropriate analytical standards, maintenance of equipment, training of personnel, and participation in external proficiency testing programs.\nSince blood collected by venipuncture has a low likelihood of contamination compared to blood collected by finger stick, venous blood is the preferred specimen for analysis and should be used for lead measurement whenever practicable. In addition, venous specimens provide a larger volume for analysis and are less prone to clotting and other problems that can be encountered with capillary specimens (DeSilva and Donnan, 1977; Mitchell et al., 1974).\nFingerstick specimens are acceptable for blood lead screening, provided that special collection procedures are followed to minimize the risk of contamination. Personnel must be thoroughly trained in collection procedures. A procedure for collecting finger stick specimens is described in Appendix I. At the present time, not all laboratories will accept capillary samples for blood lead analysis.\nElevated blood lead results obtained on capillary specimens are presumptive and must be confirmed using venous blood. In general, children who have blood lead levels greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL on capillary samples should have these levels confirmed on venous samples, according to the timetable in Table 6 4 . A child with a blood lead level greater than or equal to 70 ug/dL or with symptoms of lead poisoning should be treated immediately while the results of an immediate confirmatory test are awaited.\nADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nBlood lead levels can be determined by several analytic methods. The method used can affect the specimen volume required, the choice of anticoagulant (usually heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and other aspects related to specimen suitability. Specimen collection procedures and equipment must be checked for compatibility with laboratory requirements. Special lead-free evacuated tubes are available for blood collection, but standard tubes containing EDTA or heparin (lavender or green caps) can be acceptable after screening each lot to determine the lead content of the containers, needles, etc. Though reports of unsuitable levels of background lead in other collection materials are infrequent, all materials used should be determined to be lead-free before use.\nSeveral analytical techniques available can be used to make accurate blood lead measurements at levels <25 ug/dL. These techniques are electrochemical techniques, usually anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Either of these techniques is capable of achieving detection limits <2 to 5 ug/dL. Success by these methods, however, requires careful and meticulous attention to the details of the analysis.\nThe reliability of a set of blood lead measurements is greatly enhanced by the use of high quality lead standard solution for instrument calibration. In the United States, the National Institute of Science and Technology has made such a material (SRM 3121) available. In addition, a set of whole blood reference materials (SRM 955A, Lead in Blood) provides a useful set of control materials over a wide range of concentrations -- about 6 to 70 ug/dL.\nLaboratories where blood is tested for lead levels should be successful participants in a blood lead proficiency testing program, such as the program conducted jointly by CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the University of Wisconsin. In interpreting laboratory results, it should be recognized that a proficient laboratory should measure blood lead levels to within several ug/dL of the true value (for example, within 4 or 6 ug/dL of a target value). The blood lead level reported by a laboratory, therefore, may be several ug/dL higher or lower than the actual blood lead level.\nAnalytical variability must be considered when interpreting blood lead results. Changes in successive blood lead measurements on an individual can be considered significant only if the net difference of results exceeds the limit of analytic variance that the laboratory allows. As a general rule, trends should not be considered significant unless the magnitude of the change is greater than or equal to 5 ug/dL.\nThe degree of analytical variability between laboratories that employ different analytic methods usually exceeds that within a single laboratory. Therefore, a single laboratory using one analytical method should be used to best compare multiple blood lead results from an individual or a population.\nERYTHROCYTE PROTOPORPHYRIN (EP)\nEP IS NOT A SENSITIVE TEST FOR IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS BELOW ABOUT 25 UG/DL.\nAN EP LEVEL IS ELEVATED IF IT IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 35 UG/DL WHEN STANDARDIZED USING 241 L CM-1 MMOL-1, GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 28 UG/DL WHEN STANDARDIZED USING 297 L CM-1 MMOL-1, OR GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 70 UMOL/MOL WHEN MEASURED IN UMOL/MOL UNITS. ALL ELEVATED EP RESULTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY A VENOUS BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nLABORATORIES MEASURING EP LEVELS SHOULD BE SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPANTS IN AN EP PROFICIENCY TESTING PROGRAM.\nINTERPRETING EP RESULTS AND FOLLOWING UP ON CHILDREN WITH HIGH EP LEVELS.\nEP is not a sensitive test to identify children with blood lead levels below about 25 ug/dL, and therefore it is no longer the screening test of choice. Generally, EP is measured using a two-step extraction process followed by direct fluorometric measurement or by front-surface fluorometry (hematofluorometry). Most protoporphyrin in erythrocytes (about 90%) exists as zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) (Smith et al., 1980; Gotelli et al., 1980). This fraction is preferentially measured by hematofluorometers. Extraction methods measure all the protoporphyrin present, but strip the zinc from the ZnPP during the extraction process. For this reason, extraction results are sometimes referred to as {zinc} free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP). Although the chemical forms measured by the two methods differ slightly, on a weight basis they are roughly equivalent, so results reported as EP, ZnPP, or FEP all reflect essentially the same analyte (Stanton et al., 1989).\nIn the past, an absorptivity of 241 L cm-1 mmol-1 has been used to determine EP levels. Recently, however, the correct absorptivity has been determined to be 297 L cm-1 mmol-1 (Gunter et al., 1989). Use of the correct absorptivity will result in EP values about 19% lower than those standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1. Standardization of EP levels that are based on the correct absorptivity is expected to be widely adopted in 1992. Use of the correct standardization requires a change in calibration and is not simply a reduction of the screening cutoff value. Standardization criteria should also be considered when reviewing data in the literature.\nAn EP result of greater than or equal to 35 ug/dL standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1 or greater than or equal to 28 ug/dL standardized using 297 L cm-1 mmol-1 is considered elevated. ALL ELEVATED EP RESULTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH A VENOUS BLOOD LEAD TEST TO DETERMINE IF LEAD POISONING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ELEVATION. Elevated concentrations of EP also result from several health conditions other than lead intoxication, particularly iron deficiency (Reeves et al., 1984; Yip et al., 1983; Thomas et al., 1977). The iron status of children with elevated EP levels should always be determined, especially since iron deficiency and lead poisoning often coexist. In such cases, the EP may be disproportionately elevated in comparison to the blood lead level.\nSome hematofluorometers report EP levels as umol ZnPP/mol heme. For instruments that give results in these units, EP values greater than or equal to 70 umol/mol should be considered elevated and should be promptly investigated (Stanton et al., 1989).\nANALYTIC CONSIDERATIONS\nOnly fresh blood is suitable for analysis by hematofluorometer (Blumberg et al., 1977). Complete oxygenation of sample hemoglobin is necessary to prevent low results in some instruments. The hemoglobin concentration in the sample can also affect hematofluorometer EP readings. Results obtained by extraction methods are not affected by these factors and can be used to confirm hematofluorometer EP results.\nAs with lead data, analytical variance must be considered when EP data are being interpreted. If trends in EP data are to be assessed correctly, analyses should preferably be performed by a single laboratory, and the variance of the method should be known when interpreting data. As with blood lead levels, interlaboratory variance usually exceeds intralaboratory variance. The observed variance for EP is wider than that for blood lead, underscoring the importance of analytical variance in the evaluation of EP data. In addition, because of substantial intermethod differences, extraction and hematofluorometer results should not be compared when assessing trends (Mitchell and Doran, 1985; Kaul et al., 1983; Peter et al., 1978). Laboratories that test patient specimens for EP levels should be participants in one or more external proficiency testing programs.\nREFERENCES\nATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry).

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL\nSUMMARY\nCHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL NEED COMPLETE MEDICAL EVALUATIONS.\nSEVERAL PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS CAN REDUCE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS; HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS REDUCING THE CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD.\nRESEARCH AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS MAY CHANGE MANY ASPECTS OF THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF POISONED CHILDREN.\nChildren with blood lead levels between 10 ug/dL and 19 ug/dL and their siblings need followup and repeat screening as described in previous chapters. They do not, however, need medical evaluation as described in this chapter.\nThe cornerstones of clinical management are careful clinical and laboratory surveillance of the child, medical treatment when indicated, and eradication of controllable sources of environmental lead. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CASE MANAGEMENT IS TO REDUCE THE CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD.\nAll children with confirmed venous blood lead levels > or = 20 ug/dL require medical evaluation. The urgency of further medical evaluation depends on the blood lead level and whether symptoms are present.\nThe decision to institute medical management should virtually always be made on the basis of a venous blood lead measurement. No other screening test can be considered diagnostic. If the first evaluation was made on capillary blood, a confirmatory venous blood lead level must be done. Even if the first diagnostic measurement was on venous blood, it is preferable to retest before starting chelation therapy. For children with blood lead levels > or = 70 ug/dL or clinical symptoms of lead poisoning, chelation should not be postponed while awaiting results of the repeat test.\nSYMPTOMS OF LEAD POISONING\nSYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.\nSYMPTOMS OF LEAD POISONING IN A CHILD WITH AN ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL CONSTITUTE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, AND THE CHILD SHOULD BE HOSPITALIZED. Symptoms, which can mimic several other pediatric disorders, must be looked for so they are not missed (Piomelli et al.,1984).\nAcute lead encephalopathy is characterized by some or all of these symptoms: coma, seizures, bizarre behavior, ataxia, apathy, incoordination, vomiting, alteration in the state of consciousness, and subtle loss of recently acquired skills. Any one or a mixture of these symptoms, associated with an elevated blood lead level, is an acute medical emergency. Lead encephalopathy is almost always associated with a blood lead level exceeding 100 ug/dL, although, occasionally, it has been reported at blood lead levels as low as 70 Ug/dL. Even when identified and promptly treated, severe and permanent brain damage may result in 70% - 80% of children with lead encephalopathy (Perlstein and Attala, 1966). Children with symptomatic lead poisoning with or without encephalopathy represent an acute medical emergency. THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAD ENCEPHALOPATHY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHILDREN PRESENTING WITH COMA AND CONVULSIONS OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY.\nExcept for coma and seizures, symptomatic lead poisoning without encephalopathy is characterized by symptoms similar to those of lead encephalopathy. Symptomatic lead poisoning without encephalopathy is characterized by one or a combination of these symptoms: decrease in play activity, lethargy, anorexia, sporadic vomiting, intermittent abdominal pain, and constipation. These symptoms are usually associated with a blood lead levels of at least 70 ug/dL, although occasionally cases have been associated with levels as low as 50 ug/dL. If the blood lead level is below 50 ug/dL, other causes of the symptoms should be sought. SINCE ACUTE LEAD ENCEPHALOPATHY MAY DEVELOP IN ANY SYMPTOMATIC CHILD, TREATMENT AND SUPPORTIVE MEASURES MUST BE STARTED IMMEDIATELY ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS.\nEVALUATION OF THE CHILD WITH A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL > OR = 20 UG/DL\nTAKE A CAREFUL HISTORY AND DO A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.\nINCLUDE EVALUATION OF THE CHILD'S IRON STATUS AND OTHER SPECIAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nA child with a blood lead level > or = 20 ug/dL should have a pediatric evaluation, whether or not symptoms are present.\nSpecial attention should be given to:\nA detailed history, including the presence or absence of clinical symptoms, child's mouthing activities, the existence of pica, nutritional status (especially iron and calcium intake), dietary habits, family history of lead poisoning, potential sources of lead exposure (including exposure due to home renovation), and previous blood lead measurements.\nDetailed environmental and occupational histories of adults in the household or other places the child spends a lot of time.\nThe physical examination, with particular attention to the neurologic examination and psychosocial and language development. A neurobehavioral assessment may be useful in children receiving chelation therapy both at the time of diagnosis and as the child approaches school age. Findings of language delay or other problems can prompt referral to appropriate programs.\nEvaluation of iron status using measurement of iron and total iron binding capacity or of ferritin.\nIRON STATUS AND SPECIAL TESTS\nTESTS FOR IRON DEFICIENCY\nBECAUSE IRON DEFICIENCY CAN ENHANCE LEAD ABSORPTION AND TOXICITY AND OFTEN COEXISTS WITH IT, ALL CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL SHOULD BE TESTED FOR IRON DEFICIENCY. Measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte are not adequately sensitive, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) is not specific enough to diagnose iron deficiency (although EP can be used to screen for iron deficiency).\nSERUM IRON AND IRON BINDING CAPACITY (TRANSFERRIN SATURATION) AND FERRITIN are the most sensitive indicators of iron status. An abnormally low ratio of serum iron to iron binding capacity (transferrin saturation) of 0.2 is consistent with iron deficiency. The serum ferritin level, however, is the most definitive and accurate indication of overall iron status, although it is an acute phase reactant and may be falsely elevated in sick children; a value < or = 12 ug/dL indicates iron deficiency. Although all iron deficient children should receive treatment for this condition, the treatment should not be started until after chelation is completed in children receiving dimercaprol (BAL).\nEP LEVEL\nAn elevated EP level indicates impairment of the heme biosynthetic pathway. EP levels are sensitive screening tests for iron deficiency, and iron status should be assessed in any child with an elevated EP level (that is, > or = 35 ug/dL when standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1, > or = 28 ug/dL when standardized using 297 L cm-1 mmol-1, or > or = 70 umol/mol when measured in umol/mol units).\nBecause EP levels take about 2 weeks to increase, EP levels may provide an indication of the duration of lead exposure (Chisolm, 1982; Chisolm, personal communication). Similarly, monitoring the EP level after medical and environmental interventions for poisoned children may be useful. If exposure to lead has ceased, EP values elevated because of lead poisoning decline slowly over several weeks or months (Piomelli et al., 1984). A progressive decline in EP concentrations indicates that combined medical and environmental case management is Proceeding efficaciously.\nEDETATE DISODIUM CALCIUM (CANA2EDTA) PROVOCATIVE CHELATION TEST\nThe mobilization test is used to determine whether a child with an initial confirmatory blood lead level of 25 to 44 ug/dL will respond to chelation therapy with a brisk lead diuresis (Piomelli et al., 1984; Markowitz and Rosen, 1991). Because of the cost and staff time needed for quantitative urine collection, this test is used only in selected medical centers where large numbers of lead-poisoned children are treated. Children whose blood lead levels are > or = 45 ug/dL should not receive a provocative chelation test; they should be referred for appropriate chelation therapy immediately.\nThe outcome of the provocative chelation test is determined not by a decrease in the blood lead level but by the amount of lead excreted per dose of CaNa2EDTA given. This ratio correlates well with blood lead levels. In one study, almost all children with blood lead levels 45 ug/dL had positive provocative tests, 76% of the children with blood lead levels 35 to 44 ug/dL had positive test results, and 35% of the children with blood lead levels 25 to 34 ,ug/dL had positive test results (Markowitz and Rosen, 1991). This test should not be done until the child is iron replete, since iron status may affect the outcome of the test (Markowitz et al., 1990).\nCONDUCTING A CANA2EDTA PROVOCATIVE CHELATION TEST. First, a repeated baseline blood lead level must be obtained. The patient is asked to empty the bladder, and then CaNa2EDTA is administered at a dose of 500 mg/m square in 5% dextrose infused OVER 1 HOUR. (A somewhat painful but practical alternative is to administer intramuscularly the same dose mixed with procaine so that the final concentration of procaine is 0.5%.) All urine must be collected with lead-free equipment over the next 8 hours. (An 8 hour mobilization test has been shown to be as reliable as a 24-hour mobilization test (Markowitz and Rosen, 1984).) An 8-hour test can be accomplished on an out-patient basis, but the patient should not leave the clinic during this test.) In the laboratory, the urine volume should be carefully measured and stored at 20 degrees Centigrade until the lead concentration is measured. Extreme care must be taken to ensure that lead-free equipment is used.\nThe use of lead-free apparatus for urine collection is mandatory. Special lead-free collection apparatus must be used if valid test results are to be obtained. The laboratory that will perform the analysis should supply the proper collection apparatus. Preferably, urine should be voided directly into polyethylene or polypropylene bottles that have been cleaned by the usual procedures, then washed in nitric acid, and thoroughly rinsed with deionized, distilled water. For children who are not toilet trained, plastic pediatric urine collectors can be used. Urine collected in this manner should be transferred directly to the urine collection bottles.\nINTERPRETATION OF A CANA2EDTA PROVOCATIVE CHELATION TEST. To obtain the total lead excretion in micrograms, the concentration of lead in the urine (in micrograms per milliliter) is multiplied by the total urinary volume (in milliliters). The total urinary excretion of lead (micrograms) is divided by the amount of CaNa2EDTA given (milligrams) to obtain the lead excretion ratio:\nLead excreted (ug) / CaNa2EDTA given (mg)\nAn 8-hour CaNa2EDTA chelation provocative test is considered positive if the lead excretion ratio is > 0.6 (Markowitz and Rosen, 1991). Some clinicians use a cutoff of 0.5 for the lead excretion ratio (Weinberger et al., 1987). Children with blood lead levels 25 to 44 ug/dL and positive chelation test results should undergo a 5-day course of chelation.\nRegardless of age, all children with elevated blood lead values and negative provocative chelation results should have blood lead levels measured monthly. If the elevation in blood lead values persists, the CaNa2EDTA provocative test can be repeated every 1 to 3 months and interpreted according to the above guidelines.\nRADIOLOGIC EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN\nRadiologic examination of the abdomen (flat plate) may show radiopaque foreign material if the material has been ingested during the preceding 24 to 36 hours. Neither negative nor positive x-ray results are diagnostic or definitive. A flat plate of the abdomen may, however, provide information about the source of lead if paint chips or other lead objects are found.\nRADIOLOGIC EXAMINATION OF THE LONG BONES\nX-rays of the long bones are unreliable for diagnosing acute lead poisoning, and they should not be obtained on a routine basis. They may provide some indication of whether lead poisoning has occurred in the past or has been ongoing for a length of time, and this may occasionally be important. Lines of increased density in the metaphyseal plate of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula may be caused by lead which has disrupted the metabolism of bone matrix. Although these lines are sometimes called lead lines, they are areas of increased mineralization or calcification and not x-ray shadows of deposited lead.\nThe following tests are NOT indicated for the diagnosis or clinical management of lead poisoning:\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF RED CELLS FOR BASOPHILIC STIPPLING\nSince basophilic stippling is not always found in severe lead poisoning and is insensitive to lesser degrees of lead poisoning, it is not useful in diagnosis.\nTESTS OF HAIR AND FINGERNAILS FOR LEAD LEVELS\nThe levels of lead in hair or fingernails do not correlate well with blood lead levels, except in extreme cases of symptomatic lead poisoning; therefore, these tests are not useful in diagnosis. Children should never receive chelating agents on the basis of analyses of lead levels in hair or fingernails.\nPHARMACOLOGY OF CHELATING AGENTS\nTable 7 1 Several drugs are used in the treatment of lead poisoning. These drugs, capable of binding or chelating lead, deplete the soft and hard (skeletal) tissues of lead and thus reduce its acute toxicity (Chisolm, 1968; Markowitz and Rosen, 1984; Piomelli et al., 1984; Rosen et al., in press). All drugs have potential side effects and must be used with caution (Piomelli et al., 1984). The basic pharmacologic characteristics of the various drugs are described below.\nBAL\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. Two molecules of dimercaprol (BAL) combine with one atom of heavy metal to form a stable complex. BAL enhances fecal and urinary excretion of lead and diffuses well into erythrocytes. Because it is predominantly excreted in bile, BAL can be administered in the presence of renal impairment (Chisolm, 1968).\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. BAL is available only in peanut oil for intramuscular administration. It is usually given every 4 hours, although it may be given every 8 hours; dosages are discussed under the heading Treatment Guidelines for Children with Blood Lead Levels > or = 20 ug/dL.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. For patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD), some clinicians recommend that BAL should be used only in life-threatening situations because it may induce hemolysis. Medicinal iron should never be administered during BAL therapy, because the combination of iron and BAL has been implicated in serious reactions. If iron deficiency coexists, it should not be treated until after BAL therapy has been completed. In cases of extreme anemia, blood transfusions are preferable.\nBetween 30% and 50% of patients who receive BAL will experience side effects. Mild febrile reactions and transient elevations of hepatic transaminase may be observed. Other minor adverse effects include, in order of frequency, nausea and occasional vomiting, headache, mild conjunctivitis, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and salivation. Most side effects are transient and rapidly subside as the drug is metabolized and excreted. Intravenous hydration coupled with restricting oral intake can circumvent, in large part, gastrointestinal distress.\nBAL SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS OR PEANUT PRODUCTS.\nCaNa2EDTA\nOnly CaNa2EDTA can be used for treating children with lead poisoning. Na2EDTA (disodium edetate) should never be used for treating children with lead poisoning because it will induce tetany and possibly fatal hypocalcemia.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. CaNa2EDTA increases urinary lead excretion twentyfold to fiftyfold. CaNa2EDTA removes lead from the extracellular compartment only, because it does not enter cells (Osterloh and Becker, 1986).\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. The preferred route for administration of CaNa2EDTA is intravenous. CaNa2EDTA must be diluted to a concentration of <0.5% either in dextrose and water or in 0.9% saline solution. It can be given as a continuous infusion or it can be given in two divided doses a day through a heparin lock over 30 to 60 minutes. CaNa2EDTA causes extreme pain when administered intramuscularly; therefore, when given by this route, it should be mixed with procaine so that the final concentration of procaine is 0.5%. CaNa2EDTA should never be given orally because it enhances absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract.\nDosages vary by situation and are detailed under the heading Treatment Guidelines for Children with Blood Lead Levels > or = 20 ug/dL. Individual courses should be limited to 5 days and repeated courses should be given at a minimum of 2- to 5-day intervals. Particularly when CaNa2EDTA is given on an outpatient basis, some clinicians use sequential 3-day courses of treatment.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. During chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA, urine output, urine sediment, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and hepatocellular enzyme levels must be carefully monitored. The appearance of protein and formed elements in urinary sediment, and rising BUN and serum creatinine values reflect impending renal failure, the serious toxicity associated with inappropriately excessive, or prolonged administration of CaNa2EDTA. Liver transaminases may increase by the fifth day of therapy, but return to pretreatment levels within a week after treatment has ended.\nWhen CaNa2EDTA is used alone without concomitant BAL therapy, it may aggravate symptoms in patients with very high blood lead levels. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with BAL when the blood lead level is > or = 70 ug/dL or overt clinical symptoms of lead poisoning are present. In such cases, the first dose of BAL should always precede the first dose of CaNa2EDTA by at least 4 hours.\nThe kidney is the principal site of potential toxicity. Renal toxicity is dose related, reversible, and rarely (if ever) occurs at doses <1500 mg/m square when the patient is adequately hydrated. CaNa2EDTA must never be given in the absence of an adequate urine flow (Piomelli et al., 1984).\nD-PENICILLAMINE\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved D-penicillamine for the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and severe, active rheumatoid arthritis. Although not approved for this use, it is used in some centers for treating lead poisoning. Until the recent approval of succimer, it was the only commercially available oral chelating agent. It can be given over a long period (weeks to months). D-penicillamine has been used mainly for children with blood lead levels <45 ug/dL.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. D-penicillamine enhances urinary excretion of lead, although not as effectively as CaNa2EDTA. Its specific mechanism and site of action are not well understood.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. D-penicillamine is administered orally. It is available in capsules or tablets (125 mg and 250 mg). These capsules can be opened and suspended in liquid, if necessary. The usual dose is 25 to 35 mg/kg/day in divided doses. Side effects can be minimized, to an extent, by starting with a small dose and increasing it gradually, monitoring all the time for side effects. For example, 25% of the desired final dose could be given in week 1, 50% in week 2, and the full dose by week 3.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. Toxic side effects (albeit minor in most cases) occur in as many as 33% of patients given the drug (Shannon et al., 1988). The main side effects of D-penicillamine are reactions resembling those of penicillin sensitivity, including rashes, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hematuria, proteinuria, hepatocellular enzyme elevations, and eosinophilia. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are infrequent. Of most concern, however, are isolated reports of nephrotoxicity, possibly from hypersensitivity reactions. For these reasons, patients should be carefully and frequently monitored for clinically obvious side effects, and frequent blood counts, urinalyses, and renal function tests should be performed. In particular, blood counts and urinalyses should be done on day 1, day 14, day 28, and monthly thereafter. If the absolute neutrophil count falls to < 1500/ug/dL, the count should be rechecked immediately, and treatment should be stopped if it falls to < 1200/ug/dL. D-penicillamine should not be given on an outpatient basis if exposure to lead is continuing or the physician has doubts about compliance with the therapeutic regimen.\nD-PENICILLAMINE SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS WITH KNOWN PENICILLIN ALLERGY.\nSUCCIMER\nThe FDA approved succimer in January, 1991 for treating children with blood lead levels >45 ug/dL. Succimer appears to be an effective oral chelating agent. Its selectivity for lead is high, whereas its ability to chelate essential trace metals is low. Although its use to date has been limited, succimer appears to have promising potential, and a broader range of clinical research studies in children are being undertaken.\nSuccimer is chemically similar to BAL but is more water soluble, has a high therapeutic index. and is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Aposhian and Aposhian, 1990). It is effective when given orally and produces a lead diuresis comparable to that produced by CaNa2EDTA (Chisolm, 1990). This diuresis lowers blood lead levels and reverses the biochemical toxicity of lead, as indicated by normalization of circulating aminolevulinic acid dehydrase levels (Graziano et al., 1988). Succimer is not indicated for prophylaxis of lead poisoning in a lead-containing environment. AS WITH ALL CHELATING AGENTS, SUCCIMER SHOULD ONLY BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN WHO RESIDE IN ENVIRONMENTS FREE OF LEAD DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. Succimer appears to be more specific for lead than the most commonly used chelating agent, CaNa2EDTA; the urinary loss of essential trace elements (for example, zinc) appears to be considerably less with succimer than with CaNa2EDTA (Aposhian and Aposhian, 1990). The site of lead chelation by succimer is not known.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. Succimer is administered orally. It is available in 100 mg capsules. The recommended initial dose is 350 mg/m square (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours for 5 days, followed by 350 mg/m square (10 mg/kg) every 12 hours for 14 days. A course of treatment, therefore, lasts 19 days. If more courses are needed, a minimum of 2 weeks between courses is preferred, unless blood lead levels indicate the need for immediate retreatment. These doses may be modified as more experience is gained in using succimer.\nPatients who have received therapeutic courses of CaNa2EDTA with or without BAL may use succimer for subsequent treatment after an interval of 4 weeks. Data on the concomitant use of succimer and CaNa2EDTA with or without BAL are not available, and such use is not recommended.\nIf young children cannot swallow capsules, succimer can be administered by separating the capsule and sprinkling the medicated beads on a small amount of soft food or by putting them on a spoon and following with a fruit drink. Data are not available on how stable succimer is when it is suspended in soft foods for prolonged periods of time; succimer should be mixed with soft foods immediately before being given to the child.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. To date, toxicity due to succimer (transient elevations in hepatic enzyme activities) appears to be minimal (Graziano et al., 1988). The most common adverse effects reported in clinical trials in children and adults were primarily gastrointestinal and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite loss. Rashes, some necessitating discontinuation of therapy, have been reported for about 4% of patients. Though succimer holds considerable promise for the outpatient management of lead poisoning, clinical experience with succimer is limited. Consequently, the full spectrum and incidence of adverse reactions, including the possibility of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions, have not been determined.\nIf succimer is used, the following precautions must be taken:\nMonitor for side effects (especially effects on liver transaminase), the rapidity of the initial decrease in blood lead levels, and the course of the rebound in blood lead levels once treatment has ended.\nSuccimer, like other chelators, is not a substitute for effective and rapid environmental interventions. Use succimer as part of an integrated environmental and medical approach to treating patients with lead poisoning.\nDo not give succimer (or any other chelating agent) in situations where high dose lead sources are available to the child.\nIn rats, gastrointestinal absorption of lead and whole body lead retention were reduced by a single oral dose of succimer (Kapoor et al., 1989). The potential for enhancing human lead absorption from the gastrointestinal tract during the use of succimer is under study.\nChildren with blood lead levels >45 ug/dL who are being treated with succimer, should, if possible, be hospitalized until their blood lead levels fall below 45 ug/dL and the lead hazards in their homes are abated or alternative lead hazard-free housing has been identified.\nChildren with blood lead levels > or = 70 ug/dL should be immediately hospitalized. The decision to treat such children with succimer instead of CaNa2EDTA and BAL should be made with the understanding that experience with using succimer in children with these blood lead levels is limited.\nTREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MANAGING CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS REDUCING THE CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD.\nCHILDREN WITH SYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING, WITH AND WITHOUT ENCEPHALOPATHY, SHOULD BE MANAGED BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM.\nASYMPTOMATIC CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 45 UG/DL SHOULD RECEIVE CHELATION THERAPY.\nDIFFERENT CLINICAL CENTERS AND PROGRAMS USE DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS TO MEDICALLY MANAGE CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OF 25 TO 44 UG/DL.\nTHE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MANAGING OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS REDUCING THE CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD; SOME CHILDREN, HOWEVER, WILL BENEFIT FROM CHELATION THERAPY. One approach for pharmacologic treatment of children with lead poisoning follows. It is a general guide and is not the only pharmacologic regimen that can be used to treat poisoned children.\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING (WITH OR WITHOUT ENCEPHALOPATHY)\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT. Children with symptomatic lead poisoning (with or without encephalopathy) must be treated only at a pediatric center that has an intensive care unit. They should be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes, as needed, critical care, toxicology, neurology, and neurosurgery. The child's neurological status and fluid balance must be carefully monitored.\nThe symptoms associated with lead poisoning (with or without lead encephalopathy) are described under the heading Symptoms of Lead Poisoning. One or more of those symptoms associated with an elevated blood lead level constitutes an acute medical emergency. Because chelation regimens are the same for cases of symptomatic lead poisoning (with and without encephalopathy), guidelines for clinical management have been included in a single section.\nCHELATION THERAPY. Although succimer has been approved for chelation of children with blood lead levels >45 ug/dL, experience in treating symptomatic children is limited. Therefore, the treatment regimen discussed here uses CaNa2EDTA and BAL. Chelation with succimer is discussed under the heading Succimer.\nStart treatment with a dose of 75 mg/m square BAL only, given by deep intramuscular injection; administer BAL at a dose of 450 mg/m square/day in divided doses of 75 mg/m square every 4 hours. Once this dose is given and an adequate urine flow is established, administer CaNa2EDTA at a dose of 1,500 mg/m square/day. Give CaNa2EDTA as a continuous intravenous infusion in dextrose and water or in a 0.9% saline solution. The concentration of CaNa2EDTA should not exceed 0.5% in the parenteral fluid. (When treating a child with encephalopathy, the physician may choose to give CaNa2EDTA intramuscularly to reduce the amount of fluid administered.) Treat with combined BAL-CaNa2EDTA therapy for a total of 5 days. During treatment, monitor renal and hepatic function and serum electrolyte levels daily (Piomelli et al., 1984).\nA second course of chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA alone (at blood lead levels 45 - 69 ug/dL) or combined with BAL (at blood lead levels 70 ug/dL), may be required once there is a rebound in the blood lead level after chelation. Wait at least 2 days before giving a second course of chelation. A third course is required only if the blood lead concentration rebounds to a value > 45 ug/dL within 48 hours after the second course of treatment. Unless there are unusual and compelling clinical reasons, wait at least 5 to 7 days before beginning a third course of CaNa2EDTA (Piomelli et al., 1984).\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING\nClinical management of asymptomatic lead-poisoned children with blood lead levels high enough to require chelation is similar to that of symptomatic children. Focus on reducing the child's exposure to lead and decreasing the child's body burden of lead.\nAlthough succimer has been approved for chelation of children with blood lead levels > 45 ug/dL, experience with this drug is limited. Therefore, the treatment regimen discussed here uses CaNa2EDTA and BAL.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL > OR = 70 UG/DL. Children with blood lead levels > or = 70 ug/dL (with or without symptoms) represent an acute medical emergency. If the blood lead level is > or = 70 ug/dL, give both BAL and CaNa2EDTA in the same doses and using the guidelines as for treatment of symptomatic lead poisoning (discussed under the heading Treatment Guidelines for Children with Blood Lead Levels > or = 20 ug/dL. ). A second course of chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA alone may be required if the blood lead concentration rebounds to a value > or = 45 ug/dL within 5 to 7 days after treatment. In general allow at least 5 to 7 days before beginning a second course of CaNa2EDTA. Some practitioners give a second course of chelation after a 3-day rest period if the immediate post-treatment blood lead level is >35 ug/dL (J. Chisolm, personal communication).\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 45 TO 69 UG/DL. If the blood lead value is between 45 and 69 ug/dL, chelation treatment should be limited to CaNa, EDTA only. CaNa2EDTA is given for 5 days at a dose of 1,000 mg/m square/ day intravenously by continuous infusion or in divided doses, as described under the heading CaNa2EDTA. During treatment, evaluate renal and hepatic function and serum electrolyte levels regularly. Do not continue CaNa2EDTA treatment for more than 5 days (Piomelli et al., 1984).\nA second course of chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA alone may be required if the blood lead level rebounds to 45 ug/dL within 7 to 14 days after treatment. Allow 5 to 7 days before beginning a second course of CaNa2EDTA.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 25 TO 44 UG/DL. For this blood lead range, the effectiveness of chelation therapy in decreasing the adverse effects of lead on children's intelligence has not been shown. Treatment regimens vary from clinic to clinic. Some practitioners treat children with lead levels in this range pharmacologically. (Although it is not approved for this use, some use D-penicillamine for children in this blood lead range.) The minimum medical management for children with these blood lead levels is to decrease the children's exposure to all sources of lead, to correct any iron deficiency and maintain an adequate calcium intake, and to test frequently to ensure that the child's blood lead levels are decreasing. Many experienced practitioners decide whether to use chelation therapy on the basis of the results of carefully performed CaNa2EDTA mobilization tests (See Edetate Disodium Calcium (CaNa2EDTA) Provactive Chelation Test).\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 20 TO 24 UG/DL. ONLY VERY MINIMAL DATA EXISTS ABOUT CHELATING CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS BELOW 25 UG/DL, AND SUCH CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE CHELATED EXCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF APPROVED CLINICAL TRIALS. A child with a confirmed blood lead level of 20 to 24 ug/dL will require individual case management by a pediatric health-care provider. The child should have an evaluation with special attention to nutritional and iron status. The parents should be taught about: 1) the causes and effects of lead poisoning, 2) the need for more routine blood lead testing, 3) possible sources of lead intake and how to reduce them, 4) the importance of adequate nutrition and of foods high in iron and calcium, and 5) resources for further information. (This is described in more detail in Chapter 4.) Sequential measurements of blood lead levels along with review of the child's clinical status should be done at least every 3 months. Iron deficiency should be treated promptly. Children with blood lead levels in this range should be referred for environmental investigation and management. IDENTIFYING AND ERADICATING ALL SOURCES OF EXCESSIVE LEAD EXPOSURE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERVENTION FOR DECREASING BLOOD LEAD LEVELS (CHAPTER 8).\nPOST-CHELATION FOLLOWUP\nRECHECK BLOOD LEAD LEVELS 7 TO 21 DAYS AFTER TREATMENT. DETERMINE IF RETREATMENT IS NECESSARY.\nDO NOT DISCHARGE A CHILD FROM THE HOSPITAL UNTIL A LEAD FREE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE ASSURED.\nAt the end of each treatment cycle, the blood lead concentration usually declines to <25 ug/dL. Within a few days, however, reequilibration among body lead compartments takes place and may result in a rebound; thus, THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL MUST BE RECHECKED 7 TO 21 DAYS AFTER TREATMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER RETREATMENT IS NECESSARY (Piomelli et al., 1984; Chisolm et al., 1985).\nChildren who undergo chelation treatment require long-term followup preferably from pediatric health-care providers, nutritionists, environmental specialists, and community out-reach workers. Community outreach workers provide a critical bridge between hospital-based or clinic-based (outpatient) medical care, health advocacy education, and environmental remediation outside the hospital. Children should NEVER be discharged from the hospital UNTIL THEY CAN GO TO A LEAD-FREE ENVIRONMENT (CDC, 1985; Piomelli et al., 1984). Lead-free safe housing (with friends, relatives, or in designated transitional housing), in which a treated child can live during the entire abatement process through the post-abatement clean-up, must be arranged. With appropriately carried-out public health measures, complete and safe abatement should be achieved during the treatment period (CDC, 1985).\nOnce a child is discharged to a safe environment, frequent followup is mandatory. In general, depending on the initial blood lead value, most children who require chelation therapy must be followed closely for at least one year or more. All children undergoing chelation treatment should be seen every other week for 6-8 weeks, then once a month for 4-6 months. A child treated with BAL and CaNa2EDTA should be followed more closely: weekly for 4 to 6 weeks, then monthly for 12 months.\nAt each clinic visit, housing information should be updated. If history suggests that exposure is increasing or if blood lead levels are rising, the dwelling must be reinspected to evaluate the possibility of new sources of environmental lead, inadequate abatement, or unsound structures in buildings (for example, poor plumbing with leaks) that cause further chipping or breakdown of a previously repaired dwelling (Piomelli et al., 1984).\nRESEARCH AREAS AND FUTURE TRENDS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING\nFURTHER EVALUATION IS NEEDED ON:\nXRAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) MEASUREMENTS OF LEAD IN BONE.\nEFFICACY OF CHELATING AGENTS IN REDUCING THE ADVERSE NEUROBEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF LEAD.\nUSES OF SUCCIMER.\nTOXICITY OF CANA2EDTA AND OTHER CHELATING AGENTS.\nBONE LEAD MEASUREMENTS USING XRAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF)\nAccording to published data, L-line and the K-line XRF techniques permit non-invasive assessment of skeletal lead stores. These bone stores reflect the lead burden accumulated over an individual's life. In contrast, blood lead values reflect recent lead exposure and absorption during the past 1 to 3 months and provide limited information about lead toxicokinetics over time (Rabinowitz et al., 1977). Evaluations using the L-line methodology in children have shown that blood lead levels underestimate the body burden of lead in lead-poisoned children (Rosen et al., in press); and sequential measurements of lead in lead-poisoned children by the L-line technique have shown decreases in bone lead after CaNa2EDTA treatment or environmental intervention (Rosen et al., in press). K-line techniques have been used mainly to measure bone lead levels in workers. Quantitation of bone lead content of children takes about 16 minutes.\nAt present, XRF equipment is available only in a few centers in the United States and Europe.\nEFFICACY OF CHELATING AGENTS\nThe benefits of chelation therapy in symptomatic lead-poisoned children are well known (Chisolm, 1968). Prompt intervention with chelating agents prevents progression to symptomatic disease and normalizes biochemical indices of lead toxicity. However, the efficacy of chelating agents in reversing or modifying the adverse neurobehavioral effects at all blood lead levels in apparently asymptomatic children needs to be carefully assessed. Better understanding of this issue is critical in deciding the end-point of medical treatment. It is also essential in defining when chelation should be used.\nSUCCIMER\nData are needed on the tissue sites of lead chelated by succimer, the adverse effects of succimer, the effect of succimer on absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract, and the effectiveness of different dose regimens of succimer. Assuming that no new significant adverse effects are noted after succimer is used more widely, the efficacy and appropriate use of succimer for treating lead-poisoned children with blood lead levels below 45 ug/dL needs to be established.\nTOXICITY OF CaNa2EDTA\nResults of one animal study suggest that CaNa2EDTA may transiently increase brain lead levels (Cory-Slechta et al., 1987). The redistribution of lead during chelation needs further study.\nREFERENCES\nAposhian HV, Aposhian MM.

MANAGEMENT OF LEAD HAZARDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD\nSUMMARY\nTO ERADICATE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING, LEAD HAZARDS MUST BE ABATED.\nENVIRONMENTAL CASE MANAGEMENT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ACTIONS PRESCRIBED FOR A CHILD WITH LEAD POISONING.\nPRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT ABATEMENT IS CONDUCTED IN THE SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE.\nEradicating childhood lead poisoning requires a long-term active program of primary lead-poisoning prevention, including abatement of lead-based paint hazards in homes, day-care centers, and other places where young children play and live. For the child who is lead poisoned, however, efficient and effective interventions are needed as quickly as possible. Abatement means making the source of lead inaccessible to the child.\nLead-based paint is the most common source of high-dose lead poisoning. Complete abatement of lead-based paint means eliminating all lead- based paint in a housing unit as a source of lead for the child, either by removing the paint or by using permanent barriers. Complete abatement of the lead hazards in the child's environment is the most effective and only certain way to prevent further damage. Complete abatement is expensive, but once a dwelling is abated, many generations of children may live in that home and reap the benefits. Unfortunately, complete abatement may not always be possible, and shorter term, preventive maintenance procedures may have to be undertaken to minimize the potential for further damage.\nLead-based paint is rarely completely abated in many of the largest childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. Instead, various degrees of incomplete abatement -- designed to eliminate the worst hazards and prevent near-term exposures -- are conducted. Development of cost- effective, safe, simple, and widely applicable methods of complete paint abatement is a high priority.\nWhether complete abatement or preventive maintenance is done, persons performing the work should be knowledgeable of the hazards of lead to themselves, to children, and to the environment. They should be trained in the proper procedures for abatement and preventive maintenance, since improperly performed work can actually increase the hazards to the child.\nEach situation in which a child gets poisoned is unique and must be evaluated by a person or team of persons skilled and knowledgeable about lead poisoning, hazard identification, and interventions to reduce lead exposure, including abatement of lead-based paint in housing. Childhood lead poisoning prevention programs need to work closely with other relevant agencies (for example, housing and environmental agencies) to ensure that the quickest and most effective approach is taken to remediating the environments of poisoned children.\nThe 1985 CDC statement on Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children set the level for environmental intervention at 25 ug/dL. In this new statement CDC recommends environmental intervention for children with blood lead levels of > or = 20 ug/dL, or of > or = 15 ug/dL that persist. Where resources are limited, however, individual environmental intervention must first focus on those children with the highest blood lead levels. CDC also recommends that environmental interventions be directed at primary prevention of lead poisoning in communities with a large number or percentage of children with blood lead levels > or = 10 ug/dL (Chapter 9).\nWHEN RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, ENVIRONMENTAL INTERVENTION MUST FIRST FOCUS ON THOSE CHILDREN WITH THE HIGHEST BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. WHEN POSSIBLE, ABATEMENT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF LEAD POISONING.\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued Lead-Based Paint Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public and Indian Housing, hereafter called the HUD Guidelines (HUD, 1990, also published in the Federal Register 55FR14556). (The worker protection guidance was subsequently revised and published in the Federal Register, 55FR39873.) This document is referenced frequently in this chapter because it contains the most comprehensive information on identifying and abating lead-based paint hazards available. It is not expected that every childhood lead poisoning prevention program or every homeowner will follow the guidelines completely. These guidelines were written for lead hazards in public and Indian housing, particularly for use during comprehensive modernization programs. Such programs, carried out when the property is vacant and in multiple units at one time, offer opportunities for very thorough and complete abatements. Most abatement of lead-based paint in the private sector does not occur in such a context. In the private sector, abatement is generally done in occupied housing scattered throughout an area, often with limited resources. In the context of this chapter, the HUD guidelines are an information source on identifying and abating hazards.\nENVIRONMENTAL CASE MANAGEMENT\nEDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT THE SOURCES, EFFECTS, AND PREVENTION OF LEAD POISONING.\nINVESTIGATING THE ENVIRONMENT TO IDENTIFY LEAD SOURCES AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION.\nTAKING EMERGENCY MEASURES TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURE.\nDOING LONG-TERM INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURE.\nEVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTIONS.\nEnvironmental case management includes a number of actions prescribed for a child with lead poisoning. Ideally, environmental case management should be conducted by a team of professionals in public health, environmental activities, medical management, and social management. A team approach to intervention will help ensure that followup is timely and effective. The management team may need to solve many related problems, such as whether to investigate supplemental addresses, where to find temporary alternative housing, and how to use community resources to assist the family in dealing with the lead-poisoned child.\nA team approach to case management is most effective when all team members:\nDemonstrate professionalism.\nShow genuine concern for the poisoned child and family.\nSupport other team members.\nUse similar terms, descriptions, and reference points to communicate with the child's family.\nMeet specific time frames for followup.\nReinforce education of the family at every encounter.\nTIME FRAMES FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND INTERVENTIONS\nThe following guidelines describe the maximum time within which environmental interventions should be implemented. All children with blood lead levels > or = 20 ug/dL should have environmental interventions conducted as quickly as possible. Children with blood lead levels > or = 45 ug/dL require prompt chelation therapy. THE HOMES OF THESE CHILDREN MUST BE REMEDIATED BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 70 UG/DL. Children with blood lead levels above 69 ug/dL constitute a medical emergency and must be hospitalized immediately. They are at highest risk for severe, permanent neurologic damage due to lead exposure and must be given highest priority for followup. Environmental investigation and intervention should be started within 24-48 hours and should include the child's home and potential sites of exposure, such as a relative's home or a day-care center. The homes of these children must be remediated before they are allowed to return.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS BETWEEN 45 AND 69 UG/DL. These children can be given a slightly lower intervention priority than the children classified as medical emergencies. Environmental investigation and intervention should begin within 5 working days and should include the same components as for children with higher blood lead levels. The homes of these children must be remediated before they are allowed to return.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS BETWEEN 20 AND 44 UG/DL. Environmental investigation and intervention should begin within 10 working days. Since many of these children will not be hospitalized and since allowing exposures to continue might lead to further increases in blood lead levels, environmental interventions for these children should be conducted as quickly as possible.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS BETWEEN 15 AND 19 UG/DL. Environmental investigation and intervention for children at this level should be based upon program resources and the ability of program staff to respond. At a minimum, these children and their families should have education regarding lead poisoning. If blood lead levels > or = 15 ug/dL persist, environmental intervention should be made where possible -- including assisting the parents in locating potential sources of lead contamination in and around the home and instructing them about how to reduce the risk of lead contamination. If resources permit, a full environmental inspection for lead-based paint should be done for such children.\nAlthough full environmental investigation and abatement is not recommended as part of the management of children with blood lead levels below 15 ug/dL, the identification and reduction of lead hazards in all high-risk housing is an important primary prevention measure (Chapter 9).\nEDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT LEAD POISONING\nThe parents of all lead-poisoned children should be educated about lead poisoning. In communities with a high incidence of lead poisoning, communitywide educational efforts should be considered. These efforts should provide information similar to that in the anticipatory guidance provided by pediatric health care providers. Information provided should include:\nCauses and effects of lead poisoning.\nRelationship of the child's blood lead level to the potential for adverse health effects.\nNeed for followup blood lead testing of the child.\nThe child's possible sources of lead intake and practical means for reducing and eliminating these sources.\nRole of nutrition in decreasing lead absorption.\nResources where parents can get further information (addresses and telephone numbers of local health-care providers or public health agencies).\nIdeally, this information should be provided during a face-to-face meeting with the parents. When local resources are limited, however, written material (in an appropriate language) may be mailed to the child's family. Educating parents about lead poisoning is further discussed in Chapter 4.\nINVESTIGATING THE ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNICATING THE RESULTS\nThe technical aspects of inspecting a home for lead-based paint are discussed below. In general, an investigation of the environment of a lead poisoned child should include the following steps:\nDetermine the most likely sources of high-dose exposure to lead.\nInvestigate the child's home to identify possible sources of lead. Include both the interior and exterior environment and give special attention to painted surfaces, dust, soil, and water. (Details on how to test for lead-based paint are in the next section.)\nAdvise parents and caretakers about identified and potential sources of lead and ways to reduce exposure.\nIn cases in which the parent does not own the home, notify the property owner immediately that a child residing on the property has lead poisoning. Discuss the results of the environmental investigation and the abatement interventions required with the property owner. Emphasize the importance of prompt abatement. When a child with a medical emergency from lead poisoning is identified, an immediate, face-to-face meeting with the property owner may best demonstrate the need for emergency intervention.\nAdvise parents and property owners that no residents or personal belongings should remain in the home during abatement.\nMonitor the effectiveness and timeliness of abatement procedures closely.\nCoordinate environmental activities with those of other professionals, including the health-care providers and persons responsible for public health and social management. A team approach to intervention will help provide a timely and effective followup.\nEMERGENCY MEASURES TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURE\nThe first phase of environmental intervention may be to use short- term emergency interventions to temporarily reduce lead hazards. As soon as a blood lead level > or = 20 ug/dL (or, if resources permit, > or = 15 ug/dL) is confirmed, parents should be advised of the hazards of lead-based paint and lead dust. They should be told not to attempt abatement themselves improper abatement will most likely increase lead dust levels in the home and create additional, more severe exposure for the child. The temporary nature of interventions other than abatement should be emphasized.\nWhen the source of lead is paint and paint-contaminated dust, parents can be instructed to stabilize the paint, wet-mop all floors, and wet-clean window sills and window wells at least twice per week. Cleaners high in phosphates appear to work particularly well. Sponges and rags used in this cleaning should be used for no other purpose. In particular, they should not be used to wash dishes or clean eating- or food-preparation surfaces, since dangerous contamination could result. Children's hands should be washed regularly, particularly before eating. Toys and pacifiers that are mouthed should be washed at least daily. Cribs and playpens should be moved away from chipping or peeling paint; furniture can be placed in front of areas that are not intact to make them less accessible. Dry sweeping of dust should be avoided, because it will stir up and spread the dust. Other measures to reduce lead exposure are discussed in Chapter 4.\nLONG-TERM MEASURES TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURE\nThe next phase of environmental intervention involves long-term hazard reduction. If the source of lead is paint and paint-contaminated dust, the lead hazards are permanently abated only when all lead- based paint is completely removed or otherwise made permanently inaccessible. Less extensive practices, which are commonly used by childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, may be called \"long term abatement.\" Certain maintenance procedures (for example, frequent cleaning and keeping walls freshly painted) may be classified as \"preventive maintenance,\" but in general these procedures offer no absolute assurance of safety. In cases other than \"permanent abatement,\" how long the hazard will remain under control depends on such factors as the quality of the workmanship, the thoroughness of the procedure, the soundness of the underlying structure, and the condition of the plumbing and roof. Moisture from leaky pipes or roofs can quickly cause paint that was smooth and intact to blister and scale, generating hazardous levels of lead dust. Except in unusual situations (such as in the case of housing that is not likely to be viable for more than a couple of years or when no alternative housing is available), temporary measures to reduce exposure should not be a substitute for abatement or an excuse for delaying abatement.\nTechnical aspects of lead-based paint abatement are discussed below.\nEVALUATING INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES\nThe effectiveness of any intervention for a lead-poisoned child should be evaluated by its impact on the child's blood lead level. Measurement of environmental lead levels may also be helpful.\nASSESSING THE LEAD PROBLEM IN THE CHILD'S COMMUNITY\nIf a number of children are identified as being lead-poisoned in a community, communitywide interventions as described in Chapter 9 should be considered.\nTESTING FOR AND ABATING LEAD-BASED PAINT\nTESTS FOR MEASURING THE LEAD CONTENT OF PAINT ON WALLS HAVE LIMITATIONS; NEW TESTS FOR EVALUATING LEAD IN PAINT ARE BEING DEVELOPED.\nPROPER ABATEMENT MUST BE DONE BY EXPERTS; UNTRAINED PARENTS, PROPERTY OWNERS, WORKERS OR CONTRACTORS SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT IT.\nNOTE: REMODELING OR REPAINTING HOMES WITH LEAD-BASED PAINT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED JUST AS HAZARDOUS AS ABATEMENT. WHENEVER LEAD-BASED PAINT MUST BE DISTURBED BY SANDING, SCRAPING, HEATING, OR OTHER FORMS OF ABRASION, THE SAME PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR REMODELING OR REPAINTING AS FOR ABATEMENT ITSELF.\nINSPECTION AND TESTING\nSeveral methods are available for determining the lead content of paint. These include XRF, wet chemical methods, and chemical spot tests. Although XRF analyzers are convenient, instruments available at the present time have limitations. A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 1989) indicated possible substrate errors in the direct- reading XRF's of as much as + or - 2 mg/square cm. These errors were caused by differences in base materials in walls and trim. (At very high readings, for example, above 3 mg/ square cm, this error has no practical significance). The spectrum analyzer, while considerably more expensive than the direct reader, provided much more accurate results. Only fully trained and experienced personnel should use XRF analyzers.\nWet chemical methods of analysis must be used if an XRF machine is not available or if it produces ambiguous results. Wet chemical methods require that a paint chip sample with all layers of paint on the surface be sent to a laboratory for analysis. Wet chemical analysis has two major disadvantages - results are not available immediately, and it is expensive.\nLike XRF, chemical spot tests are performed on-site. A scratch is made through all layers of paint, and a chemical is placed on the scratch. If the scratch turns certain colors, further evaluation is needed. Chemical spot tests are qualitative, not quantitative, and the interpretation of the results is subjective. These tests are being refined and evaluated as to their safety, accuracy, and reliability.\nFurther information on proper testing procedures for lead-based paint is in the NIST study report and the HUD Guidelines.\nThe 1985 CDC statement on lead recommended an XRF value of 0.7 mg/ square cm as the maximum level of lead in paint in a residence. The HUD standard, mandated by Congress, is 1.0 mg/square cm. Several states have established their own XRF standards for lead in paint; these standards range from 0.7 mg/square cm to 1.2 mg/square cm. The HUD document and some state regulations use a standard of 0.5% lead by weight for laboratory analysis.\nLead in paint should always be considered a \"potential\" hazard. An immediate lead hazard exists when lead-based paint is: 1) chipping, peeling or flaking; 2) is chalking, thereby producing lead dust; 3) is on a part of a window which is abraded through the opening and closing of the window; 4) is on any surface which is walked on (like floors) or otherwise abraded; 5) can be mouthed by a child (for example, window sills); or 6) is disturbed by repainting or remodeling. A potential lead hazard can easily become an immediate hazard through natural aging, plumbing or roof leaks, or the paint being disturbed. All lead-based paint exceeding the action level should, therefore, be abated whenever possible. Otherwise, complicated records must be kept of unabated surfaces, and those surfaces must be inspected frequently to make certain that they have not become immediate hazards.\nWhen inspecting for lead-based paint hazards, care must be taken to evaluate all types of surfaces, including walls, ceilings, doors and windows, trim and jambs, woodwork, stairway components, porch components, garages, sheds, fences, play equipment, and any other structures on the premises. Because of legal requirements in some areas, it may be necessary to test every surface that may be painted with lead paint (that is, every window, every door, every piece of trim, etc.). Often, however, abatement decisions can be made without this costly and time-consuming approach. Even with an XRF, a full inspection of all surfaces in an average home may take 4 hours or more. Sometimes, extrapolating XRF results to untested surfaces may make sense. Such extrapolation, however, should only be used for positive results. For example, if test results for one window are positive for lead, it is safe to assume that all similar windows are painted with lead-based paint; if test results for one window are negative, it is not safe to assume that no windows have lead- based paint.\nRecent studies have indicated that many children are poisoned by lead-contaminated dust ingested through normal hand-to-mouth activity. This dust can come from lead contaminated soil that is tracked into the home on shoes or from the clothes of a parent who works with lead. However, the most common source of lead dust in the average old house is lead-based paint. Some believe that the level of lead dust in a house can be used as a measure of the severity of the immediate hazard.\nABATEMENT\nProper abatement includes the following steps:\nProper training of all workers involved in the abatement.\nProtecting those workers whenever they are in the abatement area.\nContaining lead-bearing dust and debris.\nReplacing, encapsulating, or removing lead-based paint.\nCleaning the abatement area thoroughly.\nDisposing of abatement debris properly.\nInspecting to make certain the property is ready for reoccupancy.\nAbatement should never be attempted by untrained parents, property owners, or contractors. The property owner's responsibility is not met until all the above steps have been completed.\nPREPARATION: Just prior to abatement, all personal belongings, movable furniture, and drapes should be removed from the abatement area. In homes with deteriorated lead-based paint, furniture may be highly contaminated with lead dust. It is recommended that badly soiled carpets and drapes be discarded because of the difficulty of removing lead from them. Furniture should be cleaned before it is returned to the abated dwelling or it should be replaced. Wood, metal, glass and plastic surfaces should be washed with a high phosphate detergent. If possible, all upholstered furniture, carpets, drapes, and bare surfaces should be vacuumed with a High Efficiency Particle Accumulator (HEPA).\nPRECAUTIONS: Residents and their belongings should remain out of their homes during abatement. Under no circumstances should children and pregnant women be allowed to enter the dwelling unit during the abatement because abatement can generate large quantities of hazardous lead dust.\nTRAINING: All workers involved in a lead abatement project should be properly trained in the following: health effects of lead; proper procedures for worker protection, including procedures for personal hygiene and for wearing and caring for respirators; containment of an abatement project; various methods for abating lead-based paint and the safety and environmental hazards involved with each; and procedures for transporting and disposing of abatement debris properly.\nWORKER PROTECTION: All workers on a lead abatement project and their families must be protected from the hazardous lead dust that will be generated. The minimum acceptable protection would be coveralls (preferably disposable); shoe coverings; hair covering; gloves; goggles; and a properly fitted, negative-pressure, half-mask respirator with a HEPA filter. Other, more protective respirators may be needed to protect from hazards such as organic vapors. If the abatement methods used would generate significant quantities of lead dust or organic vapors, workers must wear more protective respirators, such as supplied air-respirators.\nThe potential hazard to workers of lead dust INGESTION is as significant, if not more significant, than inhalation. Workers must not eat, drink, or smoke on the job; and hands and face must be washed before breaks and at the end of the day. On-sight showers should, if possible, be provided. If on-site showers are not available, workers must shower and wash their hair immediately upon returning home. They must be careful not to carry hazardous levels of lead dust home on their bodies, shoes, or clothing. Therefore, work clothes should not be worn home; either workers should wear protective workclothes instead of street clothes at the worksite or they should wear protective garments over their street clothes. Work clothes should be disposed of or laundered by the employer to prevent the contamination of automobiles, homes, etc. with dust; lead-contaminated clothing should be handled with care and should not be laundered with other clothing of the worker or his family.\nNote: The chapter in the HUD guidelines on worker protection was revised and published separately in the Federal Register on September 28, 1990 (5SFR39873).\nCONTAINMENT: The work area should be contained with plastic (6 mil) to protect other living areas, yards, heating and ventilation systems, etc. from contamination. All nonmovable furnishings, such as counters, cabinets, and radiators should be covered with plastic. All floors should also be covered with plastic to prevent lead dust from being deposited in cracks and crevices and from being ground into the surface during the abatement.\nABATEMENT: Abatement methods fall into three categories:\nreplacement,\npaint removal.\nThese categories are discussed in more detail as follows:\nREPLACEMENT: Removing the building component (such as a window, door, or baseboard) and replacing it with a new one.\nENCAPSULATION: Covering a lead-painted surface with a material that will effectively prevent access to the lead-based paint and that will also prevent lead-bearing dust from that surface from entering the living environment.\nPAINT REMOVAL: Stripping paint by heat, chemical, or mechanical means. This can be done either on-site or at the premises of a chemical stripping firm.\nCertain methods of removing lead-based paint may be particularly hazardous to both the worker and the building occupants and may be banned in some areas. They are:\nRemoving paint with an open-flame torch or other heating device that operates at temperatures likely to volatilize lead (the melting point of lead is 621 degrees Fahrenheit).\nMachine sanding surfaces with lead-based paint.\nSand blasting lead-based paint, except when the equipment is fitted with a vacuum device that prevents the dispersal of the debris.\nUncontained hydro-blasting.\nUsing chemical strippers containing methylene chloride. Methylene chloride is extremely toxic and protecting workers from exposure to this chemical is difficult.\nIf possible, all surfaces painted with lead-based paint should be abated by replacement, encapsulation, or paint removal. Ordinary paint is never an appropriate encapsulant; it is only part of a temporary maintenance procedure. Encapsulation materials should be durable and, where possible, affixed with both fasteners and adhesive. Paintlike coatings should be used with caution. Only coatings and adhesives that are proven to be safe and effective should be used. Any material that will eventually chip, peel, or flake upon aging or from water damage is not appropriate.\nPaint removal is potentially the most hazardous abatement method because considerable amounts of lead dust and lead residue are generated. Paint removal from porous surfaces, such as wood or concrete, ALWAYS leaves significant amounts of lead residue. This residue may not be visible and removing it requires extremely vigorous cleaning procedures (alternating washing with a high phosphate detergent and HEPA vacuuming (see below)). Painting over this residue can lead to lead dust problems when this paint begins to deteriorate or when it is abraded. Of particular concern are friction surfaces, such as window and door jambs.\nWorkers using any method that generates large volumes of dust or fumes should use caution. Such methods increase the difficulty of worker protection and the likelihood that hazardous levels of lead-bearing dust will remain in the dwelling unit or be deposited in the soil surrounding the home. Demolishing older structures with lead-based paint likewise can result in deposition of lead-bearing dust into the soil or on neighboring property, and dust suppression techniques should be used.\nCLEAN-UP: All lead abatement activity is likely to generate quantities of hazardous lead dust. Unless this dust is properly cleaned, the dwelling unit will be more hazardous after abatement than it was before. This dust is difficult to remove. Daily clean- up, consisting of misting debris with water, carefully sweeping it, and placing it in double 4-mil or 6-mil plastic bags, is necessary to minimize the risk to workers of accumulated lead dust.\nAfter abatement and before repainting, all surfaces in the dwelling must be thoroughly vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum; wet washed, preferably with a high phosphate detergent such as trisodium phosphate; and then vacuumed again. The property should be visually inspected before being repainted. The inspector should ascertain that all surfaces covered with lead-based paint have been abated and that no visible dust or debris remains on site.\nSeveral states have adopted a post-abatement dust standard which has been included in the HUD Guidelines. This standard was set mainly on the basis of practicality rather than a health or risk assessment, and further research is needed on the adequacy and appropriateness of that standard. The standard allows the following maximum levels of lead in dust:\nFloors         200 ug per square foot\r\n     Window Sills   500 ug per square foot\r\n     Window Wells   800 ug per square foot\nInspectors and persons collecting dust samples and laboratories measuring dust lead levels should be thoroughly familiar with the recommended sampling and analysis protocols for dust in the HUD Guidelines.\nAfter the inspection, abated surfaces should be repainted, if appropriate. Wooden floors should receive a coat of deck enamel or urethane, concrete floors should be sealed with deck enamel, and linoleum or tile floors should be waxed. Sealing the floors will bind any remaining dust particles and enable the occupants to clean those surfaces easily.\nDISPOSAL: Certain wastes from a lead-based paint abatement project, either liquid or solid, may be classified as hazardous. If so, they will have to be treated as such and handled by a licensed transporter or treatment firm. In any case, all debris from an abatement project, whether classified as hazardous or not, must be contained and transported in such a way as to prevent the dispersal of lead bearing dust, chips, or liquid into the environment. Lead debris should never be sent to a solid waste incinerator, a disposal method that disperses lead into the air.\nREFERENCES\nHUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development).

MANAGEMENT OF LEAD HAZARDS IN THE COMMUNITY\nCOMMUNITY LEVEL INTERVENTION INCLUDES\nRisk assessment and integrated prevention planning.\nOutreach and education.\nInfrastructure development.\nHazard reduction.\nIn theory, primary prevention has always been the goal of childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. In practice, however, most programs focus exclusively on secondary prevention, dealing with children who have already been poisoned. As programs shift the emphasis to primary prevention, their efforts must be designed to systematically identify and remediate environmental sources of lead, including, most importantly, dwellings containing old lead paint.\nThe shift from case management to community-level intervention will require a fundamental shift in perspective. The focus must shift from the individual child to the population of children at risk and the environment in which they live. The purpose of community-level intervention is to identify and respond to sources, not cases, of lead poisoning. The responsibility for addressing lead poisoning will have to be expanded beyond health agencies to include a variety of housing, environmental, and social service agencies at the local, county, state, and national level.\nTO BE SUCCESSFUL, COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTION WILL INVOLVE AT LEAST FIVE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES:\nScreening and surveillance: Determining populations at risk and the locations of the worst exposures.\nRisk assessment and integrated prevention planning: Analyzing all available data to assess sources of lead, exposure patterns, and high-risk populations and developing primary prevention plans.\nOutreach and education: Informing health-care providers, parents, property owners, and other key people about lead poisoning prevention.\nInfrastructure development: Finding the resources needed for a successful program of risk reduction.\nHazard reduction: Reducing the hazards of lead-based paint and lead in dust and soil, particularly in high-risk buildings and neighborhoods.\nSURVEILLANCE\nTO IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST RISKS:\nCollect data on blood lead levels.\nConduct environmental surveys.\nCollect demographic data.\nFor the most effective allocation of resources, data on the extent of the lead poisoning problems and the location of the worst lead hazards must be available for study. By combining data on blood lead levels, environmental sources of lead, and community demographics, public health agencies can identify and quantify the risk of lead poisoning in the community.\nDATA ON BLOOD LEAD LEVELS\nResults of regular blood lead screening for pre-school children (as recommended in Chapter 6 of this report) will eventually provide an important source of information on the distribution of lead hazards in a community. Current data, which are based on limited public screening or the experience of practitioners or clinics, cannot provide the true prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in the children of a community. Communities may need to undertake additional, focused screening surveys to obtain data on the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels. Even after near-universal screening is in place, such targeted screening efforts will continue to be necessary in areas and populations in which substantial numbers of children do not have regular pediatric health-care providers. To be accurate, such surveys should use door-to-door (rather than fixed-site) sampling and blood lead (rather than EP) analysis.\nHealth officials can evaluate risks better if they have the results of all blood lead tests, not just the elevated blood lead levels. A convenient mechanism for gathering such information is for laboratories to report all blood lead testing results to an appropriate local or state health agency. Where mandatory reporting is not in place, health agencies should work with laboratories and pediatric health- care providers to obtain as much data as possible on blood lead test results.\nENVIRONMENTAL SURVEYS\nEnvironmental surveys that are designed to identify the common sources of childhood lead exposure can be undertaken in conjunction with or as a complement to community-based surveys of blood lead levels. Environmental surveys do not, however, replace measurement of children's blood lead levels. The environmental sources and pathways of lead that can be assessed in environmental surveys include lead-based paint, lead in dust and soil, lead in drinking water, lead from industrial sources and wastes, and lead from unusual sources such as folk medicines or ceramicware.\nAn environmental survey of the sources of lead around children's homes (paint, dust, and soil) can be undertaken in conjunction with a door-to-door blood lead screening program. A team would consist of a nurse or phlebotomist who would obtain the blood samples and an inspector who could use the most cost-effective combination of measurements of lead in dust, soil, and paint (for example, XRF analyzers, chemical spot tests, or removal of paint chips for laboratory analysis). When screening for lead-based paint in housing, inspectors should obtain representative data on the prevalence of hazards and need not undertake the type of comprehensive inspections described in Chapter 8. Protocols for environmental sampling must be developed, and inspectors must be trained in sampling techniques before the survey program begins.\nIn addition to looking for lead hazards in housing, a comprehensive environmental lead testing program could look for other lead sources, including drinking water in schools and residential buildings, soil in playgrounds and schoolyards, street dusts, and lead-based paint in nonresidential buildings such as day-care centers and schools. In some cases, environmental data obtained for other purposes may be useful. For example, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and Lead Contamination Control Act requires some testing for lead in drinking water, so health officials could, therefore, contact water suppliers and school officials to obtain test results. Agricultural extension services may have data on lead levels in soil.\nDEMOGRAPHIC DATA\nHealth surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), have correlated children's blood lead levels with demographic factors such as family income and place of residence (for example, center city vs. suburbs). Demographic data now becoming available from the 1990 census can be used to broadly identify high- risk areas. Variables to consider include the age of housing (pre- 1960 housing has the most lead), income levels, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and the number or density of preschool children in the area. For best results, communities would use this demographic information to predict where the greatest lead hazards might be located and then to conduct appropriate blood lead or environmental surveys to see if the predictions are true. Once the most predictive demographic variables have been identified, algorithms or survey instruments could be designed to accurately predict which areas pose the greatest risk on the basis of demographic data alone.\nRISK ASSESSMENT AND INTEGRATED PREVENTION PLANNING\nRisk assessment involves using all available data to evaluate community lead hazards.\nPrimary prevention planning should include representatives from the private and public sectors.\nA primary prevention plan should-include outreach and education programs, infrastructure development, and hazard reduction.\nPublic health officials should use all of the information at their disposal blood lead screening results, environmental survey data, and demographic information to create the most accurate picture of community lead hazards, including sources of lead, exposure patterns, and high-risk populations. Whenever possible, officials should focus on specific sources and the smallest pertinent geographic area of concern. In some new suburban communities, for example, the risks may not justify a communitywide program to abate lead-based paint in housing. Nevertheless, there may be a need to address specific sources (for example, drinking water in new houses with lead solder) or specific neighborhoods (for example, an old part of town where Victorian homes are being rehabilitated).\nBecause lead poisoning is completely preventable, public health officials should assess the success of current prevention efforts. Local communities should focus on how well the hazards of lead are being addressed in that community, rather than on whether the community has a bigger or smaller lead problem than other communities.\nOnce a decision is made to address at least some aspects of the lead problem in a community, public health officials should develop an integrated primary prevention plan. The plan should be assembled with input from other agencies (including housing and environmental agencies), pediatric health-care providers, parents, teachers, community groups, and other interested persons. The plan should identify which sources, geographic areas, or high-risk populations are to be addressed. Each element of the plan should include a description of who will have the primary responsibility for implementation, where financial and other resources will be obtained, and a time schedule for implementation. Plans should be as specific as possible in order to allow public officials and community groups to periodically assess whether and how the plan is being carried out.\nThe remaining sections of this chapter address in more detail three types of activities that should be addressed in any comprehensive primary prevention plan: outreach and education, infrastructure development, and hazard abatement.\nOUTREACH AND EDUCATION\nMUST TAKE PLACE DURING EVERY PHASE OF THE COMMUNITY ACTIVITY.\nSHOULD INVOLVE MANY AGENCIES AND BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS.\nSHOULD INVOLVE MANY PEOPLE IN VARIOUS PROFESSIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REAL ESTATE.\nOutreach and education must take place during every phase of the community activity, beginning before health and environmental screening and ending when risk abatement is complete. Among the most important targets for outreach and educational programs are local officials, health-care providers, parents, property owners, day-care providers, and early childhood educators. The outreach programs can be carried out through pamphlets and other written materials, local news media, public meetings, school programs, and social service agencies.\nLocal health officials who have traditionally carried out all or most lead poisoning prevention activities in a community must begin by reaching out to other agencies that will have a role in communitywide primary prevention efforts. When possible, lead poisoning prevention should be part of an integrated program for creating safe and affordable housing or for providing poor people in the community with the full range of needed social services. Local, state, and federal agencies dealing with health, housing, environmental, and children's issues should be contacted.\nMany health-care providers are unaware of the most recent developments in the field of lead poisoning prevention. Educational campaigns by local officials, licensing agencies, professional associations, clinics, and hospitals are needed to ensure that pediatric health- care providers understand current thinking about the health and environmental aspects of lead poisoning. Outreach through pamphlets, grand rounds, and continuing education programs should be targeted to pediatricians, family practitioners, pediatric and community health nurses, obstetricians, and midwives.\nFor parents, including pregnant women, initial education should focus on the hazards of lead and the need for blood lead testing of children at regular intervals. Parents should know about risk factors that warrant frequent screening (Chapter 6). Educational materials should help parents understand the implications of the screening results. Finally, parents (and parents-to-be) should be informed about simple steps that can be taken to reduce risks, such as proper nutrition (Chapter 4) and housekeeping measures (Chapter 4). Such outreach efforts can be targeted to individual parents and to groups of parents and prospective parents.\nProperty owners and managers, realtors, and other real estate professionals need to learn how to maintain property in a safe and habitable condition. Banks, mortgage companies, and insurance companies could play an important role in conveying this information at critical junctures, such as when a property owner is buying a property or seeking financing for major renovations. In addition, property owners should be given written material that explains how to remove lead safely.\nDay-care providers and early childhood educators should be given information about lead poisoning and its sequelae. Those taking care of young children should also be informed about the need to identify and abate lead hazards in day-care buildings and schools. Parents of lead-poisoned children can aid in this process by informing their child's teachers about the past lead poisoning, so that the teacher can make better informed decisions about the need for remedial measures.\nINFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT\nREGULATIONS AND RULES ON REMOVING LEAD.\nTRAINED INSPECTION AND ABATEMENT CONTRACTORS.\nTEMPORARY HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WHOSE HOMES ARE UNDERGOING ABATEMENT.\nFINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR LEAD POISONING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ABATEMENT.\nBefore a community can launch a broad-based program of preventive deleading and hazard reduction, many elements must be in place to support such activities.\nFirst, regulations or other rules and standards are needed to define when and how inspections and deleading are to occur. One local agency (housing, environmental, or health) should be designated as the lead agency with respect to community intervention activities and a system should be put in place for coordinating regulatory and other activities among all involved agencies.\nA second requirement is contractors who are trained 1) to identify lead hazards, including lead-based paint, and 2) to remove lead-based paint safely. Besides inspectors, abatement planners, contractors, supervisors, and workers are needed. Optimally, such persons should be licensed or certified by a federal or state agency to ensure that their work is of high quality.\nA third infrastructure need is temporary housing for families during the deleading process. Because lead-based paint should not be removed while homes and apartments are occupied, communities must develop strategies to provide temporary alternative housing for families that need it. Communities should consider developing \"safe houses\" where families can live temporarily at little or no cost while their homes are being deleaded. If families are encouraged to \"double up\" with friends, measures should be in place to ensure that the home or apartment being used for temporary housing is free of lead hazards.\nThe final element of infrastructure involves financial resources for both the government agencies overseeing lead poisoning prevention programs and property owners or tenants seeking to delead. This may be the most difficult element, yet it is critical to a successful program. Existing federal and state housing funds (for example, Community Development Block Grants) can be used to finance lead removal if communities so choose. Starting in Fiscal Year 1992, a limited number of loans for abatement may be available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development through the HOME program.\nHAZARD ABATEMENT\nHAZARD ABATEMENT MAY INVOLVE A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES DIRECTED AT MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES AND PATHWAYS.\nABATEMENT RESOURCES SHOULD BE TARGETED TO THE HIGHEST RISK NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOMES.\nTHE GOAL OF HAZARD ABATEMENT IS THE SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION OF LEAD HAZARDS IN THE COMMUNITY.\nThe final and most important step is actually abating the lead hazards. This may involve many activities, such as corrosion control to reduce the amount of lead in drinking water and covering or removing lead- contaminated soil in parks and playgrounds. In many cases, the primary risk will be lead-based paint and the primary form of risk reduction will be preventive deleading -- abatement that occurs before children have been poisoned. Before the hazard abatement phase, the community must decide which lead hazards to target. Information gathered during risk assessment should be used to ensure that abatement resources are directed toward the highest risk neighborhoods and buildings.\nLocal officials have a variety of means at their disposal to promote preventive deleading -- from education and outreach, programs designed to increase voluntary deleading, financial assistance to encourage deleading, and regulatory mechanisms to require deleading. If voluntary efforts are to be encouraged, outreach must go beyond general information to provide building owners with specific information about how to survey a building for lead hazards and how to abate those hazards.\nIf abatement is mandated by law, the law should require safe and effective abatements. Rental property owners should not be permitted to avoid abating their properties by evicting or refusing to rent to families with young children.\nWhatever mechanisms are used, the goal of hazard abatement must be to systematically eradicate the lead hazards in the community. Such a program will protect not only lead-poisoned children but all children and thus safeguard the community's future.\nAPPENDIX I. CAPILLARY SAMPLING PROTOCOL\nMicro specimens of blood collected by finger stick are widely used to measure lead levels, yet there is no consensus on what constitutes the best collection procedure. Published data on collection methods are scant, and much of the data that do exist were published 10 or more years ago, when technology was not as advanced and blood lead levels of concern were significantly higher.\nThe high potential for lead contamination of capillary specimens during collection is well known (CDC, 1985; DeSilva and Donnan, 1980; Mitchell et al., 1974), and the special steps used to minimize the likelihood of contamination constitute the major differences among collection procedures. Special procedures used for minimizing contamination include thorough scrubbing of the hand and finger with soap and then alcohol (Sinclair and Dohnt, 1984; NECCLPP, 1985); using dilute nitric acid (Rosen, 1972; MHD, 1988); or using silicone or a similar barrier spray (Lyngbye et al., 1990; CDHS, 1990; NYSDH, 1989; Mitchell et al., 1974).\nSeveral types of containers for collecting children's blood (maximum volume < or =500 uL) have been introduced in recent years and are widely used by screening programs. The new containers are better than glass tubes, since glass capillary tubes are very fragile. Whether these new containers are suitable for collecting blood for lead measurement has not been extensively studied.\nMore research on these and other issues is clearly needed before the best finger stick collection procedures can be identified. Recognizing these constraints, a finger stick procedure for collecting blood lead specimens follows.\nA. NEEDED MATERIALS\nSoap.\nAlcohol swabs. If a surgical or other disinfectant soap is used, alcohol swabs can be eliminated.\nSterile cotton balls or gauze pads.\nSilicone spray or swabs. The benefits of using a barrier spray, which forms a layer between the skin and blood droplets, have been debated. In addition to doubts about the spray's effectiveness in reducing specimen contamination, the spray makes the collection more expensive and complex. Some evidence exists, however, the spray reduces contamination (NYSDH, 1989; Mitchell et al., 1974), so it is included in this procedure.\nExamination gloves.\nLancets. The type of lancet used is largely a matter of personal preference, so long as sterility is guaranteed.\nCollection containers. If glass capillary tubes are used, sealing clay or tube caps will also be required. No additional supplied are needed for most other micro containers. The laboratory should be consulted to ensure than an appropriate size capillary tube is used.\nAdhesive bandages.\nTrash bags suitable for medical waste and containers for sharps. Bags containing medical waste should be clearly identified as such.\nStorage or mailing containers if needed. If specimens require shipment, follow the Postal Service or other appropriate regulations for shipping body fluids.\nMaterials used in the collection procedure that could contaminate the specimen (for example, blood containers, alcohol swabs, and barrier sprays) must be lead-free. Before selecting equipment for use in blood collection, consult with the laboratory about its requirements. In many cases, the laboratory will recommend or supply suitable collection equipment and may precheck the equipment for lead contamination. Some instrument manufacturers also supply collection materials that are pretested for lead content.\nB. PREPARING FOR BLOOD COLLECTION\nAll personnel who collect specimens should be well-trained in and thoroughly familiar with the collection procedure. The skill of the collector will greatly influence the specimen quality. All equipment should be within easy reach. The environment should be clean, secure, and as nonthreatening to the child as possible. Any necessary consent should be obtained before specimen collection begins, and the procedure should be explained to the child and the parent or guardian. Used materials should be discarded into appropriate waste containers suitable for medical waste immediately following use.\nC. PREPARING THE FINGER FOR PUNCTURE\nNOTE: PUNCTURING OF THE FINGERS OF INFANTS LESS THAN 1 YEAR OF AGE IS NOT RECOMMENDED. PUNCTURING OF THE HEEL IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THESE CHILDREN (NCCLS, 1986).\nCollection personnel should wear examination gloves whenever the potential for contact with blood exists. If the gloves are coated with powder, it should be rinsed off with tap water.\nThe child's hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and then dried with a clean, low lint towel. If water is unavailable, foam soaps can be used without water (D. Griffin, Louisville/Jefferson County Department of Health, personal communication). Plain, unprinted, nonrecycled towels are best (WSLH, 1985). If desired, a brush can be used for cleaning the finger; brushing during washing can increase blood circulation in the finger (CDHS, 1990). Once washed, the finger must not be allowed to come into contact with any surface, including the child's other fingers.\nThe finger to be punctured (often the middle finger) must be free of any visible infection or wound; it should be massaged to increase circulation before being punctured with the lancet. This can be accomplished during or after washing (NYSDH, 1989; CDHS, 1990).\nSTEPS FOR PREPARING THE CHILD'S FINGER\nSelect examination gloves. If necessary, rinse them to remove powder.\nWash the child's hands thoroughly with soap and water, and then dry them with an appropriate towel.\nGrasp the finger that has been selected for puncture between your thumb and index finger with the palm of the child's hand facing up.\nIf not done during washing (see preceding notes), massage the fleshy portion of the finger gently.\nClean the ball or pad of the finger to be punctured with the alcohol swab. Dry the fingertip using the sterile gauze or cotton ball.\nApply the silicone barrier. If a spray is used, shake the can vigorously to mix the contents. Direct the spray away from child and collector. Silicone does not dry, and the finger can be punctured immediately.\nD. PUNCTURING OF THE FINGER AND FORMING DROPS OF BLOOD\nGrasp the finger and quickly puncture it with a sterile lancet in a position slightly lateral of the center of the fingertip.\nWipe off the first droplet of blood with the sterile gauze or cotton ball.\nIf blood flow is inadequate, gently message the proximal portion of the finger and then press firmly on the distal joint of the finger. A well-beaded drop of blood should form at the puncture site.\nDo not let the blood run down the finger or onto the fingernail.\nAfter the finger is ready, the puncture and subsequent steps of forming a drop of blood and filling the collection container should be performed quickly and efficiently, since any delay can make collection more difficult (for example, the blood may clot or the child may resist). Several types of lancets are suitable for puncturing children's fingers. The range from small manual lancet blades to spring-loaded assemblies. Regardless of the lancet used, the puncture should be made swiftly and cleanly and should be deep enough to allow adequate flow.\nThe site of the puncture should be slightly lateral to the ball of the finger. This region is generally less calloused, which makes puncturing easier and, possibly less painful (CDHS, 1990). The first drop of blood contains tissue fluids that will produce inaccurate results; it should be removed with a sterile gauze or cotton ball (NYSDH, 1989; CDHS, 1990).\nA barrier material such as silicone will help a distinct \"bead\" of blood to form, which aids collection. Blood that runs down the finger or around the fingernail is no longer suitable. Blood flows better if the punctured finger is kept lower than the heart. Inadequate blood flow can be improved by gently massaging the proximal portion of the finger in a distal direction, then pressing firmly at the distal joint of the punctured finger (restricting blood flow out of the fingertip) and gently squeezing the sides of the fingertip. Excessive squeezing will cause tissue fluid to be expressed, and the fluid will compromise specimen integrity (NYSDH, 1989; CDHS, 1990). Do not let the blood run down the finger or fingernail.\nE. FILLING THE COLLECTION CONTAINER\nContinuing to grasp the finger, touch the tip of the collection container to the beaded drop of blood.\nDraw the blood into the container maintaining continuous flow of blood.\nWhen full, cap or seal the container as appropriate.\nAgitate the specimen to mix the anticoagulant through the blood.\nCheck that the container is properly labeled, and place it in an appropriate storage area.\nStop the bleeding and cover the finger with an adhesive bandage. Bleeding should stop very quickly. If bleeding is slow to stop, apply pressure to the puncture site with a sterile gauze or a cotton ball. If bleeding continues after 3 to 5 minutes of applying pressure, consult a physician.\nThe proper procedure for filling and capping collection containers is somewhat specific to the container used. As a general rule, contact between the skin and the container is to be avoided. To prevent clotting of the specimen, blood must be mixed with the anticoagulant after filling the container. Depending on the container and anticoagulant used, the agitation needed can range from gentle rocking to vigorous shaking. Some procedures call for the collection container to be rotated during filling so that anticoagulant will be distributed quickly through the sample (MDPH, 1990).\nTo facilitate blood flow, many procedures call for the collection container be held nearly horizontal, with a slight downward angle. Blood flow into the container should be uninterrupted to avoid air bubbles in the specimen. Except for glass capillary tubes, containers come with appropriate caps, and these should be applied immediately following collection. Specimens in glass capillary tubes are often collected in duplicate and then sealed with rubber caps or plasticine sealing clay or both. Again, consulting with the laboratory and knowing the manufacturer's recommendations are important to ensure specimen integrity and suitability for analysis.\nREFERENCES\nCDHS (California Department of Health Services).

SUMMARY FOR THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER\nTHE FOLLOWING MATERIAL SUMMARIZES THOSE PARTS OF THE LEAD STATEMENT THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE SOME OF THE CRITICAL INFORMATION ON SUCH TOPICS AS PRIMARY PREVENTION, SOURCES OF LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AND ABATEMENT. MORE INFORMATION ON ALL OF THE TOPICS DESCRIBED HEREIN IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPLETE STATEMENT.\nCHAPTERS 1 AND 2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\nChildhood lead poisoning is one of the most common pediatric health problems in the United States today, and it is entirely preventable. Enough is now known about the sources and pathways of lead exposure and about ways of preventing this exposure to begin the efforts to permanently eradicate this disease. The persistence of lead poisoning in the United States, in light of all that is known, presents a singular and direct challenge to public health authorities, clinicians, regulatory agencies, and society.\nPrevious lead statements issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have acknowledged the adverse effects of lead at lower and lower levels. In the most recent previous CDC lead statement, published in 1985, the threshold for action was set at a blood lead level of 25 ug/dL, although it was acknowledged that adverse effects occur below that level. In the past several years, however, the scientific evidence showing that some adverse effects occur at blood lead levels at least as low as 10 ug/dL in children has become so overwhelming and compelling that it must be a major force in determining how we approach childhood lead exposure.\nBecause 10 ug/dL is the lower level of the range at which effects are now identified, primary prevention activities -- communitywide environmental interventions and nutritional and educational campaigns should be directed at reducing children's blood lead levels at least to below 10 ug/dL. Blood lead levels between 10 and 14 ug/dL are in a border zone. While the overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 ug/dL, there are several reasons for not attempting to do interventions directed at individual children to lower blood lead levels of 10-14 ug/dL. First, laboratory measurements of blood lead levels may be variable, so a blood lead level in this range may, in fact, be below 10 ug/dL. Secondly, effective environmental and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated. Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from the individualized followup required by children who have higher blood lead levels.\nTHE SINGLE, ALL-PURPOSE DEFINITION OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A MULTITIER APPROACH. Community prevention activities should be triggered by blood lead levels > or = 10 ug/dL. Medical evaluation and environmental investigation and remediation should be done for all children with blood lead levels > or = 20 ug/dL. All children with blood lead levels > or = 15 ug/dL require individual followup, including nutritional and educational interventions. Furthermore, depending on the availability of resources environmental investigation and remediation should be done for children with blood lead levels of 15-19 ,ug/dL, if such levels persist. The highest priority should continue to be the children with the highest blood lead levels.\nOther differences between the 1985 and 1991 statements are as follows:\nSCREENING TEST OF CHOICE. Because the erythrocyte protoporphyrin level is not sensitive enough to identify children with elevated blood lead levels below about 25 ug/dL, the screening test of choice is now blood lead measurement.\nUNIVERSAL SCREENING. Since virtually all children are at risk for lead poisoning, a phase in of universal screening is recommended, except in communities where large numbers or percentages of children have been screened and found not to have lead poisoning. The full implementation of this will require the ability to measure blood lead levels on capillary samples and the availability of cheaper and easier-to-use methods of blood lead measurement.\nPRIMARY PREVENTION. Efforts need to be increasingly focused on preventing lead poisoning before it occurs. This will require communitywide environmental interventions, as well as educational and nutritional campaigns.\nSUCCIMER. In January, 1991, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved succimer, an oral chelating agent, for chelation of children with blood lead levels over 45 ug/dL.\nCHAPTER 3. SOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF LEAD EXPOSURE\nA child's environment is full of lead. Children are exposed to lead from different sources (such as paint, gasoline, and solder) and through different pathways (such as air, food, water, dust, and soil). Although all U.S. children are exposed to some lead from food, air, dust, and soil, some children are exposed to high dose sources of lead. Lead-based paint is the most widespread and dangerous high- dose source of lead exposure for preschool children.\nLead-based paint (containing up to 50% lead) was in widespread use through the 1940s. Although the use and manufacture of interior lead- based paint declined during the 1950s and thereafter, exterior lead- based paint and lesser amounts of interior lead-based paint continued to be available until the mid-1970s. (Lead-based paint produced after the 1940s tended to have much lower lead concentrations than lead- based paint produced earlier.)\nPica, the repeated ingestion of nonfood substances, has been implicated in cases of lead poisoning; however, a child does not have to eat paint chips to become poisoned. More commonly, children ingest dust and soil contaminated with lead from paint which flaked or chalked as it aged or which has been disturbed during home maintenance and renovation. This lead-contaminated house dust, ingested via normal repetitive hand-to-mouth activity, is now recognized as a major contributor to the total body burden of lead in children. Because of the critical role of dust as an exposure pathway, children living in sub-standard housing and in homes undergoing renovation are at particular risk for lead poisoning.\nMany cases of childhood lead poisoning that result from renovation or remodeling of homes have been reported. Before older homes undergo any renovation that may generate dust, they should be tested for the presence of lead-based paint. If such paint is found, contractors experienced in working with lead-based paint should do the renovations.\nOther potentially important sources and pathways of lead exposure include soil and dust, water, \"take home\" exposures from parental occupations and hobbies, water, and food. Very high-dose exposure may occasionally result from sources other than lead-based paint in specific situations.\nCHAPTER 4. THE ROLE OF THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER\nPediatric health-care providers, working as part of the public health team, must play a critical role in the prevention and management of childhood lead poisoning. Their roles include: 1) educating parents about key causes of childhood lead poisoning; 2) screening children and interpreting blood lead test results; 3) working with appropriate groups in the public and private sectors to make sure that poisoned children receive appropriate medical, environmental, and social service followup; and 4) coordinating with public health officials and others involved in lead-poisoning prevention activities.\nAlong with educating parents about nutrition and developmental stages, providers should discuss the potential hazards of lead. They should focus on the major likely preventable sources of high-dose lead poisoning in their communities. Parents should be told of the potential dangers of peeling lead-based paint, the potential hazards of renovating older homes, and the need for good work practices if their occupations or hobbies expose them to lead. In some communities parents should be warned about the potential for lead exposure from improperly fired ceramicware and imported pottery. In others, where water lead levels are a concern, parents could be advised to use only fully-flushed water (that is, water that has not been standing in pipes for a prolonged time) from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing infant formula.\nPediatric health-care providers should provide information about simple ways parents can reduce exposure to lead. Some examples of these are discussed below.\nHOUSEKEEPING INTERVENTIONS. Particularly in older homes, which may have been painted with lead-based paint, interventions to reduce exposure to dust may help reduce blood lead levels. These include:\nMake sure your child does not have access to peeling paint. Pay special attention to windows and window sills and wells.\nIf the house was built before about 1960 and has hard surface floors, wet mop them at least once a week with a high phosphate solution (for example, 6-8% phosphates). (The phosphate content of automatic dishwashing detergents and other cleaning substances is often listed on the label and may be high enough for this purpose. Otherwise, trisodium phosphate can be purchased in hardware stores.) Other hard surfaces (such as window sills and baseboards) should also be wiped with a similar solution. Do not vacuum hard surface floors or window sills or wells, since this will disperse dust. Vacuum cleaners with agitators remove dust from rugs more effectively than vacuum cleaners with suction only.\nWash your child's hands and face before he/she eats.\nWash toys and pacifiers frequently.\nOTHER INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO LEAD.\nIf soil around the home is or is likely to be contaminated with lead (for example, if the home was built before 1960 or the house is near a major highway), plant grass or other ground cover. Since the highest concentrations of lead in a yard tend to be near surfaces that were once painted with lead paint, like exterior walls, if exterior lead paint was likely to be used, plant bushes around the outside of your house so your child cannot play there.\nIn areas where the lead content of water exceeds the drinking water standard, use only fully-flushed water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and making formula. In communities where water conservation is a concern, use first-flush water for other purposes.\nDo not store food in open cans, particularly if the cans are imported.\nDo not use pottery or ceramicware that was improperly fired or is meant for decorative use for food storage or service.\nMake sure that take-home exposures are not occurring from parental occupations or hobbies (Chapter 3).\nNot all aspects of a poisoned child's followup will be managed by the pediatric health-care provider, although the provider is an important part of the team. Through his or her interactions with the child and family and the responsible public health agency, the provider should make sure that any appropriate interventions are occurring. If the child needs a medical evaluation (for a blood lead level > or = 20 ug/dL) or pharmacologic treatment (Chapter 7), either the provider should do it or should refer the child to a place that treats large numbers of poisoned children. The provider should make sure that the child receives an appropriate environmental investigation and remediation with the help of the public health agencies. Particularly if the child is developmentally delayed, the provider should refer the child to an appropriate infant stimulation or child development program. In many cases, lead-poisoned children and their families will also benefit from social services followup.\nCHAPTER 5. THE ROLE OF STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES\nA variety of local, state and federal agencies play a role in preventing childhood lead poisoning. Pediatric health care providers and parents should know about what these agencies do so that they can use these resources effectively. In turn, these agencies must coordinate their activities to ensure that all aspects of childhood lead poisoning prevention -- health, housing, and environment -- are being addressed, and to provide the most comprehensive and cost-effective services to at-risk children, their parents, and their health-care providers.\nCHAPTER 6. SCREENING\nTraditionally, the main purpose of a childhood lead poisoning screening program has been to identify asymptomatic lead-poisoned children and to intervene as quickly as possible to reduce their blood lead levels. An additional benefit of screening programs is that abatement of lead sources for poisoned children results in prevention of lead poisoning for children who would have been exposed to those sources in the future. As the focus in lead poisoning prevention turns more to primary prevention, an additional benefit of screening is that data generated can be used in targeting interventions to places with children at high risk for lead poisoning.\nIn 1984, the last year for which estimates are available, it is believed that between 3 and 4 million children younger than age 6 years (17% of all U.S. children in this age group) had blood lead levels above 15 ug/dL. Furthermore, about 74% of occupied, privately owned housing built before 1980 contains lead-based paint (defined as > or = 1 mg/square cm). BECAUSE ALMOST ALL U.S. CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR LEAD POISONING (ALTHOUGH SOME CHILDREN ARE AT HIGHER RISK THAN OTHERS), OUR GOAL IS THAT ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE SCREENED, UNLESS IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THESE CHILDREN LIVE DOES NOT HAVE A CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PROBLEM. (Deciding that no problem exists requires that a large number or percentage of children be tested.) The full implementation of this will require the ability to measure blood lead levels on capillary samples and the availability of cheaper and easier-to-use methods of blood lead measurement. Children at highest risk for lead poisoning are the highest priority for screening. Table 6 1 provides guidance on the groups for which repeated screening is most strongly indicated.\nChildren ages 6 to 72 months who live in or are frequent visitors to deteriorated old buildings, including day care centers, make up the highest priority group. Because the highest concentrations of lead in paint were used in the early 1900s, homes built before about 1960 are of greatest concern. Children whose homes are being renovated are also at extremely high risk. Since siblings, house mates, visitors, and playmates of children with confirmed lead poisoning may have similar exposures to lead, they also should be promptly screened. In communities with a high prevalence of lead poisoning, health departments should consider door-to-door screening, since many children with lead poisoning may be missed by fixed-site screening.\nChildren with parents whose work or hobbies involve lead may also risk lead exposure (Chapter 3). Also, children living near lead smelters or other industries where lead is processed may be at increased risk for lead poisoning.\nIn general, screening and assessment for lead poisoning should focus on children younger than 72 months of age, particularly on children younger than 36 months of age. Young children engage in the most hand-to-mouth activity (and therefore are at highest risk for lead exposure) and have the most rapidly developing nervous systems, making them more vulnerable to the effects of lead. Children with developmental delays, who may exhibit pica or have more extensive hand-to-mouth activity than other children, would be expected to be at increased risk for lead poisoning even if they are 72 months of age and older. These children may have to be screened more often during early infancy, and may require screening into their school years.\nChildren who have unexplained seizures, neurological symptoms, abdominal pain, or other symptoms that are consistent with lead poisoning should also have their blood lead levels measured. In addition, the possibility of lead poisoning should be considered in any child with growth failure, developmental delay, hyperactivity, behavior disorders, hearing loss, anemia, etc.\nSCREENING METHOD\nSince erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) is not sensitive enough to identify more than a small percentage of children with blood lead levels between 10 and 25 ug/dL and misses many children with blood lead levels > or = 25 ug/dL, measurement of blood lead levels should replace the EP test as the primary screening method. Unless contamination of capillary blood samples can be prevented, lead levels should be measured on venous samples. Obtaining capillary specimens is more feasible at many screening sites. Contamination of capillary specimens obtained by finger prick can be minimized if trained personnel follow proper technique. Elevated blood lead results obtained on capillary specimens should be considered presumptive and must be confirmed using venous blood. At the present time, not all laboratories will measure lead levels on capillary specimens.\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE AND ASSESSING RISK\nGuidance on childhood lead poisoning prevention and assessment of the risk of lead poisoning should be part of routine pediatric care. Anticipatory guidance is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. The guidance and risk assessment should emphasize the sources and exposures that are of greatest concern in the child's community (Chapter 3). Because lead-based paint has been used in housing throughout the United States, in most communities it will be necessary to focus on this source.\nTable 6 2 has sample questions for assessing a child's risk for high- dose lead exposure. Starting at 6 months of age and at each regular office visit thereafter, pediatric health-care providers should discuss childhood lead poisoning and assess the child's risk for high-dose exposure. The questions asked should be tailored to the likely sources of exposure in the community. THE QUESTIONS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nOn the basis of responses to questions such as those in Table 6 2 , children can be categorized as low or high risk for high-dose lead exposure. If the answers to all questions are negative, the child is at low risk for high-dose lead exposure and should be screened by a blood lead test at 12 months and again, if possible, at 24 months (since blood lead levels often peak at ages greater than 12 months). If the answer to any question is positive, the child is potentially at high risk for high-dose lead exposure, and a blood lead test should be obtained. FOR CHILDREN PREVIOUSLY AT LOW RISK, ANY HISTORY SUGGESTING THAT EXPOSURE TO LEAD HAS INCREASED SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UP WITH A BLOOD LEAD TEST.\nSCREENING SCHEDULE\nThe following sections provide a minimum screening schedule for children aged 6 up to 36 and 36 to 72 months. The schedule is not rigid. Rather, it is a guide for pediatric health-care providers and screening programs to use in conjunction with other pertinent information in determining when an individual child should be tested. Programs and pediatric health-care providers may choose to screen more frequently than described below.\nCHILDREN 6 UP TO 36 MONTHS OF AGE:\nA questionnaire should be used at each routine office visit to assess the potential for high-dose lead exposure and, therefore, the appropriate frequency of screening.\nSCHEDULE IF THE CHILD IS AT LOW RISK FOR HIGH DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE BY QUESTIONNAIRE:\nA child at LOW RISK for exposure to high-dose lead sources by questionnaire should have an initial blood lead test at 12 months of age.\nIf the 12-month blood lead result is < 10 UG/DL, the child should be retested at 24 months if possible, since that is when blood lead levels peak.\nIf a blood lead test result is 10-14 UG/DL, the child should be retested every 3 to 4 months. After 2 consecutive measurements are < 10 ug/dL or three are < 15 ug/dL, the child should be retested in a year.\nIf any blood lead test result is > 15 UG/DL, the child needs individual case management and should be retested at least every 3 to 4 months.\nSCHEDULE IF THE CHILD IS AT HIGH RISK FOR HIGH DOSE LEAD EXPOSURE BY QUESTIONNAIRE:\nA child at HIGH RISK for exposure to high-dose lead sources by questionnaire should have an initial blood lead test at 6 months of age.\nIf the initial blood lead result is < 10 UG/DL, the child should be rescreened every 6 months. After 2 subsequent consecutive measurements are < 10 ug/dL or three are < 15 ug/dL, testing frequency can be decreased to once a year.\nIf a blood lead test result is 10-14 UG/DL, the child should be screened every 3 to 4 months. Once 2 subsequent consecutive measurements are < 10 ug/dL or three are < 15 ,ug/dL, testing frequency can be decreased to once a year.\nIf any blood lead test result is > OR = 15 ,UG/DL, the child needs individual case management and should be retested at least every 3 to 4 months.\nCHILDREN > OR = 36 MONTHS AND < 72 MONTHS OF AGE:\nAs for younger children, a questionnaire should be used at each routine office visit of children from 36 to 72 months of age. Any child at high risk by questionnaire who has not previously had a blood lead test should be tested. All children who have had venous blood lead tests > or = 15 ug/dL or who are at high risk by questionnaire should be screened at least once a year until their sixth birthday (age 72 months) or later, if indicated (for example, a retarded child with pica). Children should also be rescreened any time history suggests exposure has increased. Children with blood lead levels > or = 15 ug/dL should receive followup as described below.\nFOLLOWUP OF CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 15 UG/DL\nFollowup of children with blood lead levels > or = 15 ug/dL is discussed in more detail in later chapters and is briefly summarized below. In general, such children should receive blood lead tests at least every 3 to 4 months.\nIF THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL IS 16-19 UG/DL, the child should be screened every 3-4 months, the family should be given education and nutritional counseling as described in Chapter 4, and a detailed environmental history should be taken to identify any obvious sources or pathways of lead exposure. When the venous blood lead level is in this range in two consecutive tests 3-4 months apart, environmental investigation and abatement should be conducted, if resources permit.\nIF THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL IS > OR = 20 UG/DL, the child should be given a repeat test for confirmation. If the venous blood lead level is confirmed to be > or = 20 ug/dL, the child should be referred for medical evaluation and followup as described in Chapter 7. Such children should continue to receive blood lead tests every 3-4 months or more often if indicated. Children with blood lead levels > or = 45 ug/dL must receive urgent medical and environmental followup, preferably at a clinic with a staff experienced in dealing with this disease. Symptomatic lead poisoning or a venous blood lead concentration > or = 70 ug/dL is a medical emergency, requiring immediate inpatient chelation therapy, as described in Chapter 7.\nCLASSIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF SCREENING TEST RESULTS\nOn the basis of screening test results, children can be classified into categories according to their risk for adverse effects of lead. The urgency and type of followup are based on these risk classes. These classes are shown in Table 6 3 .\nMEASUREMENT OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS\nSeveral factors can influence the quality of blood lead measurements. The ubiquity of lead in the environment makes contamination of specimens during collection a major source of error. Analytical variation in the laboratory can affect results. Accuracy and precision of blood lead measurements, particularly at low concentrations, can be assured by the use of appropriate analytical standards, maintenance of equipment, training of personnel, and participation in external proficiency testing programs.\nSince blood collected by venipuncture has a low likelihood of contamination compared to blood collected by finger stick, venous blood is the preferred specimen for analysis and should be used for lead measurement whenever practicable. In addition, venous specimens provide a larger volume for analysis and are less prone to clotting and other problems that can be encountered with capillary specimens. At the present time, not all laboratories will accept capillary samples for lead analysis.\nFinger stick specimens are acceptable for blood lead screening, provided that special collection procedures are followed to minimize the risk of contamination. Personnel must be thoroughly trained in collection procedures. A procedure for collecting finger stick specimens is described in Appendix I.\nElevated blood lead results obtained on capillary specimens are presumptive and must be confirmed using venous blood. In general, children who have blood lead levels > or = 15 ug/dL on capillary samples should have these levels confirmed on venous samples, according to the timetable in Table 6 4 . A child with a blood lead level > or = 70 ug/dL or with symptoms of lead poisoning should be treated immediately while the results of an immediate confirmatory test are awaited.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVELS -- ADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nBlood lead levels can be determined by several analytic methods. The method used can affect the specimen volume required, the choice of anticoagulant (usually heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and other aspects related to specimen suitability. Specimen collection procedures and equipment must be checked for compatibility with laboratory requirements. Special lead-free evacuated tubes are available for blood collection, but standard tubes containing EDTA or heparin (lavender or green caps) can be acceptable after screening each lot to determine the lead content of the containers, needles, etc. Though reports of unsuitable levels of background lead in other collection materials are infrequent, all materials used should be determined to be lead-free before use.\nLaboratories where blood is tested for lead levels should be successful participants in a blood lead proficiency testing program, such as the program conducted jointly by CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the University of Wisconsin. In interpreting laboratory results, it should be recognized that a \"proficient\" laboratory need only measure blood lead levels to within several ug/dL of the true value (for example, within 4 or 6 ug/dL of a target value). The blood lead level reported by a laboratory, therefore, may be several ug/dL higher or lower than the actual blood lead level.\nERYTHROCYTE PROTOPORPHYRIN (EP)\nEP is not a sensitive test to identify children with blood lead levels below about 25 u/dL, and therefore it is no longer the screening test of choice. In some programs, however, it will continue to be used until the transition to blood lead measurements is complete.\nOnly fresh blood is suitable for analysis by hematofluorometer. Complete oxygenation of sample hemoglobin is necessary to prevent low results in some instruments. The hemoglobin concentration in the sample can also affect hematofluorometer EP readings. Results obtained by extraction methods are not affected by these factors and can be used to confirm hematofluorometer EP results.\nIn the past, an absorptivity of 241 L cm-1 mmol-1 has been used to determine EP levels. Recently, however, the correct absorptivity has been determined to be 297 L cm-1 mmol-l. Use of the correct absorptivity will result in EP values about 19% lower than those standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1. Standardization of EP levels that are based on the correct absorptivity is expected to be widely adopted in 1992. Use of the correct standardization requires a change in calibration and is not simply a reduction of the screening cutoff value. Standardization criteria should also be considered when reviewing data in the literature.\nAn EP result of > or = 35 ug/dL standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1 or > or = 28 ug/dL standardized using 297 L cm-1 mmol-1 is considered elevated. ALL ELEVATED EP RESULTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH A VENOUS BLOOD LEAD TEST TO DETERMINE IF LEAD POISONING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ELEVATION. Elevated concentrations of EP also result from several health conditions other than lead intoxication, particularly iron deficiency. The iron status of children with elevated EP levels should always be determined, especially since iron deficiency and lead poisoning often coexist. In such cases, the EP may be disproportionately elevated in comparison to the blood lead level.\nSome hematofluorometers report EP levels as umol ZnPP/mol heme. For instruments that give results in these units, EP values > or = 70 umol/mol should be considered elevated and should be promptly investigated.\nCHAPTER 7. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL\nChildren with blood lead levels between 10 Ug/dL and 19 ug/dL and their siblings need followup and repeat screening as described in previous chapters. They do not, however, need medical evaluation as described in this chapter.\nThe cornerstones of clinical management are careful clinical and laboratory surveillance of the child, medical treatment when indicated, and eradication of controllable sources of environmental lead. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CASE MANAGEMENT IS TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD.\nAll children with confirmed venous blood lead levels > or = 20 ug/dL require medical evaluation. The urgency of further medical evaluation depends on the blood lead level and whether symptoms are present.\nThe decision to institute medical management should virtually always be made on the basis of a venous blood lead measurement. No other screening test can be considered diagnostic. If the first evaluation was made on capillary blood, a confirmatory venous blood lead level must be done. Even if the first diagnostic measurement was on venous blood, it is preferable to retest before starting chelation therapy. For children with blood lead levels > or = 70 ug/dL or clinical symptoms of lead poisoning, chelation should not be postponed while awaiting results of the repeat test.\nSYMPTOMS OF LEAD POISONING\nSYMPTOMS OF LEAD POISONING IN A CHILD WITH AN ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL CONSTITUTE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, AND THE CHILD SHOULD BE HOSPITALIZED. Symptoms, which can mimic several other pediatric disorders, must be looked for so they are not missed.\nAcute lead encephalopathy is characterized by some or all of these symptoms: coma, seizures, bizarre behavior, ataxia, apathy, incoordination, vomiting, alteration in the state of consciousness, and subtle loss of recently acquired skills. Any one or a mixture of these symptoms, associated with an elevated blood lead level, is an acute medical emergency. Lead encephalopathy is almost always associated with a blood lead level exceeding 100 ug/dL, although, occasionally, it has been reported at blood lead levels as low as 70 ,ug/dL. Even when identified and promptly treated, severe and permanent brain damage may result in 70%-80% of children with lead encephalopathy. Children with symptomatic lead poisoning with or without encephalopathy represent an acute medical emergency. THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAD ENCEPHALOPATHY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHILDREN PRESENTING WITH COMA AND CONVULSIONS OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY.\nExcept for coma and seizures, symptomatic lead poisoning without encephalopathy is characterized by symptoms similar to those of lead encephalopathy. Symptomatic lead poisoning without encephalopathy is characterized by one or a combination of these symptoms: decrease in play activity, lethargy, anorexia, sporadic vomiting, intermittent abdominal pain, and constipation. These symptoms are usually associated with a blood lead levels of at least 70 ug/dL, although occasionally cases have been associated with levels as low as 50 ug/dL. If the blood lead level is below 50 ,ug/dL, other causes of the symptoms should be sought. SINCE ACUTE LEAD ENCEPHALOPATHY MAY DEVELOP IN ANY SYMPTOMATIC CHILD, TREATMENT AND SUPPORTIVE MEASURES MUST BE STARTED IMMEDIATELY ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS.\nEVALUATION OF THE CHILD WITH A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL > OR = 20 UG/DL\nA child with a blood lead level > or = 20 ug/dL should have a pediatric evaluation, whether or not symptoms are present.\nSPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO:\nA detailed history, including the presence or absence of clinical symptoms, child's mouthing activities, the existence of pica, nutritional status (especially iron and calcium intake), dietary habits, family history of lead poisoning, potential sources of lead exposure (including exposure due to home renovation), and previous blood lead measurements.\nDetailed environmental and occupational histories of adults in the household or other places the child spends a lot of time.\nThe physical examination, with particular attention to the neurologic examination and psychosocial and language development. A neurobehavioral assessment may be useful in children receiving chelation therapy both at the time of diagnosis and as the child approaches school age. Findings of language delay or other problems can prompt referral to appropriate programs.\nEvaluation of iron status using measurement of iron and total iron binding capacity or of ferritin.\nTESTS\nTESTS FOR IRON DEFICIENCY. BECAUSE IRON DEFICIENCY CAN ENHANCE LEAD ABSORPTION AND TOXICITY AND OFTEN COEXISTS WITH IT, ALL CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL SHOULD BE TESTED FOR IRON DEFICIENCY. Measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte are not adequately sensitive, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) is not specific enough to diagnose iron deficiency (although EP can be used to screen for iron deficiency).\nSERUM IRON AND IRON BINDING CAPACITY (TRANSFERRIN SATURATION) AND FERRITIN are the most sensitive indicators of iron status. An abnormally low ratio of serum iron to iron binding capacity (transferrin saturation) of 0.2 is consistent with iron deficiency. The serum ferritin level, however, is the most definitive and accurate indication of overall iron status, although it is an acute phase reactant and may be falsely elevated in sick children; a value > or = 12 ,ug/dL indicates iron deficiency. Although all iron deficient children should receive treatment for this condition, the treatment should not be started until after chelation is completed in children receiving dimercaprol (BAL).\nEP LEVEL. An elevated EP level indicates impairment of the heme biosynthetic pathway. EP levels are sensitive screening tests for iron deficiency, and iron status should be assessed in any child with an elevated EP level (that is, > or = 35 ug/dL when standardized using 241 L cm-1 mmol-1, > or = 28 ug/dL when standardized using 297 L cm-1 mmol-1, or > or = 70 ,umol/mol when measured in umol/mol units).\nBecause EP levels take about 2 weeks to increase, EP levels may provide an indication of the duration of lead exposure. Similarly, monitoring the EP level after medical and environmental interventions for poisoned children may be useful. If exposure to lead has ceased, EP values elevated because of lead poisoning decline slowly over several weeks or months. A progressive decline in EP concentrations indicates that combined medical and environmental case management is proceeding efficaciously.\nEDETATE DISODIUM CALCIUM (CANA2EDTA) PROVOCATIVE CHELATION TEST. The mobilization test is used to determine whether a child with an initial confirmatory blood lead level of 25 to 44 ug/dL will respond to chelation therapy with a brisk lead diuresis. Because of the cost and staff time needed for quantitative urine collection, this test is used only in selected medical centers where large numbers of lead- poisoned children are treated. Children whose blood lead levels are > or = 45 ug/dL should not receive a provocative chelation test; they should be referred for appropriate chelation therapy immediately.\nThe outcome of the provocative chelation test is determined not by a decrease in the blood lead level but by the amount of lead excreted per dose of CaNa2EDTA given. This ratio correlates well with blood lead levels. In one study, almost all children with blood lead levels 45 ug/dL had positive provocative tests, 76% of the children with blood lead levels 35 to 44 ug/dL had positive test results, and 35% of the children with blood lead levels 25 to 34 ug/dL had positive test results. This test should not be done until the child is iron replete, since iron status may affect the outcome of the test. Details on how to conduct and interpret a provocative chelation test are in Chapter 7.\nRADIOLOGIC EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN. Radiologic examination of the abdomen (flat plate) may show radiopaque foreign material if the material has been ingested during the preceding 24 to 36 hours. Neither negative nor positive x-ray results are diagnostic or definitive. A flat plate of the abdomen may, however, provide information about the source of lead if paint chips or other lead objects are found.\nRADIOLOGIC EXAMINATION OF THE LONG BONES. X-rays of the long bones are unreliable for diagnosing acute lead poisoning, and they should not be obtained on a routine basis. They may provide some indication of whether lead poisoning has occurred in the past or has been ongoing for a length of time, and this may occasionally be important. Lines of increased density in the metaphyseal plate of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula may be caused by lead which has disrupted the metabolism of bone matrix. Although these lines are sometimes called lead lines, they are areas of increased mineralization or calcification and not x-ray shadows of deposited lead.\nThe following tests are NOT indicated for the diagnosis or clinical management of lead poisoning:\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF RED CELLS FOR BASOPHILIC STIPPLING. Since basophilic stippling is not always found in severe lead poisoning and is insensitive to lesser degrees of lead poisoning, it is not useful in diagnosis.\nTests of hair and fingernails for lead levels. The levels of lead in hair or fingernails do not correlate well with blood lead levels, except in extreme cases of symptomatic lead poisoning; therefore, these tests are not useful in diagnosis. Children should never receive chelating agents on the basis of analyses of lead levels in hair or fingernails.\nPHARMACOLOGY OF CHELATING AGENTS\nSeveral drugs are used in the treatment of lead poisoning. These drugs, capable of binding or chelating lead, deplete the soft and hard (skeletal) tissues of lead and thus reduce its acute toxicity. All drugs have potential side effects and must be used with caution. The basic pharmacologic characteristics of the various drugs are described below.\nTable 7 1\nBAL\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. Two molecules of dimercaprol (BAL) combine with one atom of heavy metal to form a stable complex. BAL enhances fecal and urinary excretion of lead and diffuses well into erythrocytes. Because it is predominantly excreted in bile, BAL can be administered in the presence of renal impairment.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. BAL is available only in peanut oil for intramuscular administration. It is usually given every 4 hours, although it may be given every 8 hours; dosages are discussed below.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. For patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD), some clinicians recommend that BAL should be used only in life-threatening situations because it may induce hemolysis. Medicinal iron should never be administered during BAL therapy, because the combination of iron and BAL has been implicated in serious reactions. If iron deficiency coexists, it should not be treated until after BAL therapy has been completed. In cases of extreme anemia, blood transfusions are preferable.\nBetween 30% and 50% of patients who receive BAL will experience side effects. Mild febrile reactions and transient elevations of hepatic transaminases may be observed. Other minor adverse effects include, in order of frequency, nausea and occasional vomiting, headache, mild conjunctivitis, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and salivation. Most side effects are transient and rapidly subside as the drug is metabolized and excreted. Intravenous hydration coupled with restricting oral intake can circumvent, in large part, gastrointestinal distress. BAL SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS OR PEANUT PRODUCTS.\nCaNA2EDTA\nONLY CaNa2EDTA CAN BE USED FOR TREATING CHILDREN WITH LEAD POISONING. Na2EDTA (DISODIUM EDETATE) SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR TREATING CHILDREN WITH LEAD POISONING BECAUSE IT WILL INDUCE TETANY AND POSSIBLY FATAL HYPOCALCEMIA.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. CaNa2EDTA increases urinary lead excretion twentyfold to fiftyfold. CaNa2EDTA removes lead from the extracellular compartment only, because it does not enter cells.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. The preferred route for administration of CaNa2EDTA is intravenous. CaNa2EDTA must be diluted to a concentration < 0.5% in dextrose and water or in 0.9% saline solution. It can be given as a continuous infusion or it can be given in two divided doses a day through a heparin lock over 30 to 60 minutes. CaNa2EDTA causes extreme pain when administered intramuscularly; therefore, when given by this route, it should be mixed with procaine so that the final concentration of procaine is 0.5%. CaNa2EDTA should never be given orally because it enhances absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract.\nDosages vary by situation and are detailed in Chapter 7. Individual courses should be limited to 5 days and repeated courses should be given at a minimum of 2- to 5-day intervals. Particularly when CaNa2EDTA is given on an outpatient basis, some clinicians use sequential 3-day courses of treatment.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. During chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA, urine output, urine sediment, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and hepatocellular enzyme levels must be carefully monitored. The appearance of protein and formed elements in urinary sediment, and rising BUN and serum creatinine values reflect impending renal failure the serious toxicity associated with inappropriately excessive or prolonged administration of CaNa2EDTA. Liver transanimases may increase by the fifth day of therapy, but return to pretreatment levels within a week after treatment has ended.\nWhen CaNa2EDTA is used alone without concomitant BAL therapy, it may aggravate symptoms in patients with very high blood lead levels. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with BAL when the blood lead level is > or = 70 ug/dL or overt clinical symptoms of lead poisoning are present. In such cases, the first dose of BAL should always precede the first dose of CaNa2EDTA by at least 4 hours.\nThe kidney is the principal site of potential toxicity. Renal toxicity is dose related, reversible, and rarely (if ever) occurs at doses < 1500 mg/square m when the patient is adequately hydrated. CaNa2EDTA must never be given in the absence of an adequate urine flow.\nD-PENICILLAMINE\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved D-penicillamine for the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and severe, active rheumatoid arthritis. Although not approved for this use, it is used in some centers for treating lead poisoning. Until the recent approval of succimer, it was the only commercially available oral chelating agent. It can be given over a long period (weeks to months). D-penicillamine has been used mainly for children with blood lead levels < 45 ug/dL.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. D-penicillamine enhances urinary excretion of lead, although not as effectively as CaNa2EDTA. Its specific mechanism and site of action are not well understood.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. D-penicillamine is administered orally. It is available in capsules or tablets (125 mg and 250 mg). These capsules can be opened and suspended in liquid, if necessary. The usual dose is 25 to 35 mg/kg/day in divided doses. Side effects can be minimized, to an extent, by starting with a small dose and increasing it gradually, monitoring all the time for side effects. For example, 25% of the desired final dose could be given in week 1, 50% in week 2, and the full dose by week 3.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. Toxic side effects (albeit minor in most cases) occur in as many as 33% of patients given the drug. The main side effects of D-penicillamine are reactions resembling those of penicillin sensitivity, including rashes, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hematuria, proteinuria and hepatocellular enzyme elevations, and eosinophilia. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are infrequent. Of most concern, however, are isolated reports of nephrotoxicity, possibly from hypersensitivity reactions. For these reasons, patients should be carefully and frequently monitored for clinically obvious side effects, and frequent blood counts, urinalyses, and renal function tests should be performed. In particular, blood counts and urinalyses should be done on day 1, day 14, day 28, and monthly thereafter. If the absolute neutrophil count falls to < 1500/uL, the count should be rechecked immediately, and treatment should be stopped if it falls to < 1200/uL. D-penicillamine should not be given on an outpatient basis if exposure to lead is continuing or the physician has doubts about compliance with the therapeutic regimen. D-PENICILLAMINE SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS WITH KNOWN PENICILLIN ALLERGY.\nSUCCIMER\nThe FDA approved succimer in January, 1991 for treating children with blood lead levels > 45 ug/dL. Succimer appears to be an effective oral chelating agent. Its selectivity for lead is high, whereas its ability to chelate essential trace metals is low. Although its use to date has been limited, succimer appears to have promising potential, and a broader range of clinical research studies in children are being undertaken.\nSuccimer is chemically similar to BAL but is more water soluble, has a high therapeutic index, and is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is effective when given orally and produces a lead diuresis comparable to that produced by CaNa2EDTA. This diuresis lowers blood lead levels and reverses the biochemical toxicity of lead, as indicated by normalization of circulating aminolevulinic acid dehydrase levels. Succimer is not indicated for prophylaxis of lead poisoning in a lead-containing environment. AS WITH ALL CHELATING AGENTS, SUCCIMER SHOULD ONLY BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN WHO RESIDE IN ENVIRONMENTS FREE OF LEAD DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT.\nMECHANISM OF ACTION. Succimer appears to be more specific for lead than the most commonly used chelating agent, CaNa2EDTA; the urinary loss of essential trace elements (for example, zinc) appears to be considerably less with succimer than with CaNa2EDTA. The site of lead chelation by succimer is not known.\nROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE. Succimer is administered orally. It is available in 100 mg capsules. The recommended initial dose is 350 mg/square m (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours for 5 days, followed by 350 mg/square (10 mg/kg) every 12 hours for 14 days. A course of treatment, therefore, lasts 19 days. If more courses are needed, a minimum of 2 weeks between courses is preferred, unless blood lead levels indicate the need for immediate retreatment. These doses may be modified as more experience is gained in using succimer.\nPatients who have received therapeutic courses of CaNa2EDTA with or without BAL may use succimer for subsequent treatment after an interval of 4 weeks. Data on the concomitant use of succimer and CaNa2EDTA with or without BAL are not available, and such use is not recommended.\nIf young children cannot swallow capsules, succimer can be administered by separating the capsule and sprinkling the medicated beads on a small amount of soft food or by putting them on a spoon and following with a fruit drink. Data are not available on how stable succimer is when it is suspended in soft foods for prolonged periods of time; succimer should be mixed with soft foods immediately before being given to the child.\nPRECAUTIONS AND TOXICITY. To date, toxicity due to succimer (transient elevations in hepatic enzyme activities) appears to be minimal. The most common adverse effects reported in clinical trials in children and adults were primarily gastrointestinal and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite loss. Rashes, some necessitating discontinuation of therapy, have been reported for about 4% of patients. THOUGH SUCCIMER HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF LEAD POISONING, CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SUCCIMER IS LIMITED. Consequently, the full spectrum and incidence of adverse reactions, including the possibility of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions, have not been determined. Other precautions that need to be taken with succimer are discussed in the full statement.\nTREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS > OR = 20 UG/DL.\nThe single most important factor in managing of childhood lead poisoning is the reducing the child's exposure to lead; some children, however, will benefit from chelation therapy. Sample regimens for treating children with lead poisoning are described in Chapter 7.\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING (WITH OR WITHOUT ENCEPHALOPATHY)\nChildren with symptomatic lead poisoning (with or without encephalopathy) must be treated only at a pediatric center that has an intensive care unit. They should be managed by a multi disciplinary team that includes, as needed, critical care, toxicology, neurology, and neurosurgery. The child's neurological status and fluid balance must be carefully monitored.\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC LEAD POISONING\nBlood lead level > or = 45 ug/dL. Children with blood lead levels > or = 45 ug/dL (with or without symptoms) should undergo chelation therapy. A blood lead level > or = 70 ug/dL is a medical emergency.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 25 TO 44 UG/DL. For this blood lead range, the effectiveness of chelation therapy in decreasing the adverse effects of lead on children's intelligence has not been shown. Treatment regimens vary from clinic to clinic. Some practitioners treat children with lead levels in this range pharmacologically, some use D-penicillamine. The minimum medical management for children with these blood lead levels is to decrease exposure to all sources of lead, to correct any iron deficiency and maintain an adequate calcium intake, and to test frequently to ensure that the child's blood lead levels are decreasing. Many experienced practitioners decide whether to use chelation therapy on the basis of the results of carefully performed CaNa2EDTA mobilization tests.\nBLOOD LEAD LEVEL 20 TO 24 UG/DL. ONLY VERY MINIMAL DATA EXISTS ABOUT CHELATING CHILDREN WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS BELOW 25 UG/DL, AND SUCH CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE CHELATED EXCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF APPROVED CLINICAL TRIALS. A child with a confirmed blood lead level of 20 to 24 ug/dL will require individual case management by a pediatric health-care provider. The child should have an evaluation with special attention to nutritional and iron status. The parents should be taught about 1) the causes and effects of lead poisoning, 2) the need for more routine blood lead testing, 3) possible sources of lead intake and how to reduce them, 4) the importance of adequate nutrition and of foods high in iron and calcium, and 5) resources for further information. (This is described in more detail in Chapter 4.) Sequential measurements of blood lead levels along with review of the child's clinical status should be done at least every 3 months. Iron deficiency should be treated promptly. Children with blood lead levels in this range should be referred for environmental investigation and management. Identifying and eradicating all sources of excessive lead exposure is the most important intervention for decreasing blood lead levels (Chapter 8).\nPOST-CHELATION FOLLOWUP\nAt the end of each treatment cycle, the blood lead concentration usually declines to < 25 ug/dL. Within a few days, however, reequilibration among body lead compartments takes place and may result in a rebound; thus, THE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL MUST BE RECHECKED 7 TO 21 DAYS AFTER TREATMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER RETREATMENT IS NECESSARY.\nChildren who undergo chelation treatment require long-term followup preferably from pediatric health-care providers, nutritionists, environmental specialists, and community out-reach workers. Community outreach workers provide a critical bridge between hospital-based or clinic-based (outpatient) medical care, health advocacy education, and environmental remediation outside the hospital. Children should NEVER be discharged from the hospital UNTIL THEY CAN GO TO A LEAD-FREE ENVIRONMENT. Lead-free safe housing (with friends, relatives, or in designated transitional housing), in which a treated child can live during the entire abatement process through the post-abatement clean-up, must be arranged. With appropriately carried-out public health measures, complete and safe abatement should be achieved during the treatment period.\nOnce a child is discharged to a safe environment, frequent followup is mandatory. In general, depending on the initial blood lead value, most children who require chelation therapy must be followed closely for at least one year or more. All children undergoing chelation treatment should be seen every other week for 6-8 weeks, then once a month for 4-6 months. A child treated with BAL and CaNa2EDTA should be followed more closely: weekly for 4 to 6 weeks, then monthly for 12 months.\nCHAPTER 8. MANAGEMENT OF LEAD HAZARDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD\nEradicating childhood lead poisoning requires a long-term active program of primary lead-poisoning prevention, including abatement of lead-based paint hazards in homes, day-care centers, and other places where young children play and live. For the child who is lead poisoned, however, efficient and effective interventions are needed as quickly as possible. Abatement means making the source of lead inaccessible to the child.\nEach situation in which a child gets poisoned is unique and must be evaluated by a person or team of persons skilled and knowledgeable about lead poisoning, hazard identification, and interventions to reduce lead exposure, including abatement of lead-based paint in housing. Childhood lead poisoning prevention programs need to work closely with other relevant agencies (for example, housing and environmental agencies) to ensure that the quickest and most effective approach is taken to remediating the environments of poisoned children.\nEnvironmental case management includes a number of actions prescribed for a child with lead poisoning. Ideally, environmental case management should be conducted by a team of professionals in public health, environmental activities, medical management, and social management. A team approach to intervention will help ensure that followup is timely and effective. The management team may need to solve many related problems, such as whether to investigate supplemental addresses, where to find temporary alternative housing, and how to use community resources to assist the family in dealing with the lead-poisoned child.\nCHAPTER 9. MANAGEMENT OF LEAD HAZARDS IN THE COMMUNITY\nIn theory, primary prevention has always been the goal of childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. In practice, however, most programs focus exclusively on secondary prevention, dealing with children who have already been poisoned. As programs shift the emphasis to primary prevention, their efforts must be designed to systematically identify and remediate environmental sources of lead, including, most importantly, dwellings containing old lead paint.\nThe shift from case management to community-level intervention will require a fundamental shift in perspective. The focus must shift from the individual child to the population of children at risk and the environment in which they live. The purpose of community-level intervention is to identify and respond to sources, not cases, of lead poisoning. The responsibility for addressing lead poisoning will have to be expanded beyond health agencies to include a variety of housing, environmental and social service agencies at the local, county state and national level.\nPOINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS DOCUMENT:\nTo request a copy of this document or for questions concerning this document, please contact the person or office listed below.

The wages may differ substantially for the same kind of job in the same locality\n93.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Domestic workers have no specific terms of employment, no rigid job description, no social security benefits (provident fund, gratuity, pension, medical facilities), no provision for paid leave etc. Strangely, part time workers may be better off than full time workers, and full time workers better off than full time cum live-in workers Often if a worker takes leave for more than a few days, she is expected to provide a substitute or she is dismissed on-the-spot, or she may come back only to find that she has been replaced permanently There is no protective legislation to protect their interest A unique feature of domestic workers is that each worker is isolated from the other and the problem of organising them is almost insurmountable. It is difficult to make them meet to discuss their problems and develop a common identity.\n94.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In short, female domestic workers are subjected to the worst kind of exploitation It is not only that they work on casual and temporary basis, suffer from total casualisation of work and are devoid of legal protection, particularly In terms of payment of wages and hours of work but they are often suspected for thefts and harassed by the employer as well as the police. They remain voiceless and nameless spectators of their misfortune\n95.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is felt that these workers urgently need recognition of their status as workers, legal protection for better wages, fair and strictly adhered to terms of employment (hours of work, leave, etc.), and social security benefits, provision of proper living quarters, including low cost hostels for single women, which will remove them from their employers constant demands and supervision; strictly enforced educational and recreational facilities for children, to facilitate their general development and assure them the chance of seeking alternative employment.39\n96.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Female Vendors and Hawkers Mobile vendors and hawkers, petty traders engaged in selling vegetables, fruits, cloth and garments, cutlery, pots and pans, bangles and toys, cooked food and exchanging goods for old clothes and other household effects constitute another group of highly vulnerable female workers who are subjected to perpetual harassment by the authorities and the community, In fact, they are viewed as anti-social elements under the Indian Police Act, the Indian Railways Act and by the town planning authorities Urban planners frequently consider them as impediments to planning and dysfunctional appendages to the city economies. Their activities are labelled as \"unauthorised\", regardless of the fact that this system offers opportunities for employment, cheap and convenient distribution of commodities. Their needs and functions are thus totally ignored by the planners\n97.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The vendors and hawkers, play a very important role In the economy by providing goods and services at a cheap price at the doorstep A woman vendor operates on a small scale, most of them toiling for 10-12 hours per day, yet scarcely earning Rs 10-15 a day In urban areas, they are largely concentrated In and around high density pockets like public markets, points of transportation, commercial centres and entertainment zones In Delhi, in 95 or more weekly bazars, there are over 9000 women vendors struggling to earn a living through vending What haunts the poor vendors is the lack of capital and space for marketing and displaying their products and recognition of their work by the authorities In several cities, the vendors and hawkers are not entitled to licences to work and are harassed, even prosecuted for selling their products They often have to bribe the police and other authorities to be able to continue their struggle for survival by selling what they possess\n50\n98.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are instances when basket vendors are forced to pay bribes of Rs 30-40 to the police for selling their baskets In market places Creating obstacles and hindrances In their profession, forcing them to withdraw from their activities by means of frequent arrests, imposition of penalties and fines, confiscation of their goods, dragging them to court cases only add to their miseries and poverty There are a lucky few who have been able to take advantage of some schemes operated under the DIP and the SEPUP (Self-Employment for Urban Poor) The lot of the rest is anybody's guess\n99.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expected that recognition of their role and provision of space for carrying out their business,systematic licence system, social welfare programmes, including education and training, and assistance for expanding their business by providing suitable credit, inputs and marketing facilities would go long way In improving their status and earning capacity 40\n100.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women In Dairying Women's contribution to dairying ranges from collection of fodder, to milching of animals, cleaning and washing, and taking care of the animals Not only they are the last to go to the bed, but they are the first to rise as early as around 2 30 A M for preparing animals for milching Yet they hardly have any say, In owning the animals, or the cash income obtained from the sale of milk\n101.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even In the milk cooperatives, women are seldom included as members and are rarely seen on the managing committees In fact, women's cooperatives are a rare event it is an irony that most of them, though the providers of milk, do not get milk for their personal consumption Being outside the cooperatives they do not get a fair price for the milk, or proper marketing outlets and are often In the clutches of the local moneylender or local procurers of milk They are also the victim of other practices like sharing of milk and animals which works to their utter disadvantages\n102.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are some success stories of the dairy cooperatives of women which show that women can manage the cooperatives equally well and use their income for the betterment of the family Several suggestions offered to protect the interest of women engaged In dairying include (i) fifty per cent of members of milk cooperatives should be women, (ii) each cooperative should have two female members on the managing committees, (111) 10 to 30 per cent of cooperatives should be exclusively women's cooperatives, and (iv) DRDAs should have lady extension officers to involve women as beneficiaries and as owner of milch animal 41\n103.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in Construction Women engaged in construction work are one of the most exploited group of workers They suffer from the temporary and shifting nature of this work, to hardships of great physical labour in all types of weather and exploitation from middlemen and contractors They toil hard, earn meagre wages, and struggle with insecurity looming large over their heads Frequent changes In their work-sites and instability of their work, deprive them and their children from primary facilities like health, education and ration cards Their health problems become worse on account of unhealthy surrounding, hazardous nature of work and low and irregular wages which is below even subsistence level They are largely engaged as unskilled workers even though they perform a highly specialised work More paying and so-called skilled jobs are invariably taken up by males, the idea of women entering these areas is just unthinkable Employers seldom pay them wages on time, the payments remain unsettled even when they are leaving the work site or leaving for their native place Often they nave to make a futile chase In locating their ex-employers on return from their native homes\n104.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the 1981 Census out of a total of 36 lakh construction workers, 10 per cent were female The corresponding NSSO figure In 1983 is 65 lakh of whom 15 per cent constitute female workers\n51\n105.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The variability in labour absorption in construction work is much more pronounced for women than for men It has been often noticed that whenever there is any increase in demand for labour this sector, the rise in the female employment rates is much greater than that of males On the other hand, whenever there is any shrinkage in the workforce, the fall is more drastic in the case of female workers than of the males It appears that women construction workers form a reserve army coming to the aid of the construction industry and are first to get retrenched when the work slows down\n106.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the construction workers are covered under various acts like the Minimum Wages Act, the Contract Labour Act and the inter-state Migrant Workers Act, these acts exist in paper only, in practice they are blatantly violated by the employers Several steps which are likely to help these workers include (i) stringent enforcement of the provisions of the laws, (11) strict punishment for the violation, (iii) allowing trade unions and NGOs to file cases of violation of the labour laws, (iv) welfare programmes financed by the employers or contractors, (v) provision of educational training for upgrading their skills, (vi) designing of tools and equipments to make the work less hazardous and less arduous for women, (vii) provision of welfare facilities like creches, medical doctor/mobile dispensary etc , (viii) organisation of the women construction workers to protect their rights and fight against exploitation 42\n107.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in Mining and Quarrying Mining and quarrying has been another important sector employing poor women in all kinds of strenuous and hazardous work The abolition of underground work by women in mines (1929) and prohibition of work in night shifts (1952) and introduction of new improved technology, particularly, after the nationalization of coal mines has led to considerable decline in the share of women workers in mines. In fact the introduction of improved technology in mines. has led to 'voluntary' retirement and \"golden handshake\" for women resulting in 30 per cent decline in famale workers in coal mines. in eighties\n108.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The major problems confronting women in this sector include (i) high incidence of casualization as women are predominantly enagaged as contract workers, (ii) insecurity of employment, (iii) low wages, (iv) very low percentage of permanency (43.6 per cent of women workers are permanent as against 78.5 per cent of male workers), (v) non-enforcement of labour laws, (vi) incidence of bonded labour system in some mines. particularly in quarrying, and (vii) hazardous and strenuous nature of work Here again what is needed is the strict enforcement of labour legislation and provision of welfare programmes including education and training for acquisition of skills. 43\n109.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in Food Processing The food processing industry is one of the earliest home based industries, where work is largely performed by poor women The industry covers a wide range of items like processing of vegetables, fruits, pickles, chutneys, papad, chips, spices, a variety of perishable food items It is recently emerging as an export oriented industry where thirty per cent of its products are being exported.\nTypically the production process in food processing is carried out in several forms/levels, these may be broadly categorised as follows:\nHome based level: Working as a family, or under the putting out sub-contracting system, producing snacks with a shelf-life.\nStreet-level: Working as a family with or without one or two employees, producing ready-to-eat snacks, beverages and/or cheap meals.\nShop-level: With 5-8 employees, making products with a shelf life for packaging.\nCanteen-level: With 5-10 employees, making products with a shelf life for packaging.\nWorkshop level: About 25 employees, producing products with a shelf-life.\nFactory-level: Generally automated plants.\n52\n110.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The greatest number of women are employed in the home-based production. It is very low at the street, shop and at factory levels. Usually the work is seasonal and the demand for products fluctuates. About 40 to 50 per cent of workers in this industry do not get regular work. Sub-contracting is widespread as it ensures that the scattered workers do not get united and therefore labour laws could be circumvented. In traditional mode of production women labour is clearly preferred as they can be paid very little and are less demanding. A woman engaged in papad making earns bare Rs. 5 to Rs. 7 per day after putting in 6 to 7 hours of strenuous work.\n111.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mechanisation often displaces women by men. Even with small introduction of mechanisation women are thrown out of employment and their work is taken over by the men. Job experience is of little value to workers as women working for 15 years and more have little improvement in their wage and status.\n112.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marketing is done at many levels; residence, door to door, street, shop levels. Women are not significantly involved in marketing.\n113.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The most-regrettable fact is the lack of data on these women. There are some women's organisations in the food processing industry, such as Indira Kitchens or Lijjat Papad, Annapurana Mahila Mandal and others which have lend some viability to female workers engaged in this profession.\n114.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is high time to recognise the status of these women workers, provide them legal protection (strict enforcement) for better wages, job security and social security benefits, regular employment, free them from the shackles of middlemen (which cuts into their wages and takes marketing out of their control) alongwith restriction of sub-contracting and putting out system and provide easy access to credit, education, training for their betterment.44\n115.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in Fisheries: India has a 6000 Km. long coastline and a large number of rivers which support about 65 lakh fishermen. In fisheries women are mainly involved in all process after the fish is landed. The main operations in which women are involved include (i) fish vending, (ii) fish processing\u0097drying and curing, (iii) prawn processing, (iv) loading and unloading, (v) net making.\n116.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marketing is often done house to house or at the rural market or in towns by the women fish vendors. In areas where fish is caught in bulk, the bulk transportation to major cities is done by males. The fisherwomen travel long distances to purchase fish from wholesale markets (about 40 to 80 Km. in Bombay) and disperse to their own vending places. The problem faced by female fish vendors are (i) middlemen who treat them roughly and brutally, and cheat them in transactions; (ii) lack of ready cash/credit; (iii) problems of transportation to the market\u0097uncertainty of transport, expensive private transport, discrimination against women in public transport and unreasonable transport charges for carrying load; (iv) exploitative market taxes (though the rates are stipulated by the local authorities, in many markets the right to collect taxes is auctioned to private persons who enhance the charges at their will); (v) the perishable nature of this commodity; (vi) the squabbles and games in the auctions, which are often not fairly conducted; (vii) the squabble for vending space, between men and women, and between women themselves; (viii) harassment by police, municipal authorities, since they are seldom granted licence; and (ix) seasonal nature of work.\n117.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is hardly any fishing during the monsoons. When women are involved in large-scale vending, they have to go to distant landing centres to purchase fish. This leads to special problems as they are not permitted to travel in trains and therefore have to hire lorries, sitting for 20-24 hours with their loads to get back to their home areas.\n118.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several women are engaged only in drying fish and selling it in wholesale or retail markets. The wholesaler normally takes six months to make payments. The major problem\n53\nfaced by these women include: lack of regular supply of fish for drying; difficulties in procuring salt at market rates as the merchants deliberately increase the price of salt in coastal areas; lack of drying and storage space.\n119.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women involved in prawn processing have special problems. They are engaged mainly in shelling, grading and packaging. Often the contractors prefer young and unmarried women displacing older fisherwomen who have no other means of livelihood. The younger women living far away from their families, are more easily exploited and controlled.\n120.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in shelling sheds are mostly engaged as casual workers earning barely Rs. 5-6 a day. Women working as graders though categorised as \"skilled\", get the same wages as the men who are engaged in loading and cleaning as unskilled workers. Earning of these women rarely exceeds Rs. 500 per month.\n121.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large contractors often provide living quarters to fisherwomen at congested places close to the workshed or factory but far away from urban centres leading to complete isolation of the women from the outside world. Their free movement is restricted and even letters are intercepted. They often work for long hours i.e. 12 hours at a stretch beginning any time of the day or night. As contractors are not licenced, they are not covered by any legislation. The workers are engaged on casual or temporary basis or paid only in the fishing season i.e. from August to April and they have to pay for the return passage out of their own savings.\n122.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the large fish landing centres, the job of loading and unloading is taken by women at a rate of one rupee per basket. Women are forced to accept such low wages because of mechanization which has reduced wages and displaced them entirely. These women have to work wading in knee-deep water with heavy loads which is hazardous. The prolonged exposure to water affects their health adversely.\n123.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women engaged in net making, especially in the coastal regions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, generally buy the twine themselves, maintaining control over the entire production and marketing process. They mostly work on a putting-out system, and are paid by the kilo, earning Rs. 3-4 per eight hours of work. The major problems faced by them are low rates for piece-rate work. Their existing work is being threatening by the introduction of machines for nylon-net manufacture.\n124.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women in fisheries are completely neglected. The Fisheries Departments in different States know very little about their working conditions and their needs. Fisher-women's cooperatives have come up in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but in the absence of adequate financial and technical support from the State the cooperatives are facing difficulties.\n125.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modernisation of fishing has also adversely affected the fisherwomen. It has displaced them without providing any alternative employment. There is urgent need for taking up a multi-prolonged strategy to ensure a fair deal and returns, to poor fisherwomen. It is necessary to provide protection and regeneration of fish resources, recognize the status of fisherwomen as workers, provide them licences, covered them with protective legislations for better wages and working conditions, provide them social security benefits, promote women's cooperatives, and impart them necessary education, skill and training for handling new technologies. 45\n126.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are many more sectors in which female workers are equally invisible, equally neglected and equally exploited. Women workers in sericulture and silk industry, garment industry, tobacco processing, migrant workers, sweepers, devdasis, cart pullers, dock workers, dais, rag pickers, washer women, hamlas, prostitutes and even factory workers have similar stories to tell. These women have similar problems. They are invisible as workers and are therefore not recognised as workers by planners. There are no laws to protect them from exploitation, or laws are blatantly violated, or sometimes the existing laws are against them\n54\nTheir working and living conditions are miserable. They are not helped even by trade unions or NGOs, and there are no programmes for their upliftment from the government either.\n127.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus the poor working females in our economy are put in a highly disadvantageous situation. Broad trends in their employment pattern show that the economic development process has not yet brought out the desired changes in their economic life. Their problems are so complex and vexing that no single approach can provide a solution. It is only through a mass based organised effort that they can hope for the much promised fair deal envisaged in the constitutional and legislative provisions. Perhaps, it may, require a total national movement exploiting, to the fullest extent, all the available institutions. Governmental and non-Governmental within the framework of micro planning. What is needed is an individualised approach, meeting the basic needs in the areas of health, education and work opportunities. The poor need to be sensitised about their rights, demand the same and fight against the oppressed and exploitative order in an organised manner.\nAnnex I\nSex Ratio of Workers (Other than Cultivators and Agricultural Labourers) in 1971 and 1981 in Traditional, Modem and Mixed Sectors\nSector\n"}, {"score": 332.36835, "uuid": "1eef5888-b2f4-51ba-b809-663c4d0d8a48", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1110wb-91-17804", "target_hostname": "www.museum.manchester.ac.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/community/blogs/", "page_rank": 1.5482946e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Blogs (The University <em>of</em> Manchester)", "snippet": "Next door to the allotment <em>is</em> a flowerbed <em>which</em> was planted with shrubs; a nice mix <em>of</em> <em>plants</em> <em>which</em> are often used for landscaping <em>in</em> urban green spaces. <em>Is</em> your balcony an oasis for bees?

Everyone must contribute.\n(8) Read a fiction work called \"Lucifer\u2019s Hammer\" Really makes one think. Great survival research went into that one. Plus It will keep you awake nights reading.\nFIRE BUSH MEMORY HELPER:*\n1) Have your matches container attached ON YOU & WATER TIGHT.\n2) An axe is the most important tool in the bush, more so than the gun, bow and arrow, next in line is a good machete or those new all purpose shovels. pix*\n3) The hunting knife comes next, but well sharpened & A GOOD ONE.\n4) A bit of snare wire, some small waxed string & a long leather shoe lace, a strong rope, are more useful than a gun.\nA) Snare wire, to snare rabbits, partridge & trout.\nB) Wax string to attach which you'll have to make in survival\nC) Strong rope to suspend your game, or attach big snare, pulling.\nD) Well oiled leather string to tie your luggage, transport pull an animal from water\n5) THIS BOOK FOR ALL KIND OF USES & S/KIT.

It provides warmth, protection, a means of signaling, boils water, cooks and preserves food.\nYOU MUST LEARN TO LIGHT A FIRE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS ANYWHERE, FAST & ANY TIME. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW ALL THE METHODS YOU HAVE TO BE EXPERT AT THEM. FIRST ESSENTIAL ABILITY:\nTHE ABILITY TO LIGHT FIRE UNDER ALL KIND OF CONDITIONS IS ONE OF THE FIRST ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE IN SURVIVAL. THUS YOUR ABILITY TO DO SO WILL GIVE YOU GREATER CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES IN ALL AVENUES OF LIFE AND SPECIALLY IN SURVIVAL.\nWARNING! WARNING! WARNING!\nSURVIVAL KNIVES:\nA strong knife is the survivor's best friend. Not all knives are created equal. Utility and strength are the hallmarks of any survival knife. It MUST have a full tang; the portion of the blade that extends into the handle for maximum strength. A knife with full tang has a blade that is one solid piece from the tip to the butt of the handle. The design is standard for all GI-issue knives as well as high-quality civilian models. A survival knife also has saw-teeth cut into the back, or \"spine\" of the blade opposite the cutting edge. These are not designed to saw through branches but to cut shallow, squared grooves into wood and bone.\nA shallow groove cut into two sides of a sapling will prevent a tied rope from sliding along its length, and sharp sided notches are vital to the construction of quality snares and deadfall. Its handle should ALWAYS be contoured to fit its user's hand and should ALWAYS have a grooved, checkered or knurled surface. A smooth handle is slippery when wet or while the user is wearing gloves, making the knife hard to get a grip on and dangerous. The knife should also have a wide finger-guard that extends beyond the blade in either direction. This will prevent the hand from sliding over the blade if a slip should occur. Finger-guards on some newer survival knife have a flat and cross-point screwdriver tip ground\ninto either end.\nThe butt end of the handle should terminate in a solid, heavy, and firmly attached butt cap. The butt cap is meant to be used as a hammer, and MUST be equal to the task. One survival knife; the Imperial Schrade M-7S, has a unique butt cap that's squared on 3 sides for hammering and has a claw-type nail puller and ice claw on the forth.\nIt's important that the blade have a \"false\" or unsharpened edge running 2 or 3 inches along the spine and down to the tip. The false edge is not usually sharpened because its purpose is to penetrate rather than to cut. Having a false edge makes the blade terminate in a needle-like point, very useful for drilling holes in wood, bone or leather.\nBefore buying a survival knife, give some consideration to the type of ground edge it has. Sharpness at this point is not important, but the shape of the edge itself is.\nTHERE ARE 5 BASIC EDGE TYPES:\nThey are saber-ground, flat-ground, hollow-ground, semi-hollow ground and diamond-ground. The ground edge is what determine how strong the blade is and how sharp it can be made. Until recently the saber ground edge was the standard for survival knives, military blades and bayonets and in general still is. But now the new US Army M (Field knife made by Buck) has a semi-hollow ground edge.\nThe saber-ground edge is shaped like a V, beginning about half way down the blade and ending in a point at the cutting edge. It is difficult to sharpen because the entire surface of the ground edge MUST be honed down to make the point formed at the cutting edge sharp. It also dulls rather quickly regardless of how hard the steel is because the V formed by the edge is wide. (The narrower the V, the sharper the edge.) The advantage of the sabre-ground edge is that the maker need remove only a minimum amount of material from the blade, leaving fully half of it at full thickness. The result is a blade that it can with practice & work, be made sharp enough to shave the hair off someone's arm while retaining enough brute strength to withstand the abuse of being used a prybar, wedge, or climbing tool. The legendary Marine Corps K-Bar Fighting knife and the USAF Pilot's survival knife have saber-ground edges.\nThe flat-ground edge is similar tooth V formed by the sabre-ground edge, except that it begins at the blade's spine and ends at the cutting edge giving the entire blade a sharp \"V\" shape. A flat-ground blade is necessarily wide in comparison to its thickness but can be honed to razor sharpness with little trouble and retains a functional cutting edge very well. It is not as strong as the sabre-ground edge because more steel is removed when the edge is formed, but many experienced woodsmen have been willing to make the sacrifice. The Trailmaster, a large Bowie knife from the Cold Steel company, has a flat-ground edge, as do many folding knives. The hollow-ground edge is the sharpest of them all. This is the edge found on straight razors and a few fillet knifes. It is formed by grinding a wide groove along the length of the blade on either side, beginning at the spine of the blade and ending at the cutting edge. Unfortunately, so much metal is removed from the blade to form the edge that it becomes downright weak. Consequently, no companies are making a hollow-ground belt knife and it is just as well.\nThe semi-hollow ground edge is another matter. This edge has such a strong following that is can be found on nearly every hunting knife ever made. It is formed by grinding a groove length-wise along either side of the blade, much the same as the hollow-ground edge. The difference is that the semi-hollow edge has a much smaller radius, beginning only halfway down the blade and ending at the cutting edge. This leaves half the blade a full thickness to maximize the strength while narrowing the cutting edge into a sharp V that will take and hold a very keen honed edge. Because of the advent of superior alloys and heat treating methods, this edge is gaining still more popularity among survivalists & professional woodsmen for whom a broken knife is not just an inconvenience but a serious problem. The Gerber BMF Survival knife, US Navy UDT knife and the Buck M9 Field knife have semi-hollow ground edges.\nThe last type or diamond-ground edge is unique to double-edges knives & daggers. Essentially a saber-ground edge that has been duplicated on what would otherwise be the spine of the blade, it produces a second cutting edge. However this edge can not be made sharp and is inherently weak because so much metal is removed from the blade. Better to stay away from that type of knife is our advice.\nBOWIE-TYPE SURVIVAL KNIFE:\nThe Rambo type has the characteristics that distinguish the Bowie from other blades' types is its wide, thick blade, good balance, heavy finger-guard and a long false edge. Today there are at least a dozen hollow-handle survival knives on the market, proof enough that the design has following among outdoorsmen.\nAt first glance it appears to be a wonderful idea to use the handle as a storage place for survival items, until one REMEMBERS that that's where the tang should be. Hollow knives have no tang to speak of because the blade mounts to the handle rather than running though it. The design quite virtually takes the backbone out of the knife, making it prone to breakage during hard use. I suggest that anyone in the market for a serious survival knife that carries its own emergency items give some consideration to knives like the Imperial Schrade M-7S or Gerber BMF.\nBoth of these offer the strength of a full tang and come with sheath pouches containing compass, matches, wire-saw and fishing tackle. Having said that, we recommend that anyone who still wants a hollow-handle knife purchase the Buckmaster made by Buck Knives.\nThe so-called \"blood grooves\" still found on many blades including the legendary K-Bar should be avoided. Folded knives have little value as general duty survival knives because, like hollow-handle knives, they have no tang. Still the folding knife has a place in the survivalist's kit. The large size and brute strength of the general survival knife, so desirable for building shelters, butchering large animals, and a host of other heavy chores, work against its delicate tasks. Fashioning wooden implements and sensitive snare triggers and filleting fish are best accomplished by smaller, thinner blades. For these and many other light duty chores, we recommend any good 3 blades stockman knife. Personally I love the Swiss Army knife.\nChoosing a survival knife with so much variety of brands, sizes and styles can be a confusing experience.\nFIRE STARTING TOOLS:\nMatches are something every woodsman MUST HAVE AT ALL TIMES. Used carefully, a single book of matches is capable of starting 25 fires; 2 books = 40 fires. Assuming that the survivalist is walking back to civilization, at that the average person can walk 25 miles a day, if he makes a new campfire each night and does not waste any matches, he will have to walk 500 miles before exhausting a single book.\nWooden \"strike anywhere\" safety matches offer the advantage of being hotter burning and less apt to be blown out by a breeze but these can be quite volatile often igniting against themselves. Many a woodsman, myself included, has had the unpleasant experience of having a pocketful of these little wonders ignite from rubbing against one another. So ALWAYS carry them in an airtight container.\nThe newest breed of wooden matches is a bit safer. They are equally to being blown out, but will only light when struck against the igniter strip on the side of the box they come in. These can be carried in a match holder, pill bottle or even wrapped in a plastic sandwich bag as a protection against moisture, but they are useless unless a section of the igniter is included. Disposable butane lighters are one of the many modern technologies most of have come to take for granted.\nA single Bic type lighter is the equivalent of about 100 books of matches and has the advantage of being impervious to water. If it becomes dunked all one has to do is wait until the flint and igniter wheel dry out & it's back in business. But the value of the butane lighter does not end when the supply of butane is exhausted. I have found that by removing the metal hood surrounding the gas port the lighter can be used as spark-thrower to ignite dried grass, cotton fibers and other fine tender. It seems the flint in a disposable butane lighter ALWAYS lasts twice as long as its butane supply and that can be an advantage in the wilderness.\nChemical fire starters are also a great asset, especially in very cold or wet weather. Military Trioxane bars and the smaller Hexamine tablets, available in most Army-Navy surplus stores, are very stable, have an almost infinite shelf life, and burn with a hot, smokeless blue flame that can be used to start a fire with wet wood or windy conditions. Either of them can also be used alone to heat water or canned food. Trioxane comes in a box containing 3 foil-wrapped bars and retails for about $2.00 per box. Hexamine tablets come 6 to a cardboard tube and retail for around $1.00 per tube. Both of these are very effective for starting fires under adverse conditions, but I prefer the larger Trioxane bars. Having one of these in my pack has saved my fingers on several subzero mornings when the temperature was so low I had only seconds in which to get the fire started before my hands turned into frostbitten claws.\nThe magnesium fire-starting block comes onto the market almost a decade ago but has NEVER gained much popularity. This is one of those items that apparently works fine in the lab but not in the field. Better forget it altogether.\nCandles are on old tried and true fire starting aid that every woodsman should at least have one \"Emergency Candle\" in his pocket or kit to help light fires in wet weather. A LIT CANDLE PLACED UNDER A PILE EVEN OF THE WETTEST TWIGS WILL START A FIRE, EVEN IN A LIGHT RAIN. One of the beauty is that they are real cheap. Tea candles that come in their own metal container are also very cheap and in some cases even better.\nFISHING GEAR:\nThere is no reason for anyone venturing into or near wilderness to be without a good supply of fishing gear. Improvised hooks made of bone or wood and fishing line made of twisted plant fibers are things of the past and completely unnecessary for the modern woodsman to survive in the wild. Survivalists have ALWAYS realized the value of a fishing kit in the forest where streams are plentiful and fish provide an abundant & reliable source of food every month of the year.\nA good working fishing kit is so small and light that it will fit into a jacket pocket. The kit I have used for the past 10 years is self-contained, dirt cheap to make, and unbelievably effective. We have used it to take brook trout, bluegill, perch, rock bass, etc. The kit I used consists of a plastic 35 mm. film bottle with a Snap-On cap. The film bottle is my container of choice for most small items because it is unbreakable, tough and has a watertight seal. In it I place an assortment of long-shank hooks (they seem to be most effective), about a dozen split-shot sinkers at least 30 feet of 20 pound test mono-filament line held in a small coil with a rubber band or a wire tie, a scented rubber worm, and a Swedish Pimple or spinner for jigging. And even with all this, there is still room for swivels, a steel leader, extra hooks or a number of other small items. But the film bottle itself is an important part of the fishing kit. With a few wraps of brightly colored vinyl tape around its circumference that can be used for many uses, it will also work efficiently as a fishing float or \"bobber\".\nAs an alternative, making a bobber from a twig is simple. First select a dry softwood twig about 4 inches long and 3/4 of inch in diameter (these dimensions are not critical and are given only as suggestion). Remove the bark, if the twig is dry it should come off easily with your thumbnail. If the wood is darkened scrape the surface lightly with a knife until the entire surface is a light tan color. Remove about 2 inches of colored vinyl tape from the film bottle. Lay the fishing line parallel along the surface of the twig, fastening the two together. The bobber can now be slid along the line until the desired depth is achieved. The emptied bottle can be used in the same way. Artificial bait (lures) can be very effective for catching fish without the conventional rod and reel.\nA small spinner can be used for jigging in pools or slow moving streams and will be active enough in fast moving streams to attract trout and creek chubs. Swedish Pimples are probably the most effective lures for bass, crappies, perch and sunfish. A scented rubber worm is attractive to all types of fish and can be cut into small sections to extend its usefulness. Floating flies are effective for catching trout, bass and perch, and are also easily tied in the field using thread, feathers, animal fur or even one's own hair. Live bait can be found at nearly any time of the year, including winter. Earthworms are available on the banks of rivers, streams and lakes until the ground freezes in winter.\nGrasshoppers, crickets, bees and most any other insects will be attractive to most type of fishes, especially bass and perches. Grubs, insect pupae and salamanders can be found in rotting stumps & logs throughout the year. Freshwater clams are excellent bait and they too can be found close to shore in lakes and streams at all times of the year. And ALWAYS REMEMBER that fishes are cannibalistic creatures. If more live bait is somehow unavailable, the first fish caught can be sacrificed as bait to catch others.\nOne item we believe should be a part of any woodsman's kit is the 4 tined frog spearhead. A spear-shaft can be quickly made from a straight green sapling and fastened securely to the spearhead simply by forcing the tapered shaft into it. The spear head cost only about $3.00 and could be used to take frogs, fish and even small animals.\nRabbit burrows are often shallow and straight, making it simple to thrust the spear through the burrow entrance and impale the rabbit. This tactic like many others in survival, is not pleasant, but when the alternative is starvation, the choice is easy.\nSHELTER MATERIALS: PONCHO:\nA PONCHO IS ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE TOOLS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THE ELEMENTS.\nIt can be worn as a raincoat, wrapped around a sleeping bag or bedroll to keep it dry, used as water-proof shelter, or to collect rain, shadow maker against a burning sun, or simply used to cover a person who MUST sleep in the open.\nSPACE BLANKET:\nThe basic model is simply a large sheet of reflective aluminum laminated plastic, usually 84 X 54 in 7 weighs about 2 ounces. It is reputed to be able to reflect up to 80% of a person's body heat back at them. My own experience is that it does not provide sufficient insulation by itself to keep a person warm in cold weather. It does however make a wonderful shelter roof, being waterproof and windproof. An added bonus is that its shiny silver coating turns the entire shelter into a giant mirror that is easily spotted from the air. A variation of this is the cloth backed vinyl sportsman's blanket, available in red, sliver or woodland camouflage. This blanket has about the same size as the space blanket, weighs 12 oz. but it is a bit more durable and made to be used over and over. Whereas the space-blanket is designed to be used only once.\nAnother inexpensive and effective shelter material is the polypropylene plastic sheeting used as tarpaulins and painter's drop cloths. It is light, water and windproof & is available in clear or black. We recommend the clear one because it is more easily spotted from the air and makes a more efficient solar still for collecting and purifying water.\nROPES:\nWhile not absolutely necessary to the construction of an emergency shelter, 100 feet or so of strong, light nylon cord is invaluable for erecting shelters quickly, not to mention the 100's uses it has around camp, including the use as heat booster in a campfire. P/S: You also MUST learn some basic knots. (Square/Bowline & Double half hitch.#?**)\nSIGNALS:\nThose in need of rescue should be aware of the techniques for alerting a search party to their whereabouts. The lost or stranded hunter needs to be especially well informed because he has not gotten a lot of time. It is rather hard fact that most hunters are given up for dead after a maximum of 72 hours in cold weather.\nThe signal flare is a tried and true method of signaling, but it can only be effective if the searchers are close enough to see its trail as it arcs through the sky. Even then the flare is only visible for only a few seconds and can be obscured from sight by high terrain. The most common type of signal flare is the single shot flare pistol. These pistols use a flare cartridge that resembles a 12 gauge shotgun shell. But be warned, flare pistols are usually constructed of cast metal or even plastic. NEVER attempt to fire a shotgun shell in on. They usually start around $60.00. Pencil flares are another more compact type of signal flare launcher. It is a compact tube slightly larger than a pencil. Since it is smaller than the flare pistol it also uses a smaller less obvious flare.\nWHISTLES:\nLoud piercing whistles have had some value in signaling search parties in the past, particularly in densely forested areas or under foggy conditions. The sound of a whistle will carry for miles in mountainous country. Sports whistles work very well, but there is currently a unit on the market that incorporates a liquid filled compass, match holder, signal whistle and lanyard. The entire unit is about 6 inches long by 2 inches in diameter and composed of orange plastic. About $5.00 it should be a welcome addition to any survival kit.\nFLASHLIGHTS:\nThey are not only generally useful, they make an excellent signaling device. New flashlight, most notably the near indestructible Mag-Lite, use high intensity Krypton or halogen bulbs that give the standard 2 cell D size flashlight as much brilliance as the old 6 volts type. Even the AA Mini Mag-Lite provides more light than standard D-cell flashlights.\nThere are currently several aluminum flashlights on the marker but we recommend the Mag-Lite by name because it has proven track record for durability, bulbs are readily available from most stores. They have adjustable beams that can be focused from broad to spotlight. As a signal the flashlight is useful only at night, but its beam can be seen from as far as 5 miles away, depending on the size and power of the light. Considering its utility, it would be foolish for anyone to venture into the wilderness without a good flashlight, spare batteries and an extra bulb, even if the light is just a cheap plastic model.\nFIRE AS SIGNAL: SEEN 15 MILES AWAY\nFire is also useful as a distress signal and in some situations it may even be the best way to attract help. A large but controllable signal fire built on the highest point possible will be visible from more than 15 miles away depending on weather conditions and is sure to be seen by passing aircraft.\nAS A SURVIVAL FIREARMS RIFLE IS BEST!:\nUnless at war a true survivalist does not need to be Rambo with its fully automatic weapon. The rifle is most often selected as a survival gun for a number of reasons. It has more range, accuracy and killing power than a handgun or shot gun in any given caliber. It is easy to become proficient with than a handgun, its ammunition is smaller than used in the shotgun; and finally, the rifle is more certain of getting the job done at longer ranges than either of the other two.\nYet even though nearly all experienced outdoorsmen agree that the rifle is best suited for the role of survival gun, there exists some disagreement about which caliber is most capable of meeting the needs of the survivalist. We believe the .22 Long Rifle is the best choice available for use in all-around survival rifle.\nWhy the .22? Versatility is the biggest reason. In the hands of a skilled marksman the vastly underrated long Rifle cartridge can and has been used to take nearly every edible animal on the N. American continent. We have used it successfully to take rabbits, porcupine, squirrels, ducks, geese, trout and even white tail deer at distances of up to\n100 yards. As a sporting cartridge, the .22 is illegal to use on many of these animals, but the need to eat in a survival situation is recognized by all. Apart form its proven killing power and accuracy, the .22 Long Rifle cartridge is even more attractive because of its small size and portability. The standard box of 50 rounds weighs only 6 oz. 500 rounds are more than sufficient for any contingency, including repeated signaling with gunshots, yet weigh less than 4 pounds.\nFor the woodsman who wants a survival gun but can not choose a rifle or shotgun, there is a very nice compromise from Savage Firearms. The Model 24 is an over and under shotgun/rifle combination and is available in a number of caliber/gauge combinations. Like 30/30/20 gauge, .22 Long Rifle/20 gauge or .22 Long Rifle/.410. When not in use the Model 24 breaks down into 3 separate pieces, the stock and receiver, the barrels and the forearm, and fits easily into a full size backpack.\nFollowing is a list of firearms that we have used and can recommend for use by anyone needing a firearm to provide themselves with food in an emergency. Two of them, the Charter Arms AR & and the Marlin 70P , are semi-autos with screw-off barrels that were designed specifically for use as backpack survival rifles. The AR-7 has long been a favorite of canoeists because its receiver and barrel can be detached form and stowed in the hollow plastic stock, making it the world's only floating rifle.\nMarlin Model 25 bolt-action .22 =$100.00 US\nCharter Arms AR-7 semi-auto .22 =$150.00\nSavage Model 24 over & under =$260.00\nArmscor Model 20P semi-auto .22 = $90.00\nMarlin Model 70P semi-auto .22 =$100.00\nMARKSMANSHIP:\nFar too many sports hunters take to the field with little or no shooting skills, secure in the fact that if they miss they can ALWAYS go home to a hot meal. But if you are stranded or injured you can not afford to be so blithe concerning your marksmanship. In the wild every single cartridge represents a meal or an important signal. Like all skills shooting has its own procedures and techniques that MUST be followed to become even mediocre.\nFirst is proper sight alignment. Place the rifle butt against the shoulder with the stock securely nested into the hollow of the shoulder. Lean forward slightly, NEVER backward. If the gun is equipped with telescopic sights, simply place the intersection of the cross-hair on the target and hold it as steadily as possible. If the gun has \"iron\" sights, look through the notch in the rear sight and align the front sight blade with it until the blade sits in the rear sight notch flush with its top. Place the aligned sights directly under the target. Whenever possible, rest the stock for-end (not the barrel) on a convenient tree branch or other supports to help hold it steady.\nNext is proper trigger squeeze. More shots are missed because of a jerked trigger than for any other reasons. The trigger of any riffles or pistol for that matter MUST ALWAYS be gently pulled back toward the shooter with the ball of the forefinger, directly opposite the fingernail and ahead of the first joint. The shooter should NEVER know precisely when the gun will fire, but should press the trigger with steadily increasing force while concentrating on keeping the sights aligned with the target. When the gun discharges it should come as a surprise. The shooter should hold his breath during this exercise to prevent excessive barrel wobble.\nThat is basically all there is to shooting. Assuming the sights are in proper alignment with the target and the barrel is held steady and the firing distance is reasonable, the shooter who follows these simple instructions will hit hi s intended target.\nLEN BOOK MEDICAL SUPPLIES:**\nMost survival manuals put a great deal of emphasis on herbal medicines and with good reasons. There are virtually thousands of wild plants, trees and shrubs that have proven medicinal value. The major drawback to herbal medicine is that the woodsman needs to posses a great deal of knowledge to prepare and use them properly. In most instance it is safer and easier to carry a broad supply of modern medicine. However for everyone's convenience we have included some ways to prepare and use those medicinal herbs.\nASPIRIN:\nIt is an inexpensive yet fairly effective pain killer. It will help you ease the swelling in an injured or bruised limb, bring back down a fever & dampen the pain of minor injuries. Aspirin also works to thin blood and so MUST NOT be used when internal bleeding is suspected.\nIBUPROFEN TABLETS:\nThey are available under a number of brand names, including the original medical name, Motrin. They are very effective against pain. Four of the over the counter tablets are equal to one prescription strength Motrin tablet. Except for possible stomach upset ALWAYS a potential side effect of Motrin, taking 4 Ibuprofen will not harm the user. However, use this dosage only in cases of very severe pain, NEVER exceed it and do not repeat it more often than once every 4 hours.\nREMEMBER, pain is the body's signal that something is wrong. NEVER use a pain killer to make it possible to walk on an injured leg or to overcome a suspected back injury. Doing so will only make matters worse. It is better to be laid up for a couple of days with a minor injury than for a couple of weeks with an injury compounded by foolishness.\nBAR OF SOAP:\nIt should ALWAYS be part of any wilderness first-aid kit. Doctors now agree that the best way to prevent infection in minor cuts and scrapes is not with peroxide, alcohol, mercurochrome or any of the other popular disinfectants but simply to wash the wound with soap and water. (MAKE SURE that the water is germ free by either boiling it or adding purifying substances.) My advice however is that you should use non-scented soap (ex: Sunlight bars), the reason because scented soap attracts mosquitoes etc.\nANTIBIOTIC OINTMENTS:\nSuch as Neosporin are also NECESSARY to a functional first-aid kit. These ointments take up where the soap and water leave off, providing a protective coating that keeps bacteria out of a wound as well as antibiotics to kill any germs that might still be there after the washing. Most antibiotics ointments also contain zinc oxide to accelerate healing.\nIODINE:\nIt is not necessary to disinfect cuts, but it is a good idea to include a bottle of it in your kit. It will disinfect wounds, (although it destroys skin cells in the process) but it's most important as a water purifier. WARNING: VERY POISONOUS! 2 or 3 drops in a quart canteen will kill any virus, bacteria or trematode living in it. Iodine is also highly poisonous to humans! NEVER exceed 3 drops per quart of water and ALWAYS MAKE CERTAIN that some of the water is sloshed over the mouth of the canteen before drinking from it. Commercially made iodine water purification tablets are available from most stores that sell camping equipment, but are 2 or 3 times more expensive than a bottle of ordinary iodine disinfectant and tend to disintegrate over time.\nBUTTERFLY SUTURES:\nThey are a relatively new innovation that have found wide acceptance among outdoorsmen who do not have quick access to medical help but may need to close gaping wounds quickly before serious blood loss can occur. In days past, the only recourse was to stitch the wound closed with a needle and some type of thread. This is not recommended in the less than sterile environment of the wilderness because the needle and thread often introduce new infectious organisms that can breed in the closed wound. Nearly as effective as stitches, butterfly sutures are essentially very sticky tapes enclosed in a sterile envelope. After thoroughly washing the wound and stopping the bleeding as much as possible, the butterfly suture is used to pull the wound closed and hold it there.\nSAFETY TAPE: Duct tape\nA fairly new item that was originally designed to wrap the fingers of factory workers to prevent minor cuts and scratches. The tape is made by applying a latex coating over surgical grade cotton gauze and wrapping it in roll form. It will stick tenaciously to itself but will not adhere to anything else including skin.\nSince most cuts sustained by woodsmen are on the fingers, safety tape is perfect for bandaging even serious wounds on the digits quickly and with almost no blood loss. After washing the wound thoroughly, apply a generous coating of an antibiotic ointment and wrap the finger with several snug (not tight) layers of safety tape. This will close the wound. Leave the tape on for a least 12 hours before carefully removing it to apply a looser wrap over a fresh coating of antibiotic ointment. Safety tape is also useful for wrapping sprained joints and applying splints to broken bones. It comes in a variety of widths up to 3 inches & an assortment of colors, although only white should be used as a bandage.\nAt the time of this writing there is only one source for safety tape that we are aware of. The company is General Bandages Inc. Box 99 Morton Grove Illinois 60053 USA. A free roll is available from them for the asking.\nMULTIVITAMIN TABLETS:\nThey are on often overlooked item of the well-equipped first-aid kit. It is ironic that so many of the folks who religiously take vitamins at home will forget them in the woods. In a survival situation a good multivitamin can help to stave off the effects of malnutrition by providing the vitamins & minerals necessary to remain healthy and energetic. ** see Spectrum 29\nTOOTHBRUSH:\nIt is another vital accessory that many woodsmen even trained survivalists tend to forget. A gum infection can set in quickly in the woods and can become an abscess without proper dental hygiene. A tooth abscess can virtually kill its victim overnight with a fever that can easily top the 100 degree mark. Toothpaste is optional (salt is a good one), but no woodsman should ever be without a toothbrush.\nIn a pinch the twig brush, an old fashioned cleaner that precedes the modern toothbrush will suffice. The twig brush is made by chewing a section of green twig (we recommend the witch hazel shrub) until the end is frayed and fibrous. Care should be taken to avoid twigs from poisonous shrubs like Dogwood **. Maple, oak, poplar, birch, beech and even pine can be safely used to make a twig brush.\nPRESCRIPTION DRUGS:\nFor those going into very remote place these drugs can be a real asset. Penicillin, xylocaine, light prescription pain killers can sometimes be obtained by scheduling an appointment with the family doctor. Any doctor worth his salt will question your motives at length before consenting to write a prescription and will probably have a good bit of advice to offer concerning the use of prescription drugs in the wilderness.\nListen carefully to this advice and take notes; it may save your life in an emergency. Most doctors will also ask that you return any unused drugs when you come back. A well-stocked emergency medical kit can be invaluable in a survival situation and may even save your life. It need not be large or heavy but it MUST be as functional and efficient as possible.\nAdequate medical kits can be made from small duffels, lunch boxes or even zip-lock plastic bag or even several ordinary hinged bar-soap containers filled with an assortment of small items and held closed by heavy rubber bands.\nA LIST OF ITEMS:\n1 tube antibiotic ointment., 1 roll 1\" wide safety tape., Butterfly sutures, assorted sizes., 1 bottle Ibuprofen tablets., 1 bottle of aspirin /1 bottle of iodine, 1 small bar hand soap. / 1 toothbrush, 1 pair of tweezers / 1 small pair scissors, 6 alcohol prep pads/ 1 toenail clippers., 1 section latex rubber tubing, 2 feet long, for tourniquet (or 2 feet long Velcro strip), 1 bottle of multivitamins / 1 roll cotton gauze, 1 package sewing needle, assorted sizes, 1 styptic pencil. 1 mini-first-aid book.\nMISCELLANEOUS ITEMS:\nOnly size and weight limit the utility of any survival kit. Although most experts highly urge anyone not to go over 40 lb. as a maximum. Of course the size and complexity of a deer hunter's survival kit will be less than that of a boater or off-road driver.\nThe aforementioned items are those that have been proven useful many times and all of them are recommended for inclusion in any survivalist's kit. The following items are also very useful, but probably none of them are critical to survival. Of course, whether or not a particular item is necessary or not depends on the season, terrain, individual wants and a host of other factors.\nSLINGSHOTS:\nMost of us had slingshots as children. Those of us who are older than we care to admit probably made ours from rubber inner tubes and a Y-shaped stick. They were effective, but not nearly as powerful as the latest generation of high-velocity slingshots powered by tough latex rubber tubing. Using marbles or ball bearings as ammo, this new breed of slingshots is easily capable of taking most small game animals, providing the hunter has enough skills to hit them. Some models even fold into a compact unit for easy storage in a backpack.\nSPARE SOCKS:\nThey are very important in cold weather. The best one all around are wool ones. Wet socks do little to keep feet warm and wearing wet socks in cold weather can result in trench-foot, frozen toes even gangrene. The military has long realized the importance of clean, dry socks in cold weather, especially under conditions of prolonged exposure.\nLEATHER GLOVES:\nAnother important item to anyone in any weather. During warm weather a pair of heavy leather gloves will protect the hands from scratches, cuts, blisters and burns. In cold weather with a pair of wool liners inside, they will like-wise protect them from frostbite and cold. G-I issue gloves are adequate for all around use but the leather used to make them is not as heavy as that used in some of the civilian models, most notably those from Well-Lamont company. Ironically the less durable military gloves sell at twice the price of civilian work gloves. (Go figure?!)\nWIDE HAT:\nThe wide-brimmed military type bush hat is more versatile than many folks realize. It offers nothing in the way of warmth during cold weather, but when it is warm the bush hat will help to keep the sun off the wearer's head and out of his eyes. Being made of heavy cloth it can be saturated with water and worn wet to keep the head cool, yet still retain enough water repellence to keep a pouring rain out of your eyes. Many have used theirs to filter mud, silt, and microscopic organisms from swamp water, even as berry bucket or pot-holder for campfire cooking or even as trap to catch minnows for use as bait. For the hunter this rumpled, misshapen appearance of the bush hat works to make him less recognizable in almost any terrain.\nDEW RAG: (VERY USEFUL & MANY USES)\nUsed by Special Forces in Vietnam; it is nothing more than a very large handkerchief or square of heavy cloth preferably flannel or jersey and measuring 3 to 4 feet across. It can be used to filter muddy water, as an emergency tourniquet, arm-sling, as pot-holder, tied at the 4 corners to make a hobo bindle, as a sweatband, or a wash-cloth. In desert area it can be used to sponge up the dewdrops that collect on rock in the early morning. The gathered dew can then be wrung out into a canteen cup, tin can or directly into the mouth.\nWIRE TIES:\nLarge, colored wire ties, like those included with some brands of plastic bag are infinitely useful in the wild. They can be used to quickly fasten together the frame of an emergency shelter or bundle of dry grasses into an insulated sleeping mat. Or they can be used one per pair of eyelet's, to replace a boot-lace that has been sacrificed to make a snare or hunting bow. They will even serve to fasten branches, ferns, and leafy boughs to one's clothing as hunting camouflage.\nELECTRONIC & SURVIVAL:\nBesides the **Panasonic tracker, the electronics of today is so compact and energy efficient that there is no reason whatsoever not to have a radio receiver on any venture away from civilization. Personal AM/FM receivers are smaller than a deck of cards and can operate on 2 AAA alkaline cells for a week or more. One of the best backpack radio would be one that receives AM, FM, VHF-TV & Weather Band frequencies. They cost less than $20.00 and will operate on 4 AA batteries for a month when used for about 3 hours each day.\nA good radio receiver can be most important for maintaining the morale of a stranded woodsman by constantly reminding him that civilization still exists. The receiver is also valuable for the weather reports it provides, especially if it has Weather Band capability.\nSEWING KIT:\nA sewing kit can be valuable not only to the survivalist but also to the recreational woodsman who is neither lost nor stranded. Clothing tears, ripped backpack seams, and a variety of other frequent damage that can be repaired only by needle and thread are common to wilderness travel. A very workable kit can be made by placing a small spoon of thread and a package of assorted sewing needles in a 35mm film bottle. The total cost of this type of kit is less than $1.00.\nOTHER NEAR ESSENTIAL ITEMS: (LBE)\nWe highly recommend that any woodsman have with him a G-I type plastic canteen, canteen cup, canteen cover and nylon pistol belt. This heavy grommeted pistol belt is a handy place to carry a survival knife, medical kit, pouches and nearly all the smaller component of a practical survival kit.\nOne of the best harness is the US Army LBE (Load bearing equipment) harness which is basically just a pistol belt with heavy canvass suspenders attached. This belt should be worn with a heavy canvass suspender, otherwise it will slip off you too easily. It provides you with the most efficient and comfortable method of carrying other survival equipment that we have found.\nI have a razor-sharp USAF survival knife taped securely to the left shoulder strap (I am right-handed) in the upside down position for quick and easy access. (No I am no Rambo) I also have 2 ammo pouches attached to the belt that contain fishing tackle, matches, sewing kit, medical gear, Trioxane bars, .22 ammunition and an assortment of other items too numerous to list. Also attached to the belt is a small map pouch that contains a Silva map compass, a stainless steel mirror (All purpose blade see**) and a laminated waterproof map of the area I intend to be traveling. Occasionally I carry 2 canteens and still have plenty of room to attach extra pouches, a machete or hatchet and just about anything else that can be feasibly attached to the belt or suspenders.\nThis LBE outfit is a completely self-contained survival kit that wears comfortably and weighs less than 15 pounds with 2 full canteens.\nINSECT REPELLENT:\nThe importance of a good insect repellent depends on the terrain and the weather. In the snow or desert it has little value, but if you are traveling through h or near a swampy area in warm weather, an effective insect repellent is worth its weight in gold. Mosquitoes are usually the least of your worries; more important are the 300 species of horsefly and deerfly and the 600 species of blackflies. These parasitic flies are all very determined biters and all potentially dangerous to humans.\nDeerflies and horseflies both inflict bites that are quite painful, often bleed freely and swell into large wheals that can itch intensely for several days. (Ouch!!!) These 2 flies are credited with the ability to remove up to a pint and half of blood from a domestic animal in a single day. A human without protection in areas of heavily infestation could be in real danger.\nBlackflies also pose a danger to the unprepared. Their bite is painless but ALWAYS bleeds freely and is followed by dime size wheal that itches intensely for several days. This fly has been known to kill thousands of animals in a single season and humans exposed to area of heavy blackfly infestation have in many cases required hospitalization.\nAll 3 of these flies have a proven ability to transmit a variety sometimes fatal diseases, including tularemia. Less noticeable ticks and chiggers also transmit a variety of diseases, most notably Lyme disease.\nThere are a number of wild plants that can be used as an effective insect repellent (specially catnip, cedar, and other mints), but few are as effective as a single bottle of repellent containing DEET stashed in the survival kit. We do not recommend aerosol spray because it is bad for the ozone layer besides taking too much room in your kit. A small bottle of Muskol brand repellent contains 100% DEET and will last for weeks in the wild. In the absence of insect repellent, the survivalist can protect himself by covering his face, hands and other exposed areas with a layer of mud.\nClothing should be buttoned as snugly as possible around the wrists and neck and trousers' legs should be bloused or tied securely around the ankles. Small, smoky \"smudges\" fires can be set around the perimeter of the camp to deter mosquitoes after dark and help the survivalist get a good night's sleep.\nSMUDGE FIRES:\nSmudges fires are made by building a small hot fire and then partially smothering it with wet leaves, grass or pine needles. With a good bed of coals a smudge fire will smolder for several hours and produce enough smoke to repel biting insects.\nRECOMMENDED ITEMS FOR SURVIVAL KIT:\nNo survival kit will provide for every contingency in every environment, but the following are pretty much generic to all conditions. Any working survival kit should contain each of these, although those that have been recommended by name are offered merely as suggestions and are subject to personal preference.\nSurvival Knife, Shrade M7-S or USAF survival knife, Compass, Silva Type 3 / This survival book, Matches, wooden, waterproof, strike anywhere\" type. Butane lighter (I recommend 4), 2 on you at all times and 2 in your survival kit., Fishing kit (in 35mm film canister) , Space-blanket or large plastic tarp, Nylon cord 100 feet, 1 blade survival knife **see? for inf., Flashlight, AA Mini Mag-lite (batteries & bulbs), Signal flares, gun or pencil type with launcher, Fire starting tables, Trioxane or Hexamine, Candles (at least 2), Canteen, with metal cup, cover and belt (LBE), Spare socks, 1 pair, wool is best., Radio receiver, AM-FM with Weather Band, (Or and with a Panasonic tracker**), Medical supplies (see***) Poncho / sunglasses\nOPTIONAL ITEMS FOR SURVIVAL KIT:\n.22 rifle, Charter Arms AR-7 or Marlin 70-P, .22 ammo's, 100 rounds Remington Viper, Slingshot, latex tubing type, Gloves, leather & wool ones, Bush hat / Wire ties / Dog rag / Sewing kit, Insect repellent, bottle, 100% DEET, Spearhead, frog 3-tined, Prescription drugs (xylocaine, penicillin), Here could go either an addition to it or a 3rd class of items ex: soap, toothbrush, sponge, toilet paper, food / etc.\nWHAT DO I DO FIRST?:\nIt is safe to say that anyone who suddenly finds himself thrust into a do-or-die survival situation will not be in a clear state of mind. This will be particularly true if he has been injured. Panic is the mortal enemy of anyone in a survival situation. It can and does cause people to do things that are counter-productive to their survival, even to the point of being suicidal. Since panic is a non-cerebral function, it can be most effectively controlled by maintaining a logical approach to the task of staying alive.\nTHE FIRST THING THE SURVIVALIST MUST DO IS MAKE HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.\nThe critical thinking portion of the mind is seriously hampered by physical discomfort, so the survivalist needs to address the requirement of his body before attempting to devise an escape plan. He should apply first aid to any injuries, take an analgesic if in pain, build a fire to warm himself or find or construct a shelter if the weather is bad.\nOnce he has established a base camp and made himself as comfortable as possible, the survivalist can then take stock of both his supplies and his situation. Assuming that he has with him a well-equipped survival kit and that each of its components has withstood the ordeal up to that point. He can use map if he has one and his compass to determine his approximate location, learn what obstacle lies between himself and civilization, and plot the most direct route back home. If he has a working radio receiver, he should use it, not only to gather weather reports and forecasts, but also entertainment.\nProper attitude is also a vital part of the survival process. The way one perceives his situation is at least as important as his knowledge and skill. A successful survivalist is NEVER lost, only momentarily perplex. He may wonder when he will get home, but NEVER if he will get home. In most cases, the survivalist's best option will be to walk back to civilization. Before starting the trek, MAKE CERTAIN that you have a good idea of where you are headed as possible. Travel as lightly as you can, but not to the point of leaving behind transportable tools that might have critical importance on the trail. If package food is available, it should make up most of the weight carried because the pack will become lighter as the food is eaten, and REMEMBER, there is absolutely nothing to prevent you from taking as many rest periods as you feel are necessary.\nForced march has no application in real life and is in fact counterproductive. NEVER push yourself to the point of exhaustion because a tired mind and body are apt to make dangerous even deadly mistakes. Based on our experience, a cold, tired survivalist who continues to push on after his body tells him to stop will become irritable and jumpy and may go right over the edge into a blind panic. IN A NUTSHELL, ONE OF THE BIG SECRET TO SURVIVAL IS TO BE KIND TO YOURSELF. If you are cold, build a fire, if you are hungry, eat; and if you are tired, rest. Believe in yourself and NEVER doubt your own capabilities.\nAll of us are born with inherent powerful survival instinct. That, a few basic pieces of equipment, and a little bit of knowledge are all that will be required to emerge alive and healthy from the most challenging wilderness survival situation. Believe it!\nBEST CLOTHING = WOOL: BEST WOOL IS FROM RABBIT FUR. MOST SURVIVAL SPECIALIST AGREE THAT THE BEST CLOTHING FOR RETAINING BODY HEAT IN WET WEATHER IS MADE FROM WOOL!\nGortex will help to keep you dry. Thinsulate Will keep you warm, when you are dry, but ONLY WOOL will keep you warm when you are soaking wet.** (Eve-n- Soak- King wet!)\nSURVIVAL RATION BOX: *\nSufficient ration of carbohydrates under all latitudes assuring to the survivor about 500 calories/day. THIS RATION BOX HAS BEEN TESTED BY & FOR THE ARMY THUS GOOD FOR CIVILIANS CONTAINING THE MAXIMUM OF UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS FOR SURVIVAL. It is called: \"BEST UNIVERSAL RATION\" because it contains the best nutritive elements that CAN BE EATEN with or without water and yet giving enough energy to keep the body alive without complications. IF one doesn't use too much energy. 1 gram of protein (with water) gives about: 400 calories / 1 gram of fat = 800 calories / 1 gram carbohydrates with water = 400 calories. This ration MUST be eaten as instructed for best result. For the first day, if the survivor does not eat, he will draw his energy in his own fat reserves coming from the food he ate the day before.\nWORK SPECIAL NOTE:\nThus it is recommended to do the most physical work such as shelter construction, find and gathering fuel for fire, the placing of signalization devices etc. as much as possible on the first day when the survivor still has the maximum energy. This survival ration is mainly composed of carbohydrates but contains enough fat to gear the production of stomach acids which will neutralize the stomach contraction which gives hunger feelings. It is next to impossible to starve in a wilderness if one knows how to look for, if no game, look for fish, mollusk, birds, plants, roots etc.\nFOOD TO BRING:\nOne MUST consider the weight and its nutritive and energetic value in calories. The energy is measure in calories. A person in good health spends easily 4,000 calories per day. So 1 kilo of food MUST supply 400 calories per 100 grams of food in order to make up for the loss. Only oils & dry food contains as much. The food MUST also contain 10% of protein (P) to help maintain the skin tissues and at least 20% lipids (L) to increase the resistance of the organism and as for the #Glucides# (G). See** end of this chapter. They give energy which if not used right away will be transformed in fat which is not a problem for the men in the wild since fat is beautiful even Vital. (Calories = Cal)\nIn the following list** those who have less than 25 % are in brackets. Spices are not included since their food value is low but they have their value as to the taste buds and the moral. Dry food sold in store is excellent, light, nourishing but costly. So dry it yourself with the new invention from USA a drying machine more on this to get information ****\nRATIONS WISDOM:\nONE COULD LIVE MANY MONTHS WITH ONLY 4 ELEMENTS.\nPowder milk, oil, enriched cereal and poly-vitamins capsules. I would personally add: Spirolina, peanuts, barley, salt, sugar. As well as fat, Pemmican and Pinhole, Gorp, Rockomini. ** See #? *** for recipe.\nFOOD PACK SURVIVAL 4lbs: *\n1 lb. of Pemmican, 1 lb. of Pinhole, 1lb. salted peanuts, 1lb. Of Pinhole or Gorp.\nSURVIVAL RATIONS: *\nFat which in calories is the most concentrated food is the sustenance most difficult to come by when living off the land.\nButter, lard, bacon dripping, tallow, oleomargarine has more than twice as many calories pound for pound than sugar & nearly 3 times as much as honey.\nTherefore in survival conditions include a preponderance or priorities of EDIBLE fats with the idea of completing the diet from natural sources. Since bears eat insects such as larva, grubs; it maybe that the best way to get your fat would be to do the same, meaning use the insects to get your fat of the land if no other means available.\nALL SEEDS IN CONES RICH IN FAT, AND PROTEIN: ***\n(Find all seeds and roots which are rich in fat and protein and have them first in the list of survival plants..)\nBODY COOKING! REMEMBER: ONCE YOUR FEET ARE WARMED UP WE FEEL WARMER ALL OVER & NOTHING IS WARMER THAN 2 PAIRS OF SOCKS. (Wool is best of all.)

The stuff you listed weighs a lot more than 25-30 lbs.\n2. You MUST be able to carry each and every item of kit in your back-pack or on your person. You CAN NOT depend on someone else to take care of it for you.\n3. You must bring clothing for every season of the year. The actual items of clothing would be different, depending on where in the US you live. But you must bring it all. And you MUST always bring two pairs of boots. Preferably one pair of all leather boots (Gore-Tex if you can afford it) and one pair of cooler boots.\n4. If you carry a civilian rifle make sure that it has a fiberglass or carbon fiber stock, preferably of a thumb-hole design. A civilian wooden stock will break.\n5. Bring a knife with a longer blade than 6\". It should be 7\" or more. The Ka-Bar USMC knife, or the new SOG Seal Team 2000 would be fine. Especially the latter (which is what I use nowadays). You need three knives, just as you listed, a 7-8\" blade one, a 5\" folder (folding hunter or Spyderco Clipit Endura) and a Swiss Army type.\n6. You must carry a light weight camping stove. The Coleman Peak 1 range is good (especially the Feather 442 that burns ordinary unleaded gas). You must also carry pots and a small frying pan. Aluminum, not stainless steel. And remember, you must be able to survive on your own so you must carry all the food you need for at least 2-3 days. And BTW forget the Army-type mess kit, it's too heavy. Get something light weight.\n7. You need a lightweight sleeping bag. And what the British call a \"bivy-bag\" to use instead of a tent. If you want to fight like the Rangers you must be able to live like the Rangers.\n8. Get a GOOD compass. Some of the Swedish-made Silvas are among the best you can get at any price. And MAPS of the area where you intend to operate.\n9. First aid kit.\n10. You need a lot more than 60 rounds of ammo. Be prepared to carry 180 rounds or more just for yourself, for starters. Plus your share of whatever is needed for support weapons like MG's and the like. If you can get hold of a couple of Carl Gustav AT Recoilless Rifles, with an ample supply of high-explosive and HEAT rounds, then that would come in handy. They're the best. Get the version with the carbon-fiber reinforced tube, it weighs less than the all-steel tube. A few AT-4's could be a substitute, but then you wouldn't have the HE capability.\n11. And before you do anything get the following books and memorize what's in them:\na) US Army Ranger Handbook (ST 21-75-2)\nb) An infantryman's guide to urban combat (FM 90-10-1)\nc) USMC Sniping (Available as ISBN 0-87947-420-3, published by Desert Publications, Cornville, AZ)\n12. And finally, make sure that you are able to carry it all for extended periods of time. Say 25 miles a day for a number of days in a row. And I'm not kidding, you'll need that if you want to fight like Rangers, which is what you would have to do in order to survive. If you're in good shape you can do it. I have personally taken part in the International 100-mile Marches in Nijmegen, Holland, two years in a row. There you do 25 miles a day for four consecutive days, with a pack, marching at good speed. (Some 8,000 military personnel from up to 20 different countries, including some 500 US Army and USAF, take part every year).\nAdd:\nAntibiotics. If you visit the doctor and get any, save some. They usually give you more than you need anyhow.\nBinoculars/ field glasses.\nGas mask with filter(s).\nBandages (large-small), cotton roll, water-proof tape, cotton swabs/q-tips. and other assorted goodies. Everyone should carry some medical supplies.\nYou need a good watch. It should be water proof, have a timer and night light. Mine is a \"Timex Expedition\" with features: compass ring, analog and digital display, two timezones, two alarms, timer, stopwatch, night light.\nBed roll.. optional of course.\nBy the way a superb battery is RAYOVAC MAXIMUM ALKALINE. They seem to last forever in storage or in use. No joke... I've had two in one flashlight for a year now.. they are still going strong (and I do use this light for hours at a time on occasion.) And before being put in the flashlight they were in storage for TWO YEARS. Check em' out. Stay away from Ni-Cad rechargeables!\nBasic Survival Equipment By Michael Ironwolf\nIn any survival situation, the basic needs of food, water and shelter must be met as well as personal protection from those attempting to appropriate YOUR food, water and shelter. We should expect an increase in the number of individuals interested in survival. In addition, after observing the lawlessness that occurred in St. Croix what with the military HELPING the looters, we should also expect some \"SOFT Survivalists\" (NO GUNS) to become \"Hard Survivalists\" (LOTS OF GUNS). Please welcome them into our ranks. (They didn't know any better). This basic list of individual equipment will give anyone, veteran or newbie, a place to start obtaining the hardware they will need in the very near future.\nThe following list of equipment should be considered a BASIC load and will continue to be improved as finances permit. Ideally, your \"Bug Out Bag\" is utilized to provide for your needs enroute to your retreat site or if relocation is necessary due to pursuit by an invading army or secret police. Your personal equipment demands the best that money can buy. In almost every case this is government issue or contract overrun produced equipment. Take advantage of the millions of dollars of R & D the government has done and buy things that will literally last decades if properly maintained.\nMandatory Basic Equipment Survey Checklist\n3 Bag, Duffle, G.I., Nylon, Type II, O.D., 1 Belt, Pistol, Nylon, LC-2, O.D., 1 Harness, LBE \"Y\" or \"H\", Nylon, O.D., 2 Cover, Canteen, Nylon, O.D., 1 qt., 1 Cup, Canteen, Steel, 1 qt., 2 Canteen, Plastic, O.D., 1 qt., 3 Opener, Can, P-38, Steel or Aluminum, 1 Utensil, Eating, Knife/Fork/Spoon, 1 Kit, Mess, G.I., Steel or Aluminum, 3 Matches, Waterproof/Windproof, Survival, Boat, 2 Knife, Combat, U.S.M.C.

The ammunition requirements are BARE MINIMUM. Should you be forced to defend yourself, you and your team could eat up a case of 1000 rounds in 6 or 7 MINUTES! Stock up now !\n2. Always purchase surplus used excellent/very good or contract production overruns. DO NOT BUY overseas imports (except for Korean Jungle Boots...OK) or reproductions. You NEED the tough mil spec construction/materials.\n3. Your sleeping bag should ALWAYS be synthetic (holofil) or equivalent. DO NOT USE GOOSE DOWN. It gets wet, you freeze. You freeze, You die.\n4. Water purification tablets should be IODINE based. Chlorine based tablets do not kill giardia parasites.\n5. Use an unscented soap like ivory. Its cheap, keeps for a long time and is a good CATFISH BAIT for fishing. In addition, heavy perfume scents can be detected by animals in the bush (2 & 4 footed animals)\n6. Don't be afraid to take advantage of the new fabrics to make like more comfortable. Gortex (waterproof), Thermax (warmth) and Kevlar (antiballistic) are very useful. In addition, use of silicone waterproofing spray on cammies, boots, packs and sleeping bags is recommended.\n7. When packing your kit ALWAYS distribute the weight evenly. Remember that someone besides an adult male (wife, children) may be forced to \"get started\" without you.\n8. The construction of your \"Bug Out Bag\" is a personal project and should reflect your personal needs. It is not a good idea to buy a cute little prepackaged \"survival bag\", set it in the closet and forget it. Remember that 35-40% of the cost of that product is \"profit\" to the dealer. Good equipment at good prices can be had at small surplus stores, gun shows and even better deals can be had by mail order.\nYour Family Disaster Supplies Kit - FEMA\nAfter a disaster, local officials and relief workers will be on the scene, but they cannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in hours, or it may take days. Would your family be prepared to cope with the emergency until help arrives?\nYour family will cope best by preparing for disaster before it strikes. One way to prepare is by assembling a Disaster Supplies Kit. Once disaster hits, you won't have time to shop or search for supplies. But if you've gathered supplies in advance, your family can endure an evacuation or home confinement.\nTo prepare your kit\nReview the checklists in this document. Gather the supplies that are listed. You may need them if your family is confined at home. Place the supplies you'd most likely need for an evacuation in an easy-to-carry container. These supplies are listed with an asterisk (*). Disasters happen anytime and anywhere. And when disaster strikes, you may not have much time to respond. A highway spill of hazardous material could mean instant evacuation. A winter storm could confine your family at home. An earthquake, flood, tornado or any other disaster could cut off basic services--gas, water, electricity and telephones--for days.\nWater\nStore water in plastic containers such as soft drink bottles. Avoid using containers that will decompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts of water each day. Hot environments and intense physical activity can double that amount. Children, nursing mothers and ill people will need more. Store one gallon of water per person per day (two quarts for drinking, two quarts for food preparation/sanitation)* Keep at least a three-day supply of water for each person in your household.\nFood\nStore at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food. Select foods that require no refrigeration, preparation or cooking and little or no water. If you must heat food, pack a can of sterno. Select food items that are compact and lightweight. *Include a selection of the following foods in your Disaster Supplies Kit:\nReady-to-eat canned meats, fruits and vegetables, Canned juices, milk, soup (if powdered, store extra water), Staples--sugar, salt, pepper, High energy foods--peanut butter, jelly, crackers, granola bars, trail mix, Vitamins, Foods for infants, elderly persons or persons on special diets, Comfort/stress foods--cookies, hard candy, sweetened cereals, lollipops, instant coffee, tea bags\nFirst Aid Kit\nAssemble a first aid kit for your home and one for each car. A first aid kit* should include:\n- Sterile adhesive bandages in assorted sizes\n- 2-inch sterile gauze pads (4-6)\n- 4-inch sterile gauze pads (4-6)\n- Hypoallergenic adhesive tape\n- 2-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls)\n- 3-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls)\n- Scissors\n"}, {"score": 325.5061, "uuid": "ce9f73e4-e3d0-5c98-bc0d-2e87b37850a0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0704wb-78-27611", "target_hostname": "www.ultimate-weight-products.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ultimate-weight-products.com/blog/", "page_rank": 2.65681e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Ultimate Nourishment", "snippet": "Sauerkraut Recipe - for use with a 10L Harsch fermentation <em>pot</em> approx. 5-8 g <em>of</em> salt for 1 kg cabbage (The <em>better</em> the <em>pot</em> <em>is</em> sealed the less salt <em>is</em> required.)", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted in Healthy Living , Raw & Living Foods | No Comments \u00bb\nLactic fermentation is one of the oldest methods of food preservation. It has been used around the world as a method of food preservation and as an essential addition to a healthy diet. The lactic acid bacteria that ferments vegetables has a pleasant acidic taste and a rich content of vitamins and minerals. Sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), for example, has a very high vitamin C level, and has long been touted for it\u2019s health giving properties.\nAlong with the increased vitamin and mineral content of lactic fermented foods, they also include the fiber of the vegetable for maintaining a healthy digestion and lowering cholesterol. The lactic bacteria present is important for the build-up and maintenance of healthy intestinal flora. Other secondary plant substances can help the body to prevent cancer, and prevent the body against infection, and inhibit the growth and reproduction of fungi. Many fermented vegetables also contain anti-ulcer properties that protect the stomach against and help prevent intestinal ulcers.\u00a0 Acetylcholine is also present in sauerkraut and other fermented vegetables which has natural anti-depressant properties.\nLactic Fermentation is the only one that preserves all the natural substances of the vegetable. It also allows the flavor to fully develop, thereby, preserving the food, and improving its quality. As a nutritionist, I highly recommend consuming this type of fermented vegetable at least once day.\nThe best method of lactic fermentation is made traditionally, in old-world style stoneware fermentation pots. The patented original Harsch stoneware fermentation pots are hand-crafted, baked at 1200 degrees Celsius and are suitable for fermenting almost all kinds vegetables such as cabbage, pumpkins, cucumbers, carrots, beans, celery, onions, and bell peppers. Theses pots are the superior method of fermentation for three main reasons. First, because they are made of\u00a0 natural stoneware the environment they create is mold and slime free, whereas other pots made of glass or other substances are more porous and can allow for the development of mold. Additionally, the the Harsch fermentation pots contain a water groove around the rim of the pot which as long as the groove is always filled with water will prevent air from penetrating into the crockery pot, the formation of film-forming yeast which makes the vegetables slimy, the top layer of vegetables from perishing, dust or bugs from coming in, and the weighing stone from becoming greasy. And finally the Harsch fermentation pots include a two-piece weighing stone that ensure the vegetables are always covered in liquid and generates the correct pressure required for lactic fermentation to take place.\nSauerkraut Recipe - for use with a 10L Harsch fermentation pot\napprox. 5-8 kg of cabbage\napprox. 5-8 g of salt for 1 kg cabbage (The better the pot is sealed the less salt is required.)\n1. Remove the outer wilted leaves of the cabbage and the stalk (either with a special cutter or a knife) and shred the cabbage into a large dish.\n2. Weigh the salt and place it next to the cabbage.\n3. Put one layer of shredded cabbage into the stoneware fermentation pot, add some salt and press down firmly (with your fist or with a stamper) until juice (cell sap) emerges.\n4. Repeat the above procedure until the pot is full.\n5. Place the weighing stone on top. If there is less than 3-4 cm of juice above the stone, add some boiled and cooled salt water (15 g of salt for 1 L of water).\n6. Close pot with the lid and pour some water in the groove.\n7. Leave the pot at room temperature (20-22 degrees C) for 2-3 at best in the kitchen. When you hear the bubbling sound the fermentation process has started.\n8. Put the pot in a cool place (approx. 15-18 degrees C).\n9. After 4-6 weeks you can eat the sauerkraut. Store in a cool cellar (5-15 degrees C).\nShare and Enjoy:\n"}, {"score": 325.04773, "uuid": "ca56807a-61ab-5487-b080-8894203bff96", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-18-26114", "target_hostname": "www.lib.uwo.ca", "target_uri": "https://www.lib.uwo.ca/blogs/education/the-librarian-is-reading/", "page_rank": 1.8006585e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Education Library Blog: The Librarian <em>is</em> reading...

Any writer worth his salt improves the story until it is worth telling'), Kington's mischievous wit never falters: 'I'm afraid this wasn't an idea for a book after all, only an idea on how to spend the royalties...' Wry, poignant and deeply moving, these letters are above all very, very funny. Every word is vintage Kington.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on January 20, 2010 9:46 AM\nA Buddhist in the Classroom by Sid Brown\nA Buddhist perspective on classroom teaching.\nBack cover summary of the book:\nSid Brown brings a Buddhist perspective into the classroom to explore the ethical quandaries, lived experiences, and intimacy of teaching. Addressing such topics as attention, community, rage, wonder, consumerism, and simple kindness, Brown demonstrates how this centuries-old tradition can inform and enrich classroom life.\nReaders do not have to be Buddhists to appreciate the gifts of this tradition and Brown's fresh perspective on education. Stories from Buddhist texts offer illustrative teaching moments, and an archive of practical tools and suggestions make this book a valuable reference. While Brown teaches at the college level, teachers of students at all levels and those who are interested in the educational experience will gain insight from this book.\nAbout the Author:\nSid Brown is Associate Professor of Religion at Sewanee: The University of the South and the author of The Journey of One Buddhist Nun: Even Against the Wind.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on January 13, 2010 10:24 AM\nPackaging Girlhood: Rescuing Our Daughters from Marketers' Schemes by Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown\n\"That girls are overwhelmed by images of princesses, demure femininity and pink, pink, pink is no surprise.\nWhat is shocking, as Lamb (The Secret Lives of Girls) and Brown (Meeting at the Crossroads) so astutely demonstrate, is the downright bombardment girls receive, coming from all forms of media.\nLamb and Brown, both psychologists, came to harsh conclusions after they surveyed girls; sat through hours of Rugrats and Kim Possible television programming; scoured stores such as Hot Topic and Claire's; watched Hilary Duff movies; listened to Eminem and Beyonc\u00e9; visited MySpace.com; and read Caldecott books.\nThe idea of \"girl power was snapped up by the media,\" and \"what it sells is an image of being empowered,\" argue the authors. Girls are offered two choices by the marketers: they are \"either for the boys or one of the boys.\"\nEven rebellion is being packaged, \"the resistance, that edginess and irreverence that once gave girls a pathway out of the magic kingdom.\"\nThe book is incredibly readable and rises above others in the genre by giving parents (and teachers) concrete tools to help battle stereotypes.\nLamb and Brown include lists of books and movies with positive role models and talking points to help your daughter recognize how she is being manipulated.\nThe authors aren't trying to deny anyone princesses or pink; they just want girls to be knowledgeable enough to choose what will truly interest them.\"\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on January 12, 2010 10:02 AM\nThe Look of Architecture by Witold Rybczynski.\nSummary of Book:\nWhat is style in architecture?\n\"Style is like a feather in a woman's hat, nothing more,\" said Le Corbusier, expressing most modern architects' low regard for the subject.\nBut Witold Rybczynski disagrees, and in The Look of Architecture, he makes a compelling case for the importance of style to the mother of the arts.\nThis is a book brimming with sharp observations--that form does not follow function; that the best architecture is not timeless but precisely of its time; that details do not merely complement the architecture--details are the architecture.\nBut the heart of the book illuminates the connection between architecture, interior decoration, and fashion.\nStyle is the language of architecture, Rybczynski writes, and fashion represents the wide and swirling cultural currents that shape and direct that language.\nThe two -- style and fashion -- are intimately linked; indeed, architecture cannot escape fashion. To set these ideas in sharp relief, he shows us how style and fashion have been expressed in the work of major architects including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Charles McKim, Allan Greenberg, Robert Venturi, Enrique Norten, and many others. He helps us see their works anew and ultimately to look afresh at our surroundings.\nStyle is one of the enduring--and endearing--aspects of architecture, Rybczynski concludes.\nFurthermore, an architecture that recognizes the importance of style would not be as introspective and self-referential as are so many contemporary buildings. It would be part of the world: Not architecture for architects, but for the rest of us.\nAbout the Author:\nWitold Rybczynski is one of America's best known writers on architecture, the author of the bestselling One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw, Home, Waiting for the Weekend, The Most Beautiful House in the World , and A Clearing in the Distance . He has also written on architecture for The New York Times, The New Yorker, Time , and The New York Review of Books . The Martin and Margy Meyerson Professor of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania, he lives in Philadelphia.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on January 5, 2010 10:03 AM\nThe World Has Curves: The Global Quest for the Perfect Body by Julia Savacool\nAmerican women are spending more time, money, and energy than ever before pursuing an ideal--skinny, tan, and toned--that bears increasingly little resemblance to their reality. But what about the rest of the world's women? How do other cultures define ideal beauty, and do the women of South Africa, Afghanistan, Jamaica, or Japan pursue these standards with equal vigor?\nIn The World Has Curves, Julia Savacool answers these questions and takes readers on a world tour, exploring the ways in which various cultures define their physical \"ideal\" and the extremes to which women will go achieve it.\nThrough extensive research and firsthand interviews, Julia Savacool shares a historical perspective on female beauty, uncovers shocking facts about the beauty business, and relates the intimate stories of women's pursuit of physical perfection.\nFrom plastic surgery in China to appetite stimulants in Jamaica to our own fascination with diminutive celebrities and get-thin-quick gimmicks, Julia Savacool shows readers that the desire to attain a physical ideal is a worldwide phenomenon.\nUltimately, Savacool suggests that female beauty--in America and abroad--is shaped by and inextricably linked to economics.\nWhen it comes to women's bodies, the world is not flat.\nIn fact, it is the many and varied sizes and shapes of the world's women that gives it its curves.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on January 4, 2010 10:36 AM\nShoot the Damn Dog: A Memoir of Depression by Sally Brampton\nA searing, raw memoir of depression that is ultimately uplifting and inspiring.\n\"I believe that we learn through stories. We learn that we are not alone.\"\nSally Brampton is an optimist.\nThe founding editor of Elle, a successful journalist and novelist, she loves gardening, friends and life.\nShe is also a depressive.\nShoot the Damn Dog is a memoir of her journey through depression.\nFor four years her life stood still, mired in the tears, despair and desperate loneliness of mental illness. The brief joy of a stumbled recovery was cruelly, swiftly followed by a relapse into a deeper darkness, alcohol abuse and two suicide attempts.\nHers is a story at once deeply personal and profoundly universal which, by way of shared experience, offers a connection to those who feel so terribly alone and ashamed.\nUnflinching and humble in its honesty, Shoot the Damn Dog blasts the stigma of depression as a character failing or moral flaw and confronts the terrifying illness\nWinston Churchill called the black dog, an illness that humiliates, punishes and isolates its sufferers.\nIt is also a practical book, offering ideas about what might help.\nThere are no promises, only suggestions: small steps towards understanding and managing this illness and slowly coming back into the light.\nWith its raw, understated eloquence, this book will speak volumes to any person whose life has been haunted by depression , as well as offering help and understanding to those whose loved ones suffer from this debilitating condition.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nBy Denise Horoky on December 17, 2009 12:44 PM\nI am on holidays until the new year.\nI wish everyone a peaceful and joyous holiday season.\nMerry Christmas!\nBy Denise Horoky on December 15, 2009 9:22 AM\nRipped: How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music by Gret Kot\nSummary:\nA decade ago the vast majority of mainstream music was funneled through a handful of media conglomerates.\nNow, more people are listening to more music from a greater variety of sources than at any time in history. And big corporations such as Viacom, Clear Channel, and Sony are no longer the sole gatekeepers and distributors, their monopoly busted by a revolution -- an uprising led by bands and fans networking on the Internet.\nRipped tells the story of how the laptop generation created a new grassroots music industry, with the fans and bands rather than the corporations in charge.\nIn this new world, bands aren't just musicmakers but self-contained multimedia businesses; and fans aren't just consumers but distributors and even collaborators.\nAs the Web popularized bands and albums that previously would have been relegated to obscurity, innovative artists -- from Prince to Death Cab for Cutie -- started coming up with, and stumbling into, alternative ways of getting their music out to fans.\nLive music took on an even more significant role.\nTV shows and commercials emerged as great places to hear new tunes.\nSample-based composition and mash-ups leapfrogged ahead of the industry's, and the law's, ability to keep up with them.\nThen, in 2007, Radiohead released an album exclusively on the Internet and allowed customers to name their own price, including $0.00. Radiohead's \"it's up to you\" marketing coup seized on a concept the old music industry had forgotten: the customer is always right.\nNational radio host and critically acclaimed music journalist Greg Kot masterfully chronicles this story of how we went from $17.99 to $0.00 in less than a decade.\nIt's a fascinating tale of backward thinking, forward thinking, and the power of music.\nDisclaimer: Not all of the books featured in \"The Librarian is reading...\" category will be available through Western Libraries, and some of these featured books will be personal copies of the librarian.\nThe Librarian is reading...\nBy Denise Horoky on December 9, 2009 1:28 PM\nOne Square Inch of Silence: One Man's Search for Natural Silence in a Noisy World by Gordon Hempton\nIn the visionary tradition of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, One Square Inch of Silence alerts us to beauty that we take for granted and sounds an urgent environmental alarm.\nNatural silence is our nation's fastest-disappearing resource, warns Emmy-winning acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton, who has made it his mission to record and preserve it in all its variety -- before these soul-soothing terrestrial soundscapes vanish completely in the ever-rising din of man-made noise.\nRecalling the great works on nature written by John Muir, John McPhee, and Peter Matthiessen, this beautifully written narrative, co-authored with John Grossmann, is also a quintessentially American story -- a road trip across the continent from west to east in a 1964 VW bus.\nBut no one has crossed America like this. Armed with his recording equipment and a decibel-measuring sound-level meter, Hempton bends an inquisitive and loving ear to the varied natural voices of the American landscape -- bugling elk, trilling thrushes, and drumming, endangered prairie chickens.\nHe is an equally patient and perceptive listener when talking with people he meets on his journey about the importance of quiet in their lives. By the time he reaches his destination, Washington, D.C., where he meets with federal officials to press his case for natural silence preservation, Hempton has produced a historic and unforgettable sonic EKG of America.\nImbued with the boundless curiosity of original explorers like Lewis & Clark, the incisiveness of Jack Kerouac's observations on the road, and the stirring wisdom of Robert Pirsig repairing an aging vehicle and his life, One Square Inch of Silence provides a moving call to action.\nMore than simply a book, One Square Inch of Silence is an actual place, located in one of America's last vestigial naturally quiet places in Olympic National Park in Washington State. Hempton shares some of his favorite recordings of the park's endangered pristine soundscapes on the enclosed CD. This CD also includes wide-ranging recordings and stunning photographs from his pioneering journey, an inspiring quest for quiet that now adds natural silence to the nation's ecological agenda.\n"}], [{"score": 322.54822, "uuid": "9b5417fa-fcd6-5173-992a-8c57f1145700", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-54-09357", "target_hostname": "dst.gov.in", "target_uri": "http://dst.gov.in/about_us/ar01-02-sr-serc.htm", "page_rank": 1.1841225e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Welcome to Department <em>of</em> Science and Technology, Govt. <em>of</em> India ::", "snippet": "The modules based on this circuitry have been fabricated <em>in</em> the conventional <em>plant</em> <em>of</em> industry, without any change <em>of</em> process <em>or</em> manufacturing unit.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 322.4743, "uuid": "94761d8e-f842-51c3-aa60-9bd4c512b812", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-23-24184", "target_hostname": "www.grassrootsstore.com", "target_uri": "http://www.grassrootsstore.com/made_in_canada_s/133.htm", "page_rank": 1.2664894e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Made <em>in</em> Canada - Grassroots Environmental Products", "snippet": "Recycle: Made <em>in</em> whole, <em>or</em> <em>in</em> part from recycled ingredients and&#x2F;<em>or</em> with recyclable materials.

It was then that the first big brick sewers were built under the streets.\nIn the early nineteenth century many houses were without drains and most of those that had a drain had overflowing cesspools beneath them.\nThe Development of the Drain in London in the 19th Century\nAs the supply of piped water to properties grew permission was being given for more houses to have their drains and water closets connected to the main drainage system until in 1847 it was made compulsory\nThere was a problem though, the outfalls of London\u2019s drains into the Thames were lower than the level of High Tide and the sewerage flooded back into the basement at High Tide.\nWith the population of London increasing, the London drains were blamed for alarming outbreaks of Cholera in 1838, 1841 and 1853.\nIn 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works was created under the chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette\nBetween 1855 and 1874 a drainage sewer was installed that runs parallel with the Thames and pumps the sewerage to the mouth of the Thames Estuary and work was started on purification plant was started. This work was all taken over by the London County Council in 1874.\nThere are reputed to be about 400 miles of large main drainage sewers under London and 2750 miles of local drain sewers.\nThe Modern Drains\nAlthough the drains of nearly all new properties are now connected to the main sewers by very durable and quite flexible plastic piping there are many older houses that connect through ceramic and pottery drain pipes to the main drains.\nMany miles of the sewers built in the early nineteenth century are still doing their work for us under our cities.\nProblems with old drainage\nThe older ceramic pot drainage pipes were much shorter and heavier than their modern counterpart and subject to damage over the years caused by ground slippage or tree root invasion.\nIn most cases property owners are now responsible for the drains running under their land or property and it is possible that Cracked Drains may need Replacement or Re-Lining.\nThis can be an expensive job if it is necessary to dig up the drains to relay them. Damaged drains caused by tree root damage or breakages can never get better unless they are dealt with and constant blockages and foul smells are the same health hazard today that they were in 1838 if they are not dealt with.\nWith modern techniques of CCTV surveys a most damaged drains can be examined without digging up and many can be relined similarly.\nJust like those 2750 miles of drainage sewers underneath London we only become aware of them when things go wrong.\n2 Questions, please ask yours to Drainage Services London\nEden Gregory\nsays:\ni have a recurring problem with my shower getting blocked and i keep having to use drainage unblocker sold from Tesco to unblock it. recently i have been unable to unblock it no matter how much unblocking liquid i pour down the drain.

There are a variety of different explanations.\nAll around us is measurable energy. Not all of this energy is visible or explainable to our five senses but that does not mean that it does not exist.\nIt is now widely recognized that all human beings have an electro-magnetic energy field or auric field surrounding our bodies. This energy field via our chakra and meridian systems is directly connected to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being.\nThe environment, the air we breathe, the food we eat and the thoughts we think can directly affect our health. Crystals and gemstones, as well, have auric fields that can be scientifically measured. It is believed that our electro-magnetic field and the various electro-magnetic fields of crystals interact or communicate. Gem stones and crystals can help restore balance to the human body.\nTo further explain, our biological make-up is electromagnetic, carbon based and liquid crystal lined form. Within our body is every mineral on earth.\nThe human brain contains silica (quartz is from the silicon family) which is used for the storing of electrical charge and the release of light and energy. The outer cortex of the brain contains billions of magnetite crystals, which have a high magnetic vibration within this bio-crystalline form. We also have quartz-like structures such as fatty tissue, cell salt, white blood cells, the lymphatic system and pineal gland. Our bones are crystalline in nature, made of collagen and apatite (which is mainly calcium phosphate). These systems are responsible for mediating the input of higher vibrational energies from the crystals from the etheric bodies into the physical bodies by way of the chakra & meridian systems.\nSo, although we have different forms of consciousness, chemical composition and growth structures, interactions between crystals and humans comes quite naturally. We have this wonderful gift from the mineral kingdom but with it comes responsibility on our part. To use these crystals, we take them from their homes where they have been naturally sustained for hundreds perhaps thousands of years. Contrary to popular belief, crystals do not have limitless energy (the exception being the energetic Master Teacher Crystals). Their energies like ours must be recharged and there are many ways to do this. A few sources are the sun, the moon, the earth, but there are many more.\nThe sun and the moon work well with all crystals. The yellow color of the sun energy brings more self-assertive energies to the crystals, if this is what is needed. Crystals can be laid in the sun for seven hours. This is useful for both men and women. Using the silver colour of the moon energy (full or crescent) for seven hours also works well to recharge your crystals. This energy is subtle, strong feminine energy that is very powerful, very energizing for women or men who wish to be less overly aggressive but more self-assertive.\nEarth Energy (color brown) which is good for Agate, Boji Stones, Calcite, Carnelian, Citrine, Jasper, Mahogany Obsidian, Petrified Wood, Tiger Eye and Tiger Iron. This will bring very healing energies of our planet to the crystals. Place in a glass jar in the earth for at least 7 hours.\nAnother aspect of caring for your crystals is clearing them. All crystals with the exception of smoky quartz, citrine, or morion crystals absorb negative energy that comes into their auric fields. When a crystal fills one of two things will happen. You might feel ill when you touch the crystal or the crystal can eventually explode. So please clear your crystals regularly. (Again Master Stones are an exception - they neutralize negative energy as it passes through them.) There are several ways to clear crystals. Here are a few.\n1. Clearing your crystals by rinsing them under water, termination point down to let negative energy wash away.\n2. Washing them in warm water & very mild dishwashing liquid. Please make sure to rinse them thoroughly, again termination point down.\n* Note for 1 and 2, it is important to know their chemical composition, selenite, for example, would melt away.\n3. Blowing on your crystal with the \u0093Intention\u0094 of clearing.\n4. I personally use a glass pyramid.\nCrystals, I believe are a Gift to help us experience our connectedness to \u0093All that Is\u0094, our Oneness.\nThe higher energy of the crystals when used with love, intention and for the purpose of healing cannot fail. For in the subtle realms, INTENTION IS ACTION.\nReferences:\nDiane Bloom & Bonnie Seeman \u0096 The Kiss Guide to Crystals\nBohmer & Schrieber \u0096 Healing Crystals & Gemstones\nGabriele Lanoue is co-creator of the Inner Peace Awareness Center, check their website for crystals and long distances courses and services . www.innerpeaceawareness.com\nTable of Contents\nHerbal Baths\nBalneotherapy is the ancient art of healing by bathing. It was practiced extensively by the Romans who advocated the use of mineral baths for such diverse ailments as leprosy, arthritis and dropsy (heart disease). They piped water through their towns so that the citizens could soak in aromatic herbal pools, and even named the town of Bath in England after this favoured occupation. Maurice Messugue, the famous French herbalist, had remarkable results treating heads of state and the royal families of Europe exclusively with hand and foot baths. Father Sebastien Kneipp created the healing discipline of hydrotherapy that uses water and herbs to heal all manner of ailment. Today in Europe the taking of a spa retreat always includes therapeutic bathing and hydrotherapy is an honoured method of healing. But you don\u0092t have to travel to enjoy this form of healing - with a little experience you can use herbs effectively at home in baths, foot and hand soaks or in a sauna and enjoy your own customized spa treatments.\nWhat is the correct temperature for a herbal bath? The temperature of the water used for therapeutic bathing is very important. In general hot water is soothing and relaxing to the body, easing cramps and stiffness and drawing heat from the core of the body to the periphery. Cool or cold water is stimulating and tonic to the body and will cause a reflex dilation of the blood vessels in the area being treated to encourage blood flow to this part.\nContrast bathing with hot and cold alternating water can be very effective as a stimulant to all the body parts as can finishing a hot shower or bath with a quick cold splash! Generally, though, herbal baths are taken in warm or hot water and are as much of a pleasure as a medicine.\nHow to make a herbal bath: The best way to make a herbal bath is to take a generous handful of dried herbs and place them in a drawstring muslin bag. Hang the bag off the hot tap so that the water runs through it. Or you can make a pot of very strong herbal tea and pour it into the bath. Another method would be to use essential oils which are very concentrated plant extracts. Use 10 to 15 drops of an oil blend - but be careful, essential oils are very strong and you should treat them with respect. If you are making a hand or foot soak simply use less herb and water accordingly. To use herbs in a sauna use a strong herbal tea as the water you splash on the stones. The scented steam will fill the sauna and the suspended particles of oil will penetrate the skin to exert a therapeutic effect. Do not put essential oils directly on the hot stones as this will cause burning of the delicate ingredients.\nWhat herbs to use in the bath: Most herbs which are used in baths tend to be aromatic. The essential oils are released by the leaves or flowers and not only smell nice but are powerfully therapeutic as well. Essential oils are, of course, not water soluble and tend to escape the hostile environment of the bath water by soaking into your skin very quickly - it is almost as if the water drives them in. This is much more effective than if they are simply rubbed onto the skin with almond oil. So, generally speaking, the more highly scented a herb the more effective it will be in a herbal bath. Some herbs also release non-scented properties which are medicinal. An example of this would be mucilage (a complex sugar molecule) which is released into the water by many plants. This serves as a skin soother and softener as well as being nourishing to the skin.\nRefreshing Herbs: Use in the morning and any time you want to waken up add sparkle to your life: Pine needles, Rosemary, Peppermint, Lemon grass, Eucalyptus, Hibiscus. Relaxing Herbs: Use in the evening for bed or any time you need to unwind and let go of tension: Chamomile, Lavander, Lemon balm, Vervain, Hops, Valerian, Lobelia. Warming Herbs: Use with tired and aching muscles and to ease stiffness or cramps including the pain of arthritis: Black pepper, Marjoram, Basil, Oregano, Juniper, Ginger, Cajeput.\nSkin Softening Herbs: Use with dry or irritated skin including excema: Plantain, Chamomile, Calendula, Rose petals, Chickweed, Oatmeal, Irish Moss, Mullein, Red Clover.\nAntiseptic Herbs: Use as a local soak where there is superficial infection such as a dirty cut, a deep splinter, or a skin infection: Goldenseal, Myrrh, Sage, White or Red Oak bark.\nAnti Fungal and Anti Parasitic Herbs: Use with fungal skin infections such as athletes foot or ringworm as well as with infestations such as scabies, lice or fleas: Black walnut, Sassafras, Tansy, Wormwood and Tea tree oil.\nPurely For Pleasure: Some herbs and especially many essential oils smell so delicious that you don\u0092t need a reason to immerse yourself in them! Sandalwood, Ylang ylang, Benzoin, Bergamot, Petigrain, Rose geranium and Basil are some of my favourite essential oils for a truly luxurious bathing experience. Rose petals, Lavender and Chamomile are a pretty flower mix for a soothing and healing bath.\nChanchal Cabrera MSc, MNIMH, AHG is a medical herbalist.

It is an ancient remembering of Who We Really Are; an inner pathway to reconnecting with and finally unlocking our Healer Within, Higher Self, Inner Wisdom, God/Goddess), Divine Child Within - or whatever we choose to call our Divine Essence.\nThe moment we remember how to access and surrender to this spontaneous process, we start liberating ourselves physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually from the pain of lifetimes of trying to control our innate spontaneity, our environment and life itself. In SM we regain the spontaneity that we stifled when, as little children, we started trying to \u0093fit in\u0094 to a crazy adult world of pretence.\nIn Sacred Movement (SM) - which can be physical, emotional, mental (insights, information and inspiration), or spiritual - all previously perceived limitations fall away, we naturally set ourselves free from the need to control, and experience \u0093Something Bigger\u0094 showing us the way home.\nWe do not do SM, we allow it - and the moment we surrender, it spontaneously becomes an undoing of all that no longer serves us and we start dissolving all that is not Love and Light. Yet it is perfectly safe, for our Healer Within will not allow ourselves to hurt ourselves. Therefore the \u0093healing\u0094 or transformation that takes place during each session is incremental \u0096 to the exact extent that we are able to integrate. Whatever unfolds is whatever the priority is for us at that specific moment in time \u0096 which might be very different to what we \u0093think\u0094 it ought to be!\nAt times the moves may be purely physical as our skeleton, muscles, tendons realign so that our energy can flow more optimally. Sometimes these movements unblock stagnant energy that may rise to the surface as either heat or emotions; sometimes the experience is purely emotional (and vocal); at others purely spiritual; or purely informational. It may be a mix of any or all of these, which may move through us in waves. At other times there may be the experience of a deep-deep sleep-state, where the \u0093healing\u0094 is neurological. Therefore the experience is different for everyone - and different every time we enter it \u0096 and so it never becomes stagnant, it remains an adventure into the unknown. The last frontier!\nSM has, since it spontaneously blossomed in the Year 2000, revealed itself to have touch-points with spontaneous expressions of various forms of yoga (including tantra), body work, energy work, rebirthing and other processes, bellydance, trans-dance and other forms of movement, toning and other forms of voice-work, past-life recall and other shamanic practices. It is in essence a deep Remembering of what we all already know deep within our DNA-coding.\nEvery session incrementally increases the individual\u0092s energetic frequency \u0096 a slight tune-up to the extent that the individual is able to comfortably accommodate. Those who have experienced the discomfort of spontaneous Kundalini awakenings have found SM to bring back a deep sense of Grounding, Connecting and Balancing their energy. The practice of a specific series of \u0091GCB Moves\u0092 at the start and end of every sessions helps everyone achieve this.\nWith daily practice \u0096 which we soon start yearning for \u0096 Sacred Movement becomes a place where we can return to whenever we feel ungrounded, depleted, confused, upset (unloved), need \u0091healing\u0092 or a \u0091tune-up\u0092 of any kind \u0096 or whenever we are moved to give jubilant thanks! It is a place that is always available to us, in every moment in every day, wherever we are! The more we practice, the more we are able to sustain our Being Present in the outer world, and the more we witness the Presence of Love and Light in everyone and everything around us. Who would say no to that?\nIf your spirit says \u0093YES this is what I have been asking for\u0094 call Christina Nienaber-Roberts. She gently guides people to reconnect with this Sacred Gift in workshops and one -on-one consultations.

Suddenly it hit me; you CAN teach old dogs new tricks and help people change at the same time! (Crystal Pup would have definitely agreed!)\nBelieve it or not, training your dog is fun, healthy for both of you, and can even save his life! How many times have you seen a dog running down the street being chased by their owner who is screaming, \u0093ROVER! COME HERE!\u0094. What a grand game for the dog, yet what a dangerous game if he runs into traffic. Worse, yet again, what if you blindly follow him! Many dogs have died after being hit by a car and it could have been avoided if they were properly trained.\nMy story goes like this. A year and a half ago, my daughter was aware that her dog Ben (a two year old Lab cross) needed training. Like most people, she was not having success on her own. I had just signed up Pluto, (my five month old Heeler), in an obedience course, so they excitedly joined us.\nNow Ben really IS an excitable guy. He loves everyone, loves other dogs, loves to romp, loves to run and play. Within minutes of the first class, Ben was barking, romping and pulling on his lead, while another dog was snarling at him. My daughter was trying to hold him back and the trainer was barking out orders. My daughter was embarrassed, frustrated and close to tears. The whole thing was total chaos. The dog was pulled out of the class and measured for a prong collar. \u0093prong collars are meant to apply pressure around the neck by pinching the dog\u0092s skin together but can be extremely dangerous if not properly fitted and used by a professional.\u0092\nDue to my training in alternative health, I saw a number of things, in both humans and dogs that was not readily seen by other participants. I was shocked, at the emotional trauma, the pain and hurt of someone being shunned for the very reason they asked for help in the first place, not to mention the danger for the dog wearing a prong collar.\nThen, I realized three things\u0085one, in my belief system, ridicule and embarrassment is not a proper foundation for change and that includes dog\u0092s learning to interact with their owners; two, I already knew how to train a dog; and three, I could help others train their dogs in a relaxed calming setting! \u0093I\u0092m going to train dogs\u0094, I silently declared. Actually, my foundation was solidly in place, I just hadn\u0092t noticed. I had spent a lifetime teaching family and friends dog how \u0091to do things\u0092. I bred and trained Siberian Huskies, yet I never considered myself a trainer. This is an example of finding the pearl of wisdom in everything...the GIFT! As the New Year blossoms, I invite you to also be aware of the hidden talents you may have - waiting to be recognized!\nThe end result...I researched, studied, took some courses and finally created something to \u0091fill the gap\u0094 for other people like myself. I threw tradition aside, and created a mobile dog training business. Like people, dogs learn quicker in a relaxed atmosphere. Success is achieved quicker and everyone is happy! Most importantly, dog\u0092s lives are saved. Saved from the dangers of running into the street, saved from being named a \u0091bad\u0092 dog, saved from being sent to the SPCA because their owners feel their dogs are a lost cause or from being picked up \u0093at large\u0094 and put into a shelter.\nWe brought these wild animals into our homes and expect them to be as human as we are. We owe it to them to teach them how to be a part of our world. While we\u0092re at it, we should take a minute to offer gratitude to \u0091whatever name you give the Creator\u0092. Gratitude for having these wonderful, brilliant, funny, loving and entertaining animals in our lives.\nNancy Hedberg is a Professional Pet Dog Trainer / member of the Canadian Association of Professional Pet Dog Trainers.

It would look quite dashing along side my black velvet coat! OK...maybe I\u0092m going a bit to far here...but LOVE is in the air and vibration is the code word of the day... so why couldn\u0092t that bluebird and I vibrate together in harmony! I believe we can!\nVibration... wow, everywhere someone is talkin about vibration! Yahoo! It\u0092s about time we are finally talking the same language. I think I\u0092m going to teach a workshop on how to purrrrr! Think about it, why are cats generally so happy? It\u0092s hard to be grumpy when you are purring, and it activates your heart.\nI am rather fond of this attention on energy. People are looking into my eyes and listening to hear what I have to say. Holy white whiskers! This is a gigantic breakthrough. What a way to dissolve the communication barriers - what a way to spread LOVE. Take a look at my fancy photo up there...see that big white heart I wear on my chest. It\u0092s my inner spirit showing you how much I love you.\nAs you can see, I am precisely perched beside a big crystal bowl. I love them too, as you can see from the smile on my face. When the bowls start to play people think I will run off - not so. Actually when I\u0092m outside, I can feel them ringing and I run home on purpose.\nI also love to watch people become lighter and brighter when they sing. Sometimes I jump in, curl up and have a nap but a big guy like me has to be careful not to break things.\nWe had a neighbour cat once who used to come in my cat door and jump inside this bowl. He\u0092d run around in circles and ring it all by himself. He looked quite big but he was really all white and fluffy and really light - I think that\u0092s how he did it. Pity you couldn\u0092t train a cat to do that all the time. I\u0092ll have to talk to my friend Nancy, she trains dogs, maybe she could do something for us felines.\nI\u0092m showing you this crystal bowl so you remember to include your pets when you start being more vibrationally conscious. They\u0092ll love it. On the other hand some pets have sensitive ears and physical systems JUST LIKE YOU. Too much too often can be uncomfortable at first. Use caution - and NEVER put your pet in a bowl and ring it. NO NO NO. You would really hurt them. It is different if they do it gently themselves. Much different.\nSo if you want to join my purring class - send me an email. Heck, the pup sez, if you can teach an old dog new tricks, there\u0092s hope for you too! So don\u0092t be shy! Well, on that love-rly note, I\u0092m off to look for the bluebird. Love You!\nTable of Contents\nPower of Cells\nThe world we live in is complete with all the resources we need to sustain and achieve optimum health. It comes as no surprise, that natural sources provide powerful elements to assist our bodies in healing themselves one cell at a time.\nThe Amethyst Bio-Mat transmits the natural healing properties of the sun, the soothing healing elements of air and water and the power of the mineral kingdom. All this together in a mat you sleep on every night!\nThe Bio-Mat uses far-infrared light, negative ions and the healing power of amethyst and tourmaline crystals that act on our bodies \u0096 a combination that has become an FDA medical device in the United States.\nA cell consists of many components that work together, creating a harmonious movement of elements in and out of the cell. The health of these components determines a cell\u0092s ability to perform the functions it needs to sustain life and optimum health.\nThe interior and exterior environments of a cell differ in a variety of ways. For example, there is a difference in the content of positive sodium and potassium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. This difference creates an electrical potential between these two environments which is called a membrane potential. This potential is crucial in that it controls the movement of specific ions entering a cell and allowing acidic waste and other ions to exit the cell through the membrane\u0092s ionic channels.\nWhen our bodies suffer from disease, bodily malfunction or damage, it causes cells to be in a state of positive polarity. This imbalance affects a cell\u0092s ability to remove accumulated waste and thus prohibits its ability to receive needed nutrients.\nThe negative ions released from the Bio-Mat help reverse the polarity of cells\u0092 membrane potential to a negative state. Therefore, ionic channels are opened, waste exits and nutrients enter. Through this process, cellular communication and function is improved and the healing process begins. In addition to acting upon a cell\u0092s ionic channels, they also have a cleansing effect on the air and the body\u0092s cells; nature\u0092s way of \u0091cleaning things up\u0092.\nThe far-infrared light utilized in the Bio-Mat is a source of heat energy that works in balancing the cooling and cleansing effect of the negative ions. When we apply heat to the body we are increasing circulation, chemical break down, and the rate of nutrient, mineral and hormone distribution in the body via the blood system. The Bio-Mat delivers a long wave of far-infrared light that is able to penetrate the body to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. This light wave passes through skin, bones, muscle fibers, nerves, tissues and organs, delivering the required essential nutrients to all of these systems. The combination of the cooling qualities of the negative ions and the heating qualities of the far-infrared light, work together as a natural detoxification process.\nIt is a misconception that healing is the process of fixing old damaged cells. In reality, healing occurs when new healthy cells are produced. We reproduce every cell in our body in order to maintain the interrelated functions of our body. Therefore, when the correct elements and energy are available to produce new healthy cells, we are truly in the healing process.\nSo how does the Amethyst Bio-Mat create these natural energies? The Bio-Mat can be placed on your bed or your massage table. The controller attached to the Bio-Mat is then plugged into the wall. The Bio-Mat controller converts the alternating current from our outlets into a direct current that maintains a constant flow of electrons in a single direction from low to high potential. Because the alternating current has a magnitude and direction that varies above and below the current\u0092s threshold line, constantly wavering like what we see in fluorescent lights, the direct current is able to stabilize the needed energy source.\nAs the direct current travels to the surface of the Bio-Mat, it interacts with the mat\u0092s Carbonic Japanese Kurera Super Fibers (layer #9 - see ad below) creating a negatively charged potential field, due to the natural conductivity of carbon. When this negative potential is applied to our bodies, more calcium and sodium minerals are circulating in the blood stream. This process changes an acidified body to an alkaline body. The direct current continues to flow through the Bio-Mat and interacts with an additional layer called the Ceramic Japanese Kurera\u0092s Super Fiber (layer # 7). These fibers differ due to the ceramic\u0092s natural conductivity for the far-infrared light utilized by the Bio-Mat. When the farinfrared light hits the amethyst crystal located on the top of the mat, it changes the far-infrared light from a short wave to a long wave far-infrared light. As mentioned, the conversion from short to long waves of far-infrared light penetrates the deeper regions of the body.\nThe Amethyst Bio-Mat is a tool that can assist the body in healing itself using resources found in nature. Our bodies are extremely intricate and fascinating creations, with the full potential to achieve a natural state of health and wellbeing.\nTable of Contents\nCrystal Bowls\nWith the release of two wonderful movies \u0093What the Bleep\u0094 and \u0093The Secret\u0094, along with information about The Law of Attraction, most of us are starting to understand at a deep level that our thoughts and our personal rate of vibration create our reality. A basic law of physics states that like attracts like. When we think of ourselves as beings with energy fields, that our thoughts create vibrations, it is easier to understand why we get what we get in life. Our circumstances are a perfect match to what we resonate with; it is all in our vibrations.\nWhat can I do to increase my rate of vibration so I can enjoy more of the things I want in my life? While the obvious answer is to always think positive, I know from experience this isn\u0092t always easy.Those unconscious thoughts keep popping up in spite of my good intentions! Fortunately, there is another way of increasing vibration and that is through the application of sound into our energy fields with Crystal Singing Bowls. Combining the power of positive thought with the high vibrational tones of the crystal bowls, we increase our creative power exponentially. When I want to manifest something into my life, I go into a meditation and visualize that I already have it. As I begin to \u0093feel\u0094 that my creation is complete, I begin to play my bowl and imagine that the sound waves from the bowl and my thoughts are moving out into the universe, the high vibrational sound becomes the carrier wave for my intention.\nCrystal Bowls also work to heal us on a physical and emotional level as well. Our bodies are crystalline in structure and playing Crystal Bowls can have profound effects on the organs, cells, and skeletal structure bringing all systems into balance. The pure waves of sound that ring from the crystal bowls are angelic and enhance our ability to listen, hear and focus. Hearing occurs with more than our ears. Sound is vibration, and that vibration moves throughout our energy fields. With the crystal bowls, we can feel the sound as much as we hear it. The pure tones affect brain wave activity, and as different parts of the brain are affected, hormones and neuro-chemicals are released that suppress pain, overcome addictions, strengthen willpower, and enhance our creativity. Vibration also equals sound waves, and we can change the course of our lives through the application of sound into our energy fields with crystal singing bowls.\nLora Teuschler is a Certified Sound Healer and a Registered Karuna Reiki Master/Teacher call her at (250) 714-8358.\nTable of Contents\nImportance of Clarity\nAs this new year begins, be aware that the choices we make each day become more and more important\u0085not only to our souls, but to all of humanity, and to Mother Gaia. To make the choices best for our own soul development, and ultimately for humanity, we require Clarity.\nWithout Clarity we can not see when it is our own wounds speaking. Without Clarity we can not hear our own fears directing our lives & choices. Without Clarity we can not find our true purpose. Without Clarity we can not possibly make the best choices for our soul and our growth.\nHow is it we find Clarity? Is it a pill we take? A book we read? A mantra we chant? The next workshop or the next healer we find? Clarity is none of these. Clarity is found by listening, with our hearts open, to our God Presence, the deepest part of our soul. It is this inner voice that only speaks the truth.\nThe inner voice which only speaks from a place of love & forgiveness, never from a place of fear, revenge, anger or hatred. Clarity is the resonance of our soul to God/Goddess. It is the truth we all seek to hear and learn, a gift of wisdom from the heart, bringing forth the knowledge and experience from all your lifetimes.\nClarity comes from choosing the light, the love, and God/Goddess. It comes from divine service to the planet, during deep meditation when our heart opens and we hear with all our beingness, hear without expectations.\nClarity is the knowingness that only through \u0093surrender\u0094 can we be whole and truly guided. The knowingness that we create our own lives, the good, the \u0093bad\u0094 and everything in between. Clarity is the joy we find by making our choices from the heart and from love.\nClarity comes as we remove the veils which surround us and cloud our vision. It appears as we find the silence, allowing us to hear our God Presence - turn off the television, put down the newspaper, and shut off the computer. Clarity comes when we visit Mother Gaia, and feel the earth or water beneath our feet, and the wind on our face. When we stop focusing on all our \u0093wants\u0094 and are grateful for all in our life...Clarity comes!\nBeloveds, I AM Archangel Clarity. Please know I am always here to assist you. Call upon me, open your hearts - just listen, and know that when you ask, I will answer. Be sure to listen, even when it is not what you wish to hear.\nAs all of humanity continues to awaken and more choose a spiritual path, I offer you a gift. A gift to assist you with self clarity. Now Beloveds, if you wish... Take 3 deep, slow breaths, hold, and then slowly exhale, releasing all the tension from your body. Close your eyes, and state your intent to receive this gift.\nSee, feel or know that I come forward and place a golden liquid lovelight ring in your 3rd eye chakra. Feel it gently enter your 3rd eye, and spin clockwise, and then counter-clockwise as it activates. When your heart is open, this ring will assist you with selfclarity.\nKnow Beloveds, that the more open your heart, and the higher vibration of love you hold, the more clarity you will have. I urge you to make your choices from a place of love & clarity. Namaste, I AM Archangel Clarity.\nChannelled by Emissary of Love, AnaLaRai 250-752-5117 or laurie.sagle@sympatico.ca\nTable of Contents\nSage: A Messenger\u0092s Message\n\"In ancient times a SAGE was a messenger, delivering profound truths to an individual or a collective group\" ...

Where western doctors focus on symptoms, shamanic healers concentrate on the emotional, psychological and physical selves, acting as midwives for the process of achieving holistic health and harmony. Shamanic interventions can provide relief from long-standing emotional issues and behavioural patterns; restore natural energy by dispersing the heavy energy of an individual, group, building, or even a business.\nMany people think of healing as a quantum process; leaping from a state of illness to a state of health. While this phenomena can certainly occur, more often than not, the Great Spirit embarks us on a journey of incrementally recreating our minds, bodies and spirits. It has the power to recreate us at any given moment.\nDisease often manifests as a reflection of a contaminated mind. Our minds can create a paradigm of illness, accidents and injuries. Allowing and opening ourselves to the Creator to recreate within us a new paradigm of light and hope facilitates a reflection of health to then manifest in our lives.\nIn his classic book, The Way of the Shaman (Harper & Row) Michael Harner, PHD., tells us that shamans, \u0093are keepers of a remarkable body of ancient techniques that they use to achieve and maintain well-being and healing for themselves and their communities.\u0094\nThere are many South American shamanic interventions including the Illumination Process, Akashic Imprint Extractions, Despacho Ceremonies as well as Path Of Destiny Guidance. Some shamanic practitioners are trained in all of the above. Practitioners vary dramatically depending on who their teachers have been.Often it is necessary to travel to other parts of the world to connect with special teachers like: Ipupiara Peixoto of the Ure Wau Wau nation in the rainforests of Brazil; and Claicha Toscano of the Quechua nation in the Peruvian Andes or the late Wallace Black Elk - author of \u0093Black Elk- the Secret Ways of a Lakota.\u0094\nThe most vital component in shamanism is the practitioner\u0092s relationship to the Divine. This is the foundation of Power from which the shaman helps to facilitate health in the client. The shaman\u0092s primary function is to pray to the Great Spirit to bring health and help to the client. Without this foundation, the shaman is without true power to facilitate healing in anyone.\nThe shaman also teaches us how to reintroduce the Sacred into every aspect of our lives and communities. This helps us to become more in touch with our natural environments; bringing us balance, harmony and awareness.\nPrivate healing sessions with Kat McCooeye at (250) 752-0627 She says,\u0093It is an honour to provide this service to the public. All shamanic interventions and procedures are employed within Sacred Space, in accordance with Sacred Law. I am merely a facilitator, or conduit for the divine healing energy of the Creator.\nLIGHTonLIGHT\nSHINEing with LOVE from the INSIDE Out\nWe are the vibration of the 999 speaking to you through the energetic system of what you call the Grand Council of Light. We connect to you from the farthest reaches of the resonance of Light - from what some of you would equate with the vibration of \u0091home\u0092.\nIt was never our intention to be an active part in the project we call \u0091Transformation Planet Earth\u0092, although we were instrumental in its creation. Yet the integrity of love from your hearts beating as one, before the concept was a common word, inspired us to begin to direct activities of the highest sort on your behalf. Some will find an ancient comfort in these words...some will feel the sense of the power of this Now. We have been quietly monitoring your acivities for 15 of your earth years, carefully grooming the vibratory channels to this particular Island of Light and Love (Vancouver Island - one of 12 world power places - Keys of Enoch). We consider this the number of the 5+5+5 or simply put, the 555 vibration of miracles and healing.\nThere is no accident that this number should now align with 2007 in your time which many see to carry the vibration of the 777. Indeed it does and you will be amazed to discover what a gentle loving energy that is. But we remind you here at the beginning that this year of yours is also truly resonating a parallel vibration of the 999...where enlightened power and wisdom come together in service to the all. Hear what we say - in service! This great gift can only be used with loving integrity or it will simply dissipate...there is no room for misuse - only the complete trust for yourself and others who choose to cocreate with you.\nIt matters not if you were aware of our presence before this moment. We have no interest in what you call public recognition. Indeed we have preferred to be barely visible as it has facilitated the speed with which our assistance has been utilized and integrated on your planet. The path of resistance to our reigniting the energetic fields with love has been miniscule compared to what it may have been..all because we did little to draw attention to our mission. Some of you would be clever to consider this concept for yourself. You search for public recognition without fully contemplating how your lives would change if your wish was granted. The quiet privacy you treasure would all but disappear.\nSo many people seeking you out to assist them...glamourous perhaps but it takes a heart of great strength to master that test without becoming a slave to senseless self-adoration. Equality is the heartbeat of these times and those who have elevated themselves to the so-called higher ground will be surprised and perhaps uncomfortable as the pedestals begin to dissolve. Certainly there will always be a need for leaders and loving guides - whose intention is to assist you to empower yourselves. Perhaps an even greater need in these evolving times as many will begin to rise up from the ashes, like the great phoenix itself.\nThe concept of the Triad of Vibrations may stretch some of your minds, still we say to you, that the three: the 555/777/999 WILL create a symphony of sound, light and colour with those who feel the potential transformation of that pulse. These are indeed the days many of you have been waiting for. If you are to fully utilize this energetic space - we say again to note the importance of the water in your physical bodies and in all that is around you. Fill yourself up with an endless supply that you may clear the channels for what is to come. Gather together as you have in the past and Bless the Water of your world...that the crystalline structure may redefine itself to the original template. Bless each other and yourselves at every opportunity you can manifest. This is a critical acccellerator in your pursuit for freedom from the old ties that bind you. You are loved beyond your imagination, and the brilliance of The Light and Love from where we reside, is even greater than what some of you call \u0091neardeath experiences\u0092 like walking through the Window of Light and experiencing what you call God. Your human vessel is only capable of experiencing a small portion of that vibration, yet it is our intention to continue to assist you to feel MORE of that loving brilliance.\nYou ARE a crystalline being as we have spoken over and over for years of your time/no-time and you begin to feel this more and more. We say, when you allow your human brains to accept this truth you will discover this trinity of the 555/ 777/999 to be ultimately incredible. The crystals on your planet - the Master Stones of Transformation are ALL on Energertic Alert right Now...prepared to serve you at your request. They are dedicated to assisting you to speed up the vibration of the crystalline body within you, as they have for eons of your time but now - you are ready with hearts capable of holding the sacred patterns necessary for that vibration to expand in utmost clarity. These are the most exciting times the universe has ever seen and now many of you understand why you did not give up and go home when the opportunities presented themselves. You have all been tested and passed with flying colours whether you believe it or not. It is the reality that you are indeed still breathing on planet earth - that proves out point. There we watch you in all your brilliance - breathing in love, and breathing out love, from one side of mother earth to the other, and likewise through the very core of her. What a celebration... what a long awaited victory! BE proud that you never gave up and prepare yourself to enjoy the song of the universe singing within you. Heart to heart we are aligned with the presence of integrity. Heart to heart we reunite - step by step, with love beyond measure - gently - there is no hurry - this is a year to stop the clock and allow all that you are to manifest into reality. DREAM! Capture your finest ones that they may unveil themselves before your very eyes - bless them that their physical creating will be perfection before your very eyes. Imagine - the gong of the universe singing within you now!\nTo be in the vibrational resonnance of the 999, you are invited to attend designated gatherings of the Grand Council of Light. 250-754-9667 or visit www.LIGHTonLIGHT.net\n"}, {"score": 314.74844, "uuid": "1181ec63-4e91-5423-bd4d-e1ed367837a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1913wb-50-17607", "target_hostname": "www.eagleyeone.com", "target_uri": "http://www.eagleyeone.com/archives/one61.html", "page_rank": 1.1772645e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "EAGLEye &#x2F; ONE Magazine ~ metaphysical new age journal ~ holistic <em>health</em>", "snippet": "The most vital component <em>in</em> shamanism <em>is</em> the practitioner\u0092s relationship to the Divine.

There are a variety of different explanations.\nAll around us is measurable energy. Not all of this energy is visible or explainable to our five senses but that does not mean that it does not exist.\nIt is now widely recognized that all human beings have an electro-magnetic energy field or auric field surrounding our bodies. This energy field via our chakra and meridian systems is directly connected to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being.\nThe environment, the air we breathe, the food we eat and the thoughts we think can directly affect our health. Crystals and gemstones, as well, have auric fields that can be scientifically measured. It is believed that our electro-magnetic field and the various electro-magnetic fields of crystals interact or communicate. Gem stones and crystals can help restore balance to the human body.\nTo further explain, our biological make-up is electromagnetic, carbon based and liquid crystal lined form. Within our body is every mineral on earth.\nThe human brain contains silica (quartz is from the silicon family) which is used for the storing of electrical charge and the release of light and energy. The outer cortex of the brain contains billions of magnetite crystals, which have a high magnetic vibration within this bio-crystalline form. We also have quartz-like structures such as fatty tissue, cell salt, white blood cells, the lymphatic system and pineal gland. Our bones are crystalline in nature, made of collagen and apatite (which is mainly calcium phosphate). These systems are responsible for mediating the input of higher vibrational energies from the crystals from the etheric bodies into the physical bodies by way of the chakra & meridian systems.\nSo, although we have different forms of consciousness, chemical composition and growth structures, interactions between crystals and humans comes quite naturally. We have this wonderful gift from the mineral kingdom but with it comes responsibility on our part. To use these crystals, we take them from their homes where they have been naturally sustained for hundreds perhaps thousands of years. Contrary to popular belief, crystals do not have limitless energy (the exception being the energetic Master Teacher Crystals). Their energies like ours must be recharged and there are many ways to do this. A few sources are the sun, the moon, the earth, but there are many more.\nThe sun and the moon work well with all crystals. The yellow color of the sun energy brings more self-assertive energies to the crystals, if this is what is needed. Crystals can be laid in the sun for seven hours. This is useful for both men and women. Using the silver colour of the moon energy (full or crescent) for seven hours also works well to recharge your crystals. This energy is subtle, strong feminine energy that is very powerful, very energizing for women or men who wish to be less overly aggressive but more self-assertive.\nEarth Energy (color brown) which is good for Agate, Boji Stones, Calcite, Carnelian, Citrine, Jasper, Mahogany Obsidian, Petrified Wood, Tiger Eye and Tiger Iron. This will bring very healing energies of our planet to the crystals. Place in a glass jar in the earth for at least 7 hours.\nAnother aspect of caring for your crystals is clearing them. All crystals with the exception of smoky quartz, citrine, or morion crystals absorb negative energy that comes into their auric fields. When a crystal fills one of two things will happen. You might feel ill when you touch the crystal or the crystal can eventually explode. So please clear your crystals regularly. (Again Master Stones are an exception - they neutralize negative energy as it passes through them.) There are several ways to clear crystals. Here are a few.\n1. Clearing your crystals by rinsing them under water, termination point down to let negative energy wash away.\n2. Washing them in warm water & very mild dishwashing liquid. Please make sure to rinse them thoroughly, again termination point down.\n* Note for 1 and 2, it is important to know their chemical composition, selenite, for example, would melt away.\n3. Blowing on your crystal with the \u0093Intention\u0094 of clearing.\n4. I personally use a glass pyramid.\nCrystals, I believe are a Gift to help us experience our connectedness to \u0093All that Is\u0094, our Oneness.\nThe higher energy of the crystals when used with love, intention and for the purpose of healing cannot fail. For in the subtle realms, INTENTION IS ACTION.\nReferences:\nDiane Bloom & Bonnie Seeman \u0096 The Kiss Guide to Crystals\nBohmer & Schrieber \u0096 Healing Crystals & Gemstones\nGabriele Lanoue is co-creator of the Inner Peace Awareness Center, check their website for crystals and long distances courses and services . www.innerpeaceawareness.com\nTable of Contents\nHerbal Baths\nBalneotherapy is the ancient art of healing by bathing. It was practiced extensively by the Romans who advocated the use of mineral baths for such diverse ailments as leprosy, arthritis and dropsy (heart disease). They piped water through their towns so that the citizens could soak in aromatic herbal pools, and even named the town of Bath in England after this favoured occupation. Maurice Messugue, the famous French herbalist, had remarkable results treating heads of state and the royal families of Europe exclusively with hand and foot baths. Father Sebastien Kneipp created the healing discipline of hydrotherapy that uses water and herbs to heal all manner of ailment. Today in Europe the taking of a spa retreat always includes therapeutic bathing and hydrotherapy is an honoured method of healing. But you don\u0092t have to travel to enjoy this form of healing - with a little experience you can use herbs effectively at home in baths, foot and hand soaks or in a sauna and enjoy your own customized spa treatments.\nWhat is the correct temperature for a herbal bath? The temperature of the water used for therapeutic bathing is very important. In general hot water is soothing and relaxing to the body, easing cramps and stiffness and drawing heat from the core of the body to the periphery. Cool or cold water is stimulating and tonic to the body and will cause a reflex dilation of the blood vessels in the area being treated to encourage blood flow to this part.\nContrast bathing with hot and cold alternating water can be very effective as a stimulant to all the body parts as can finishing a hot shower or bath with a quick cold splash! Generally, though, herbal baths are taken in warm or hot water and are as much of a pleasure as a medicine.\nHow to make a herbal bath: The best way to make a herbal bath is to take a generous handful of dried herbs and place them in a drawstring muslin bag. Hang the bag off the hot tap so that the water runs through it. Or you can make a pot of very strong herbal tea and pour it into the bath. Another method would be to use essential oils which are very concentrated plant extracts. Use 10 to 15 drops of an oil blend - but be careful, essential oils are very strong and you should treat them with respect. If you are making a hand or foot soak simply use less herb and water accordingly. To use herbs in a sauna use a strong herbal tea as the water you splash on the stones. The scented steam will fill the sauna and the suspended particles of oil will penetrate the skin to exert a therapeutic effect. Do not put essential oils directly on the hot stones as this will cause burning of the delicate ingredients.\nWhat herbs to use in the bath: Most herbs which are used in baths tend to be aromatic. The essential oils are released by the leaves or flowers and not only smell nice but are powerfully therapeutic as well. Essential oils are, of course, not water soluble and tend to escape the hostile environment of the bath water by soaking into your skin very quickly - it is almost as if the water drives them in. This is much more effective than if they are simply rubbed onto the skin with almond oil. So, generally speaking, the more highly scented a herb the more effective it will be in a herbal bath. Some herbs also release non-scented properties which are medicinal. An example of this would be mucilage (a complex sugar molecule) which is released into the water by many plants. This serves as a skin soother and softener as well as being nourishing to the skin.\nRefreshing Herbs: Use in the morning and any time you want to waken up add sparkle to your life: Pine needles, Rosemary, Peppermint, Lemon grass, Eucalyptus, Hibiscus. Relaxing Herbs: Use in the evening for bed or any time you need to unwind and let go of tension: Chamomile, Lavander, Lemon balm, Vervain, Hops, Valerian, Lobelia. Warming Herbs: Use with tired and aching muscles and to ease stiffness or cramps including the pain of arthritis: Black pepper, Marjoram, Basil, Oregano, Juniper, Ginger, Cajeput.\nSkin Softening Herbs: Use with dry or irritated skin including excema: Plantain, Chamomile, Calendula, Rose petals, Chickweed, Oatmeal, Irish Moss, Mullein, Red Clover.\nAntiseptic Herbs: Use as a local soak where there is superficial infection such as a dirty cut, a deep splinter, or a skin infection: Goldenseal, Myrrh, Sage, White or Red Oak bark.\nAnti Fungal and Anti Parasitic Herbs: Use with fungal skin infections such as athletes foot or ringworm as well as with infestations such as scabies, lice or fleas: Black walnut, Sassafras, Tansy, Wormwood and Tea tree oil.\nPurely For Pleasure: Some herbs and especially many essential oils smell so delicious that you don\u0092t need a reason to immerse yourself in them! Sandalwood, Ylang ylang, Benzoin, Bergamot, Petigrain, Rose geranium and Basil are some of my favourite essential oils for a truly luxurious bathing experience. Rose petals, Lavender and Chamomile are a pretty flower mix for a soothing and healing bath.\nChanchal Cabrera MSc, MNIMH, AHG is a medical herbalist.

See her article on pg 14/15 for a taste of what her new book is about. www.iuniverse.com ISBN 0-595-40203-8\nVisit our website later in January - we will have more extensive informtion on many of these items.\nTable of Contents\nSacred Movement\nSacred Movement is a Gift that lies slumbering within each and every one of us, waiting to be acknowledged and given permission to guide us towards Optimum Health - and beyond. It is an ancient remembering of Who We Really Are; an inner pathway to reconnecting with and finally unlocking our Healer Within, Higher Self, Inner Wisdom, God/Goddess), Divine Child Within - or whatever we choose to call our Divine Essence.\nThe moment we remember how to access and surrender to this spontaneous process, we start liberating ourselves physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually from the pain of lifetimes of trying to control our innate spontaneity, our environment and life itself. In SM we regain the spontaneity that we stifled when, as little children, we started trying to \u0093fit in\u0094 to a crazy adult world of pretence.\nIn Sacred Movement (SM) - which can be physical, emotional, mental (insights, information and inspiration), or spiritual - all previously perceived limitations fall away, we naturally set ourselves free from the need to control, and experience \u0093Something Bigger\u0094 showing us the way home.\nWe do not do SM, we allow it - and the moment we surrender, it spontaneously becomes an undoing of all that no longer serves us and we start dissolving all that is not Love and Light. Yet it is perfectly safe, for our Healer Within will not allow ourselves to hurt ourselves. Therefore the \u0093healing\u0094 or transformation that takes place during each session is incremental \u0096 to the exact extent that we are able to integrate. Whatever unfolds is whatever the priority is for us at that specific moment in time \u0096 which might be very different to what we \u0093think\u0094 it ought to be!\nAt times the moves may be purely physical as our skeleton, muscles, tendons realign so that our energy can flow more optimally. Sometimes these movements unblock stagnant energy that may rise to the surface as either heat or emotions; sometimes the experience is purely emotional (and vocal); at others purely spiritual; or purely informational. It may be a mix of any or all of these, which may move through us in waves. At other times there may be the experience of a deep-deep sleep-state, where the \u0093healing\u0094 is neurological. Therefore the experience is different for everyone - and different every time we enter it \u0096 and so it never becomes stagnant, it remains an adventure into the unknown. The last frontier!\nSM has, since it spontaneously blossomed in the Year 2000, revealed itself to have touch-points with spontaneous expressions of various forms of yoga (including tantra), body work, energy work, rebirthing and other processes, bellydance, trans-dance and other forms of movement, toning and other forms of voice-work, past-life recall and other shamanic practices. It is in essence a deep Remembering of what we all already know deep within our DNA-coding.\nEvery session incrementally increases the individual\u0092s energetic frequency \u0096 a slight tune-up to the extent that the individual is able to comfortably accommodate. Those who have experienced the discomfort of spontaneous Kundalini awakenings have found SM to bring back a deep sense of Grounding, Connecting and Balancing their energy. The practice of a specific series of \u0091GCB Moves\u0092 at the start and end of every sessions helps everyone achieve this.\nWith daily practice \u0096 which we soon start yearning for \u0096 Sacred Movement becomes a place where we can return to whenever we feel ungrounded, depleted, confused, upset (unloved), need \u0091healing\u0092 or a \u0091tune-up\u0092 of any kind \u0096 or whenever we are moved to give jubilant thanks! It is a place that is always available to us, in every moment in every day, wherever we are! The more we practice, the more we are able to sustain our Being Present in the outer world, and the more we witness the Presence of Love and Light in everyone and everything around us. Who would say no to that?\nIf your spirit says \u0093YES this is what I have been asking for\u0094 call Christina Nienaber-Roberts. She gently guides people to reconnect with this Sacred Gift in workshops and one -on-one consultations.

Suddenly it hit me; you CAN teach old dogs new tricks and help people change at the same time! (Crystal Pup would have definitely agreed!)\nBelieve it or not, training your dog is fun, healthy for both of you, and can even save his life! How many times have you seen a dog running down the street being chased by their owner who is screaming, \u0093ROVER! COME HERE!\u0094. What a grand game for the dog, yet what a dangerous game if he runs into traffic. Worse, yet again, what if you blindly follow him! Many dogs have died after being hit by a car and it could have been avoided if they were properly trained.\nMy story goes like this. A year and a half ago, my daughter was aware that her dog Ben (a two year old Lab cross) needed training. Like most people, she was not having success on her own. I had just signed up Pluto, (my five month old Heeler), in an obedience course, so they excitedly joined us.\nNow Ben really IS an excitable guy. He loves everyone, loves other dogs, loves to romp, loves to run and play. Within minutes of the first class, Ben was barking, romping and pulling on his lead, while another dog was snarling at him. My daughter was trying to hold him back and the trainer was barking out orders. My daughter was embarrassed, frustrated and close to tears. The whole thing was total chaos. The dog was pulled out of the class and measured for a prong collar. \u0093prong collars are meant to apply pressure around the neck by pinching the dog\u0092s skin together but can be extremely dangerous if not properly fitted and used by a professional.\u0092\nDue to my training in alternative health, I saw a number of things, in both humans and dogs that was not readily seen by other participants. I was shocked, at the emotional trauma, the pain and hurt of someone being shunned for the very reason they asked for help in the first place, not to mention the danger for the dog wearing a prong collar.\nThen, I realized three things\u0085one, in my belief system, ridicule and embarrassment is not a proper foundation for change and that includes dog\u0092s learning to interact with their owners; two, I already knew how to train a dog; and three, I could help others train their dogs in a relaxed calming setting! \u0093I\u0092m going to train dogs\u0094, I silently declared. Actually, my foundation was solidly in place, I just hadn\u0092t noticed. I had spent a lifetime teaching family and friends dog how \u0091to do things\u0092. I bred and trained Siberian Huskies, yet I never considered myself a trainer. This is an example of finding the pearl of wisdom in everything...the GIFT! As the New Year blossoms, I invite you to also be aware of the hidden talents you may have - waiting to be recognized!\nThe end result...I researched, studied, took some courses and finally created something to \u0091fill the gap\u0094 for other people like myself. I threw tradition aside, and created a mobile dog training business. Like people, dogs learn quicker in a relaxed atmosphere. Success is achieved quicker and everyone is happy! Most importantly, dog\u0092s lives are saved. Saved from the dangers of running into the street, saved from being named a \u0091bad\u0092 dog, saved from being sent to the SPCA because their owners feel their dogs are a lost cause or from being picked up \u0093at large\u0094 and put into a shelter.\nWe brought these wild animals into our homes and expect them to be as human as we are. We owe it to them to teach them how to be a part of our world. While we\u0092re at it, we should take a minute to offer gratitude to \u0091whatever name you give the Creator\u0092. Gratitude for having these wonderful, brilliant, funny, loving and entertaining animals in our lives.\nNancy Hedberg is a Professional Pet Dog Trainer / member of the Canadian Association of Professional Pet Dog Trainers.

It would look quite dashing along side my black velvet coat! OK...maybe I\u0092m going a bit to far here...but LOVE is in the air and vibration is the code word of the day... so why couldn\u0092t that bluebird and I vibrate together in harmony! I believe we can!\nVibration... wow, everywhere someone is talkin about vibration! Yahoo! It\u0092s about time we are finally talking the same language. I think I\u0092m going to teach a workshop on how to purrrrr! Think about it, why are cats generally so happy? It\u0092s hard to be grumpy when you are purring, and it activates your heart.\nI am rather fond of this attention on energy. People are looking into my eyes and listening to hear what I have to say. Holy white whiskers! This is a gigantic breakthrough. What a way to dissolve the communication barriers - what a way to spread LOVE. Take a look at my fancy photo up there...see that big white heart I wear on my chest. It\u0092s my inner spirit showing you how much I love you.\nAs you can see, I am precisely perched beside a big crystal bowl. I love them too, as you can see from the smile on my face. When the bowls start to play people think I will run off - not so. Actually when I\u0092m outside, I can feel them ringing and I run home on purpose.\nI also love to watch people become lighter and brighter when they sing. Sometimes I jump in, curl up and have a nap but a big guy like me has to be careful not to break things.\nWe had a neighbour cat once who used to come in my cat door and jump inside this bowl. He\u0092d run around in circles and ring it all by himself. He looked quite big but he was really all white and fluffy and really light - I think that\u0092s how he did it. Pity you couldn\u0092t train a cat to do that all the time. I\u0092ll have to talk to my friend Nancy, she trains dogs, maybe she could do something for us felines.\nI\u0092m showing you this crystal bowl so you remember to include your pets when you start being more vibrationally conscious. They\u0092ll love it. On the other hand some pets have sensitive ears and physical systems JUST LIKE YOU. Too much too often can be uncomfortable at first. Use caution - and NEVER put your pet in a bowl and ring it. NO NO NO. You would really hurt them. It is different if they do it gently themselves. Much different.\nSo if you want to join my purring class - send me an email. Heck, the pup sez, if you can teach an old dog new tricks, there\u0092s hope for you too! So don\u0092t be shy! Well, on that love-rly note, I\u0092m off to look for the bluebird. Love You!\nTable of Contents\nPower of Cells\nThe world we live in is complete with all the resources we need to sustain and achieve optimum health. It comes as no surprise, that natural sources provide powerful elements to assist our bodies in healing themselves one cell at a time.\nThe Amethyst Bio-Mat transmits the natural healing properties of the sun, the soothing healing elements of air and water and the power of the mineral kingdom. All this together in a mat you sleep on every night!\nThe Bio-Mat uses far-infrared light, negative ions and the healing power of amethyst and tourmaline crystals that act on our bodies \u0096 a combination that has become an FDA medical device in the United States.\nA cell consists of many components that work together, creating a harmonious movement of elements in and out of the cell. The health of these components determines a cell\u0092s ability to perform the functions it needs to sustain life and optimum health.\nThe interior and exterior environments of a cell differ in a variety of ways. For example, there is a difference in the content of positive sodium and potassium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. This difference creates an electrical potential between these two environments which is called a membrane potential. This potential is crucial in that it controls the movement of specific ions entering a cell and allowing acidic waste and other ions to exit the cell through the membrane\u0092s ionic channels.\nWhen our bodies suffer from disease, bodily malfunction or damage, it causes cells to be in a state of positive polarity. This imbalance affects a cell\u0092s ability to remove accumulated waste and thus prohibits its ability to receive needed nutrients.\nThe negative ions released from the Bio-Mat help reverse the polarity of cells\u0092 membrane potential to a negative state. Therefore, ionic channels are opened, waste exits and nutrients enter. Through this process, cellular communication and function is improved and the healing process begins. In addition to acting upon a cell\u0092s ionic channels, they also have a cleansing effect on the air and the body\u0092s cells; nature\u0092s way of \u0091cleaning things up\u0092.\nThe far-infrared light utilized in the Bio-Mat is a source of heat energy that works in balancing the cooling and cleansing effect of the negative ions. When we apply heat to the body we are increasing circulation, chemical break down, and the rate of nutrient, mineral and hormone distribution in the body via the blood system. The Bio-Mat delivers a long wave of far-infrared light that is able to penetrate the body to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. This light wave passes through skin, bones, muscle fibers, nerves, tissues and organs, delivering the required essential nutrients to all of these systems. The combination of the cooling qualities of the negative ions and the heating qualities of the far-infrared light, work together as a natural detoxification process.\nIt is a misconception that healing is the process of fixing old damaged cells. In reality, healing occurs when new healthy cells are produced. We reproduce every cell in our body in order to maintain the interrelated functions of our body. Therefore, when the correct elements and energy are available to produce new healthy cells, we are truly in the healing process.\nSo how does the Amethyst Bio-Mat create these natural energies? The Bio-Mat can be placed on your bed or your massage table. The controller attached to the Bio-Mat is then plugged into the wall. The Bio-Mat controller converts the alternating current from our outlets into a direct current that maintains a constant flow of electrons in a single direction from low to high potential. Because the alternating current has a magnitude and direction that varies above and below the current\u0092s threshold line, constantly wavering like what we see in fluorescent lights, the direct current is able to stabilize the needed energy source.\nAs the direct current travels to the surface of the Bio-Mat, it interacts with the mat\u0092s Carbonic Japanese Kurera Super Fibers (layer #9 - see ad below) creating a negatively charged potential field, due to the natural conductivity of carbon. When this negative potential is applied to our bodies, more calcium and sodium minerals are circulating in the blood stream. This process changes an acidified body to an alkaline body. The direct current continues to flow through the Bio-Mat and interacts with an additional layer called the Ceramic Japanese Kurera\u0092s Super Fiber (layer # 7). These fibers differ due to the ceramic\u0092s natural conductivity for the far-infrared light utilized by the Bio-Mat. When the farinfrared light hits the amethyst crystal located on the top of the mat, it changes the far-infrared light from a short wave to a long wave far-infrared light. As mentioned, the conversion from short to long waves of far-infrared light penetrates the deeper regions of the body.\nThe Amethyst Bio-Mat is a tool that can assist the body in healing itself using resources found in nature. Our bodies are extremely intricate and fascinating creations, with the full potential to achieve a natural state of health and wellbeing.\nTable of Contents\nCrystal Bowls\nWith the release of two wonderful movies \u0093What the Bleep\u0094 and \u0093The Secret\u0094, along with information about The Law of Attraction, most of us are starting to understand at a deep level that our thoughts and our personal rate of vibration create our reality. A basic law of physics states that like attracts like. When we think of ourselves as beings with energy fields, that our thoughts create vibrations, it is easier to understand why we get what we get in life. Our circumstances are a perfect match to what we resonate with; it is all in our vibrations.\nWhat can I do to increase my rate of vibration so I can enjoy more of the things I want in my life? While the obvious answer is to always think positive, I know from experience this isn\u0092t always easy.Those unconscious thoughts keep popping up in spite of my good intentions! Fortunately, there is another way of increasing vibration and that is through the application of sound into our energy fields with Crystal Singing Bowls. Combining the power of positive thought with the high vibrational tones of the crystal bowls, we increase our creative power exponentially. When I want to manifest something into my life, I go into a meditation and visualize that I already have it. As I begin to \u0093feel\u0094 that my creation is complete, I begin to play my bowl and imagine that the sound waves from the bowl and my thoughts are moving out into the universe, the high vibrational sound becomes the carrier wave for my intention.\nCrystal Bowls also work to heal us on a physical and emotional level as well. Our bodies are crystalline in structure and playing Crystal Bowls can have profound effects on the organs, cells, and skeletal structure bringing all systems into balance. The pure waves of sound that ring from the crystal bowls are angelic and enhance our ability to listen, hear and focus. Hearing occurs with more than our ears. Sound is vibration, and that vibration moves throughout our energy fields. With the crystal bowls, we can feel the sound as much as we hear it. The pure tones affect brain wave activity, and as different parts of the brain are affected, hormones and neuro-chemicals are released that suppress pain, overcome addictions, strengthen willpower, and enhance our creativity. Vibration also equals sound waves, and we can change the course of our lives through the application of sound into our energy fields with crystal singing bowls.\nLora Teuschler is a Certified Sound Healer and a Registered Karuna Reiki Master/Teacher call her at (250) 714-8358.\nTable of Contents\nImportance of Clarity\nAs this new year begins, be aware that the choices we make each day become more and more important\u0085not only to our souls, but to all of humanity, and to Mother Gaia. To make the choices best for our own soul development, and ultimately for humanity, we require Clarity.\nWithout Clarity we can not see when it is our own wounds speaking. Without Clarity we can not hear our own fears directing our lives & choices. Without Clarity we can not find our true purpose. Without Clarity we can not possibly make the best choices for our soul and our growth.\nHow is it we find Clarity? Is it a pill we take? A book we read? A mantra we chant? The next workshop or the next healer we find? Clarity is none of these. Clarity is found by listening, with our hearts open, to our God Presence, the deepest part of our soul. It is this inner voice that only speaks the truth.\nThe inner voice which only speaks from a place of love & forgiveness, never from a place of fear, revenge, anger or hatred. Clarity is the resonance of our soul to God/Goddess. It is the truth we all seek to hear and learn, a gift of wisdom from the heart, bringing forth the knowledge and experience from all your lifetimes.\nClarity comes from choosing the light, the love, and God/Goddess. It comes from divine service to the planet, during deep meditation when our heart opens and we hear with all our beingness, hear without expectations.\nClarity is the knowingness that only through \u0093surrender\u0094 can we be whole and truly guided. The knowingness that we create our own lives, the good, the \u0093bad\u0094 and everything in between. Clarity is the joy we find by making our choices from the heart and from love.\nClarity comes as we remove the veils which surround us and cloud our vision. It appears as we find the silence, allowing us to hear our God Presence - turn off the television, put down the newspaper, and shut off the computer. Clarity comes when we visit Mother Gaia, and feel the earth or water beneath our feet, and the wind on our face. When we stop focusing on all our \u0093wants\u0094 and are grateful for all in our life...Clarity comes!\nBeloveds, I AM Archangel Clarity. Please know I am always here to assist you. Call upon me, open your hearts - just listen, and know that when you ask, I will answer. Be sure to listen, even when it is not what you wish to hear.\nAs all of humanity continues to awaken and more choose a spiritual path, I offer you a gift. A gift to assist you with self clarity. Now Beloveds, if you wish... Take 3 deep, slow breaths, hold, and then slowly exhale, releasing all the tension from your body. Close your eyes, and state your intent to receive this gift.\nSee, feel or know that I come forward and place a golden liquid lovelight ring in your 3rd eye chakra. Feel it gently enter your 3rd eye, and spin clockwise, and then counter-clockwise as it activates. When your heart is open, this ring will assist you with selfclarity.\nKnow Beloveds, that the more open your heart, and the higher vibration of love you hold, the more clarity you will have. I urge you to make your choices from a place of love & clarity. Namaste, I AM Archangel Clarity.\nChannelled by Emissary of Love, AnaLaRai 250-752-5117 or laurie.sagle@sympatico.ca\nTable of Contents\nSage: A Messenger\u0092s Message\n\"In ancient times a SAGE was a messenger, delivering profound truths to an individual or a collective group\" ...

Where western doctors focus on symptoms, shamanic healers concentrate on the emotional, psychological and physical selves, acting as midwives for the process of achieving holistic health and harmony. Shamanic interventions can provide relief from long-standing emotional issues and behavioural patterns; restore natural energy by dispersing the heavy energy of an individual, group, building, or even a business.\nMany people think of healing as a quantum process; leaping from a state of illness to a state of health. While this phenomena can certainly occur, more often than not, the Great Spirit embarks us on a journey of incrementally recreating our minds, bodies and spirits. It has the power to recreate us at any given moment.\nDisease often manifests as a reflection of a contaminated mind. Our minds can create a paradigm of illness, accidents and injuries. Allowing and opening ourselves to the Creator to recreate within us a new paradigm of light and hope facilitates a reflection of health to then manifest in our lives.\nIn his classic book, The Way of the Shaman (Harper & Row) Michael Harner, PHD., tells us that shamans, \u0093are keepers of a remarkable body of ancient techniques that they use to achieve and maintain well-being and healing for themselves and their communities.\u0094\nThere are many South American shamanic interventions including the Illumination Process, Akashic Imprint Extractions, Despacho Ceremonies as well as Path Of Destiny Guidance. Some shamanic practitioners are trained in all of the above. Practitioners vary dramatically depending on who their teachers have been.Often it is necessary to travel to other parts of the world to connect with special teachers like: Ipupiara Peixoto of the Ure Wau Wau nation in the rainforests of Brazil; and Claicha Toscano of the Quechua nation in the Peruvian Andes or the late Wallace Black Elk - author of \u0093Black Elk- the Secret Ways of a Lakota.\u0094\nThe most vital component in shamanism is the practitioner\u0092s relationship to the Divine. This is the foundation of Power from which the shaman helps to facilitate health in the client. The shaman\u0092s primary function is to pray to the Great Spirit to bring health and help to the client. Without this foundation, the shaman is without true power to facilitate healing in anyone.\nThe shaman also teaches us how to reintroduce the Sacred into every aspect of our lives and communities. This helps us to become more in touch with our natural environments; bringing us balance, harmony and awareness.\nPrivate healing sessions with Kat McCooeye at (250) 752-0627 She says,\u0093It is an honour to provide this service to the public. All shamanic interventions and procedures are employed within Sacred Space, in accordance with Sacred Law. I am merely a facilitator, or conduit for the divine healing energy of the Creator.\nLIGHTonLIGHT\nSHINEing with LOVE from the INSIDE Out\nWe are the vibration of the 999 speaking to you through the energetic system of what you call the Grand Council of Light. We connect to you from the farthest reaches of the resonance of Light - from what some of you would equate with the vibration of \u0091home\u0092.\nIt was never our intention to be an active part in the project we call \u0091Transformation Planet Earth\u0092, although we were instrumental in its creation. Yet the integrity of love from your hearts beating as one, before the concept was a common word, inspired us to begin to direct activities of the highest sort on your behalf. Some will find an ancient comfort in these words...some will feel the sense of the power of this Now. We have been quietly monitoring your acivities for 15 of your earth years, carefully grooming the vibratory channels to this particular Island of Light and Love (Vancouver Island - one of 12 world power places - Keys of Enoch). We consider this the number of the 5+5+5 or simply put, the 555 vibration of miracles and healing.\nThere is no accident that this number should now align with 2007 in your time which many see to carry the vibration of the 777. Indeed it does and you will be amazed to discover what a gentle loving energy that is. But we remind you here at the beginning that this year of yours is also truly resonating a parallel vibration of the 999...where enlightened power and wisdom come together in service to the all. Hear what we say - in service! This great gift can only be used with loving integrity or it will simply dissipate...there is no room for misuse - only the complete trust for yourself and others who choose to cocreate with you.\nIt matters not if you were aware of our presence before this moment. We have no interest in what you call public recognition. Indeed we have preferred to be barely visible as it has facilitated the speed with which our assistance has been utilized and integrated on your planet. The path of resistance to our reigniting the energetic fields with love has been miniscule compared to what it may have been..all because we did little to draw attention to our mission. Some of you would be clever to consider this concept for yourself. You search for public recognition without fully contemplating how your lives would change if your wish was granted. The quiet privacy you treasure would all but disappear.\nSo many people seeking you out to assist them...glamourous perhaps but it takes a heart of great strength to master that test without becoming a slave to senseless self-adoration. Equality is the heartbeat of these times and those who have elevated themselves to the so-called higher ground will be surprised and perhaps uncomfortable as the pedestals begin to dissolve. Certainly there will always be a need for leaders and loving guides - whose intention is to assist you to empower yourselves. Perhaps an even greater need in these evolving times as many will begin to rise up from the ashes, like the great phoenix itself.\nThe concept of the Triad of Vibrations may stretch some of your minds, still we say to you, that the three: the 555/777/999 WILL create a symphony of sound, light and colour with those who feel the potential transformation of that pulse. These are indeed the days many of you have been waiting for. If you are to fully utilize this energetic space - we say again to note the importance of the water in your physical bodies and in all that is around you. Fill yourself up with an endless supply that you may clear the channels for what is to come. Gather together as you have in the past and Bless the Water of your world...that the crystalline structure may redefine itself to the original template. Bless each other and yourselves at every opportunity you can manifest. This is a critical acccellerator in your pursuit for freedom from the old ties that bind you. You are loved beyond your imagination, and the brilliance of The Light and Love from where we reside, is even greater than what some of you call \u0091neardeath experiences\u0092 like walking through the Window of Light and experiencing what you call God. Your human vessel is only capable of experiencing a small portion of that vibration, yet it is our intention to continue to assist you to feel MORE of that loving brilliance.\nYou ARE a crystalline being as we have spoken over and over for years of your time/no-time and you begin to feel this more and more. We say, when you allow your human brains to accept this truth you will discover this trinity of the 555/ 777/999 to be ultimately incredible. The crystals on your planet - the Master Stones of Transformation are ALL on Energertic Alert right Now...prepared to serve you at your request. They are dedicated to assisting you to speed up the vibration of the crystalline body within you, as they have for eons of your time but now - you are ready with hearts capable of holding the sacred patterns necessary for that vibration to expand in utmost clarity. These are the most exciting times the universe has ever seen and now many of you understand why you did not give up and go home when the opportunities presented themselves. You have all been tested and passed with flying colours whether you believe it or not. It is the reality that you are indeed still breathing on planet earth - that proves out point. There we watch you in all your brilliance - breathing in love, and breathing out love, from one side of mother earth to the other, and likewise through the very core of her.

Here, they do this Southern drink right. Watch in amazement as your bartender meticulously crushes a heaping handful of mint into your glass with a long prod, splashes on some top-shelf Kentucky bourbon and kisses it with just the right amount of sugar, suga. It's\u2026 More >>\nBest Barbecue Restaurant\nBurns Bar BQ\nOn Saturday afternoon, Burns Bar BQ is party central in Acres Homes. The crowds line up when the place opens, and they never let up until the ribs are gone. Burns Bar BQ serves their ribs well done under a sweet and subtle glaze of sauce and smoke. They're the best in the city. Patriarch Roy Burns grew up in\u2026 More >>\nBest Vintage Kolaches\nThe Original Kolache Shoppe\nCan't imagine hot coffee on Saturday morning without hot, gooey, fruit-filled kolaches? Then you owe an homage to the Original Kolache Shoppe. Fifty years ago, the fresh, doughy Czech pastries called kolaches were a treat you found in the homes of Eastern European immigrants and their ancestors, not in bakeries or restaurants. Beginning in 1956, this little East End bakery\u2026 More >>\nBest Cuban Restaurant\nCafe Miami\nThe huge awning outside this classic little joint on the southwest side announces that Cafe Miami is the \"King of Black Beans.\" In this town, that's no mean feat, and the fact is, the restaurant deserves the title. Also, try a basket of fried plantains and some yuca relish bathed in lime and cilantro. They will leave your taste buds\u2026 More >>\nBest Burger\nChristian's Tailgate Bar & Grill\nOnce, there was a convenience store with the wonderfully cryptic name \"Christian's Totem\" that was famous for its awesome burgers. Unfortunately, owner Steve Christian removed the convenience store shelves, expanded and renamed it Christian's Tailgate Bar & Grill. (A religious sports bar?) But lucky for us, Christian didn't screw up the burger. You get a hand-formed patty of never-been-frozen, freshly\u2026 More >>\nBest Place to Skip Dinner and Get to Dessert\nRuggles Cafe Bakery\nBruce Molzan has had a rough couple of years seeing his establishments at Minute Maid and downtown fold like...um, folding chairs or a deck of cards or something. But that doesn't mean he's lost it. We still think he has the best desserts in town. And while his hearty sandwiches and sweet potato fries are also a delight, we'd much\u2026 More >>\nBest Vintage Milk Shake\nYale Street Grill\nWith a five-station mixer constantly making shakes, malts and sundaes, the counter staffers at Yale Street Grill have their hands full. It is unknown whether they've been making shakes since 1923, when they opened, but the mixer sure looks the age. They start out with two or three generous scoops of Blue Bell ice cream, a good amount of milk\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in the Heights\nOnion Creek Coffee House\nThis is a pleasant, relaxing Heights-area spot that serves up tall cups of caffeine and pints of beer (not a short feat in this dry part of town) as patrons take in live music and DJs. At breakfast, loyal morning patrons inhale tasty croissants, bagels and kolaches, while lunchtime regulars wolf the phenomenal pizzas, \"country ass\" Reubens and delicious O.C.\u2026 More >>\nBest Onion Rings\nFleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar\nConversation momentarily ceases the moment the towering pyramid of onion rings hits your table at Fleming's. Then there's the hesitation: Do you dare disturb the architecture of the thickly sliced Vidalia onions and flaky, crunchy batter? Of course you do. This side dish is an excellent group treat, though you'll find you're muscling your way in past your tablemates to\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in Montrose\nBrasil\nWhile many Montrose cafes and coffee shops attract a fairly intriguing array of customers -- students with laptops, poets with notebooks, artists with sketchpads, wedding planners with engaged couples -- few provide as comfortable a place to just \"be\" as Brasil. And the food is no slack job, either. Stunning hummus pizza and mozzarella-tomato sandwiches delight. Wash them down with\u2026 More >>\nBest Salad\nRuggles Cafe Bakery\nCall it the salad for people who hate salads. The \"warm baked Texas goat cheese salad with apples and toasted almonds in a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette\" -- yes, this salad needs a nickname -- at Ruggles Cafe Bakery seems like an hors d' oeuvres tray on a bed of lettuce. A thick, fat slab of goat cheese caked in sliced\u2026 More >>\nBest Comfort Food\nCleburne Cafeteria\nDishes like roast beef, chicken-fried steak and mac 'n' cheese rarely grace the cover of Gourmet magazine, but they're at the epicenter of the collective American palate. And you'll be hard-pressed to find a place that serves better versions of these favorites than Cleburne Cafeteria. The lines form early and snake out the door here daily as West University locals\u2026 More >>\nBest Steak Frites\nLaurier Cafe\nSure, you can get steak and fries at any steak house in the city, but Laurier Cafe's version is this town's best offering of the Parisian bistro classic. It starts -- as it always should -- with the steak, a glorious, 12-ounce Niman Ranch New York strip (Niman Ranch beef comes from cattle that are custom-fed and hormone-free). The steak\u2026 More >>\nBest Greek Restaurant\nMykonos Island\nWith its big open windows and lush plants, Mykonos Island seems plucked from its namesake spot in Greece. Try the Greek sampler platter, which offers traditional appetizers like meatballs and stuffed grape leaves. True to Greek island cuisine, psari (seafood) reigns supreme here, with fish like grouper and snapper arriving fresh daily. The snapper dishes are served full-fish -- head,\u2026 More >>\nBest Sushi\nOsaka Japanese Restaurant\nIt's the dish that sushi lovers and aficionados test any spot by: toro, or fatty tuna. Specifically, it's the cut of fatty meat along the fish's belly. A bad cut yields junk; a precise cut offers perfectly marbled flavor and a buttery texture. You'll never be disappointed by the toro at Osaka Japanese Restaurant, which serves the market's best tuna\u2026 More >>\nBest Mexican Restaurant\nHugo's\nDid Hugo Ortega know he was creating the most cutting-edge Mexican food in town when he opened his eponymous restaurant? Or was he simply paying homage to the diversity and culinary gifts of his homeland? Either way, he's at the forefront of 21st-century Mexican cuisine -- both locally and nationally. First-timers can expect to be challenged and surprised by the\u2026 More >>\nBest Vintage Martini\nWarren's Inn\nBack when NoDo was just called downtown, and before Main Street had a rail system -- or even more than one nightclub -- there was Warren's Inn. And there was the venerable Jose Serna, one of this city's most memorable, classy and distinguished bartenders. For more than 30 years, Serna, clad in white shirt and black bow tie, served politicians,\u2026 More >>\nBest Middle Eastern Restaurant\nFadi's\nBetween the tangy Lebanese salad, fragrant tabbouleh, fluffy dill rice and creamy hummus, your plate is already full as you navigate the a la carte line at Fadi's. As you eye the offerings, you're given the choice of lamb, chicken of beef kebabs that arrive to your table sizzling, juicy and grilled to perfection. Or order the baked chicken, a\u2026 More >>\nBest Loroco Dishes\nCharivari Restaurant\nWe first tasted the Central American green flower bud called loroco a couple of years ago. It's picked wild in El Salvador and has an intriguing flavor that's something of a cross between asparagus and chocolate. Up until now, at Houston pupuserias, we could sample only the frozen variety. Evidently, importing the fresh plant is now approved by the USDA,\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in Rice Village\nbenjy's\nWith its artsy, brushed-aluminum tabletops, pastel walls and teardrop lighting fixtures, benjy's looks every bit the swank hangout -- and it is. There's a separate upstairs lounge, and downstairs there's Benjy Levit's serious modern American cuisine. Chill on the comfy booths while you spy on Inner Loop scenesters, West U families and up-and-coming Rice kids. Sip on wasabi Bloody Marys\u2026 More >>\nBest Cheeseburger\nStanton's Super Market\nThe plainest burger on the menu at this rundown convenience store is the best bacon cheeseburger in the city. Get it \"all the way,\" and savor your half-pound, hand-formed beef patty on an oversize well-toasted sesame-seed bun topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, red onions, two strips of bacon and an ample amount of American cheese. Variations include the\u2026 More >>\nBest Place to Bring Your Dog\nBarnaby's\nThe teacup toy poodles and rat-size Chihuahuas peer at each other from their owners' purses. Stately Dobermans and German Shepherds mingle with crack-addict-hyper Jack Russell terriers. Posh Weimaraners that could model for Wegman stare down their long noses at bandanna-clad, all-American golden retrievers. It's a veritable dog show on the porch of Barnaby's River Oaks location, which is fitting, considering\u2026 More >>\nBest Nachos\nSpanish Flowers\nWhen some folks think of nachos, they think of the plastic tub full of Tostitos and Cheez Whiz served up at places like Minute Maid Park. But to merely place cheese on a chip is practically a crime; those fried little tortillas can hold so much more. The Spanish Flowers nachos take top billing at this all-night haunt on the\u2026 More >>\nBest Seafood Restaurant\nClary's Seafood Restaurant\nThe seafood at this Galveston hideaway is absolutely sublime. But it's the picture window in the dining room that elevates Clary's above its mainland competitors. Through the window you can watch the pelicans and seagulls circle a glistening shrimp boat tied up at a tiny dock on Offats Bayou. The boat just in from fishing, its nets are stretched out\u2026 More >>\nBest Pho\nVan Loc\nYou know the drill. Semi-fatty discs of medium-rare beef stewed with chicken broth, pork bits and glass noodles in a steaming bowl as big as your head. You're eating pho -- the incomparable Vietnamese soup that'll make you wonder aloud why those cartoon kids on the Campbell's cans look so friggin' happy. For real bite, throw in a few of\u2026 More >>\nBest Breakfast\nGorditas Aguascalientes\nThe breakfast tacos at Gorditas Aguascalientes include eggs with carne deshebrada, ham, bacon, chorizo and potatoes, and they're all built on handmade flour tortillas. The sensational chilaquiles, which are served on the side of the huevos rancheros, are made with dark chile sauce and white cheese. Don't miss the machacado, a popular northern Mexican breakfast made with eggs and dried\u2026 More >>\nBest Sake\nZake Lounge\nWarm rice wine isn't for everyone. In general, true connoisseurs like it cold -- especially on a hot Friday night in Houston while a DJ spins Japanese house music. The staffers rock at this ultra-hip sushi bar, and they won't mind letting you taste their many different types of sake. The top sake also has the best name, the Poochie-Poochie\u2026 More >>\nBest Sommelier\nAntonio Gianola\nSommeliers are often judged by how much profit they bring in. And the way to turn a big profit is to sell expensive wines. So the average Houston sommelier loads up the wine list with overpriced bottles and then tries to sell them with snob appeal. Italian wines are the worst. To hear the service staff at some Houston restaurants\u2026 More >>\nBest Tamales\nDona Tere\nWhile the average itinerant tamale peddler charges five or six bucks a dozen, Dona Tere's go for $1 apiece. It only sounds expensive -- the tamales at Dona Tere are Mexico City-style tamales that are around four times as big as Tex-Mex tamales. They're also more imaginatively stuffed. The tamales filled with pork and green chile sauce are outstanding. So\u2026 More >>\nBest Bistro\nMockingbird Bistro\nAward-winning chef and owner John Sheely is back behind the stove of his self-dubbed American-Provencal bistro. Despite a gothic interior left over from the previous owners that doesn't give the place a bistro feel, the food is innovative and always superb. He is turning out such bistro staples as steak frites, a fabulous foie gras, mussels, croque monsieurs and a\u2026 More >>\nBest Shish Kebab\nCafe Lili\nThree different kebabs are available here: beef, chicken and kafta. The beef and kafta are the best. All are served with a rice pilaf, pita bread and hummus or a salad. The skewered beef kebab has small cubes of prime filet interspersed with onion. The chopped raw onions and cilantro, which sit on top of the kebab, add additional tastes,\u2026 More >>\nBest Chinese Restaurant\nFung's Kitchen\nWhen Asian dignitaries visit Houston, they are most often entertained at our finest Chinese restaurant, Fung's Kitchen. The palatial red-and-gold dining room can expand to accommodate over a thousand diners. The 400-item menu includes such exotica as thousand-year-old eggs, seaweed salad and pork-blood squares. And when it comes to Cantonese seafood, you can't beat the place. The whole ling cod\u2026 More >>\nBest Stinky Tofu\nChina Gourmet\nClose your nose and open your eyes. Served atop a flame on a silver platter, the \"double spicy stinky bean curd\" at China Gourmet is beautiful. A steaming tofu mountain flowers with mustard leaves, leeks, jalapenos and garlic slices, all surrounded by a red moat of pepper sauce. It's almost enough to make you forget that it smells just like\u2026 More >>\nBest Expense-Account Restaurant\nPappas Bros. Steakhouse\nIf you're into testosterone-induced bragging of the \"mine is bigger than yours\" sort -- referring, of course, to expense accounts -- then this is the perfect place to show what you've got. In a wonderful atmosphere reminiscent of the art deco era, you can impress that important client and easily drop a C-note per person with dishes including the jumbo\u2026 More >>\nBest Mojito\nP.F. Chang's China Bistro\nWhat exactly is an Asian pear? We're not sure, but we'll take Asian pears over the regular garden-variety any day if they taste as good as they do in the mojitos at P.F. Chang's. This twist on the popular cocktail will make you want to dig poor Papa Hemingway's body up out of the ground so he can get a\u2026 More >>\nBest Soul Food Restaurant\nJust Oxtails Soul Food\nJust Oxtails Soul Food is modestly named and modestly situated in a corrugated metal building next to a church and a biker bar. It easily lives up to its name, offering divine oxtails, which are tender and drenched in an addictive, slightly sweet gravy. But that's not the only reason the line inside stretches ten deep late into the afternoon.\u2026 More >>\nBest Oysters\nGilhooley's Raw Bar\nGilhooley's is Misho Ivic's favorite restaurant. And since Misho is the owner of Misho's Oysters, one of the largest oyster processors in Texas, he personally picks his best bivalves to be sent to the restaurant. In the winter, when the oysters are sweet and plump, the ones at Gilhooley's are always just a little sweeter and just a little plumper.\u2026 More >>\nBest Family Restaurant\nLupe Tortilla's\nKids can run rampant at this family-friendly Tex-Mex joint located in an old house just off the Katy Freeway, with a large outside seating area and open-air bar. Since the wait can be excessive, the owners built a sandbox for the little ones to play in, and they invariably bring the sand, toys and anything else they can get their\u2026 More >>\nBest Plantain Chips\nAmazon Grill\nThe plantain chips at the Amazon Grill are long -- the entire length of a plantain -- as well as thick, crispy and golden. There are lots of them, and best of all they're free. You can choose from two dipping sauces; one's a chimichurri (parsley, olive oil and garlic), the other a mango, and both of them are wonderful.\u2026 More >>\nBest Jamaican Restaurant\nTropical Grill\nAt this cozy little cottage, the chef is also the waiter, and all the food tastes homemade. Chef Neville Monteith grew up in rural East Portland, Jamaica, not far from the Boston Beach jerk shacks and the Port Antonio banana plantations. After training at the famous Trident resort hotel on the island, he cooked at top U.S. luxury hotels like\u2026 More >>\nBest Pupusas\nEl Cuscatleco Cafeteria\nIf there is a little El Salvador in Houston, it's on Bissonnet. Hell, there's a \"Little Everywhere\" along that endless stretch of road. Several pupusarias coexist in the 6000s or so, but this one ranks the highest with its yummy little Salvadoran street snack, the pupusa. The hole-in-the-strip-mall El Cuscatleco serves pupusas hot and fresh off the griddle, stuffed with\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in the Southwest\nJava Cup\nOne of Houston's more intriguing shopping centers is located near West Bellfort and Chimney Rock, where Westbury Square tries, as it has for 30 years, to stay alive. The center's New Orleans feel -- brick paving, porches, a fountain -- is so strong that Infernal Bridegroom Productions once staged a Tennessee Williams play outdoors there. There's no better place to\u2026 More >>\nBest Salsa\nJarro Cafe\nSalsa is like beer: Some people timidly nip it, and others suck in the buzz. If salsa to you means getting lit, then thank the devil for Jarro Cafe, the flame-licked answer to the icehouse. Here, you'll get a salsa six-pack. Each of six brightly colored bowls offers a different, painfully delicious temptation. Try the chopped purple onions mixed with\u2026 More >>\nBest Thai Restaurant\nVieng Thai\nThe hot larb salad with lime-juice-drenched ground beef tossed with chopped chiles, scallions, onions, mint and cilantro is electrifying. The drunken noodles -- slick with lime juice, piquant with chiles and aromatic with purple basil -- are spectacular. The milky-looking tom kha gai is a seductively gentle-looking chicken soup that turns devilishly spicy on your palate with blazing chiles and\u2026 More >>\nBest Vintage Enchiladas\nLarry's Original Mexican Restaurant\nYou may think you prefer authentic Mexican enchiladas made with imported queso, but that's only because you haven't eaten at Larry's lately. Sure, the American cheese-filled enchiladas here are relics of the 1960s. But the truth is Larry's old-fashioned cheese enchiladas taste better than those earnest enchiladas made with real cheese. Only processed American cheese will melt into those viscous\u2026 More >>\nBest Vegetarian-Friendly Restaurant\nHunan Village Restaurant\nAt Hunan Village, you can order veggie substitutes so amazingly similar to the real deal, you'll swear you're being fooled with. Take the sesame \"chicken.\" We defy you to bite into a big chunk of its sweet, dark, chewy mass and deny it's the same stuff Colonel Sanders is serving up the road. The \"pork\" fried rice will have you\u2026 More >>\nBest Vintage Fried Chicken\nBarbecue Inn\nBarbecue Inn is frozen in time. At this place, it's still 1946. Just take a look at the menu, and sample some of its old-fashioned East Texas diner cuisine. Some people come here just for the chunky french fries. Others adore the old-fashioned stainless-steel merry-go-round of sour cream, bacon bits, green onions and cheese that comes with every baked potato.\u2026 More >>\nBest Vegetarian Indian Restaurant\nMadras Pavilion\nMadras Pavilion is popular with Gujaratis, South Indians and other vegetarian denizens of the subcontinent, but never mind the wisdom of Lord Krishna -- the real reason to go is because the food is heavenly. The palak paneer is the most perfectly spiced in the city. Filled with onions and potatoes, many of the 13 varieties of dosai look less\u2026 More >>\nBest Bloody Mary\nGriff's\nEveryone is so darn picky. More Worcestershire, not enough Tabasco, blah, blah, blah. When it comes to making the perfect Bloody Mary, chances are you know your own tastes better than anyone else. That's what makes Griff's Sunday Bloody Sundays such a revolution. They pour a top shelf shot of vodka over ice for you just before sending you off\u2026 More >>\nBest Brunch\nHilton Post Oak\nThis one wins for sheer variety. One of the last all-you-can-eat brunch buffets, it's a feast for the eyes and the belly. With well over 100 feet of offerings, the Hilton Post Oak brunch should satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. A good strategy is to bring the Sunday paper and linger over the bottomless champagne or mimosas. Salmon, stone\u2026 More >>\nBest Breakfast Tacos\nNaomi's Tacos\nThe humble Naomi's Tacos excels in the breakfast-taco arena. You can order yours made-to-order in as many combinations as your mind can muster -- and you better believe they've got homemade tortillas. The owners of this modest, five-table taqueria hand-prepare the dishes themselves. If that's not enough to convince you that you're eating your morning meal with the best of\u2026 More >>\nBest Creole Restaurant\nBrennan's of Houston\nExecutive chef Randy Evans is putting his signature on Brennan's menu with some ambitious new dishes and a fresh spirit of inventiveness. The Creole food served here is a culinary subgenre that Brennan's calls Texas Creole. Derivative of New Orleans Creole cooking, the food here is the kind you'll find at old-line restaurants in the Crescent City such as Galatoire's.\u2026 More >>\nBest Cheap Sandwich\nCali Sandwich & Fast Food\nDelicious and inexpensive banh mi (Vietnamese mainstays jam-packed into classic French baguettes) can be found all over our fair city, but Cali brings the art of the cheap eat to new and awe-inspiring levels. A mind-boggling $2 buys you a big ticket to taste country. A foot-long, warmed baguette is stuffed with pickled carrots and onions, slathered in rich, homemade\u2026 More >>\nBest Drive-Thru\nEl Rey Taqueria\nIn the battle to rule the drive-thru, the best weapon is smoke. A rich, heavy cloud of it floats across Washington Avenue every afternoon from El Rey, a small Cuban/Mexican restaurant that attracts a fleet of loyal subjects. They come for the chicken, which is skewered and baked for hours to golden perfection. On the side, red and green salsas\u2026 More >>\nBest Chicken-Fried Steak\nHickory Hollow\nStringy, sinewy cuts of second-rate cow bathed in a blanket of pasty flour can come dangerously close to high school cafeteria levels in some joints. Cookie the trail-hand cowboy cook would be downright offended by some of the versions being rustled up. Not so at Hickory Hollow, where they truly know how to keep the wagons happy. Generous, thick portions\u2026 More >>\nBest Greasy Spoon\nDot Coffee Shop\nWhy are the best greasy spoons always by the airport? Open 24 hours, Dot is off I-45 just down from Hobby. At times, it seems like the entire restaurant and everything in it -- including the hardworking waitstaff -- is covered in a thin layer of grease. Everything comes in hefty portions, and daily specials include fried catfish and pot\u2026 More >>\nBest Croissants\nThe French Gourmet Bakery\nThis patisserie rocks the chateau. The almond croissants are thick and rich -- a dieter's nightmare. But live a little. Indulge in this buttery, flaky pastry topped with slivered almonds and stuffed to the seams with frangipane, the creamy almond filling. Heaven. Late sleepers might miss out on these because they often sell out. Run, don't walk.\u2026 More >>\nBest Indian Restaurant\nRestaurant Indika\nThe food at Indika is on a par with the fare served at the most innovative Indian restaurants in the United States. And unlike imaginative Indian chefs like Floyd Cardoz at Tabla in New York, Indika's chef and owner, Anita Jaisinghani, doesn't do fusion. Hence her menu, while impressively creative, isn't contrived. The Maple Leaf Farms duck tandoori in a\u2026 More >>\nBest French Fries\nCafe Montrose\nAhhh, potatoes, hot grease and salt -- the simple equation made so complex by so many. They aren't all that hard to make, so how do many places manage to screw up french fries? You know the problems: too greasy, oversalted, heat-lamp limp. That's why the Belgian eatery Cafe Montrose deserves mad, starchy props for its fries. Crispy, golden-brown exteriors\u2026 More >>\nBest Korean Restaurant\nGreen Pine Tree Bar & Grill\nGreen Pine Tree Bar & Grill looks a little like a Korean speakeasy. There's a neon-lit sushi bar on one side of the room and a half-dozen dining nooks with semi-secluded tables on the other. The attractive dining room in between features two rows of tables separated by a room-length divider and a sparkling mirrored column. These are the best\u2026 More >>\nBest Fried Chicken\nFrenchy's\nSince 1969, Frenchy Cruzot has been consistently supplying the best Creole fried chicken in Houston. He's also been turning out the tastiest greens, the most satisfying andouille-studded red beans and rice, and some of the best dirty rice and jambalaya the city has ever known -- all sold in Styrofoam to-go containers for a veritable pittance. Frenchy, who is an\u2026 More >>\nBest Late-Night Restaurant\nLate Nite Pie\nIt's late, and you're shit-canned. You need something to soak up all the booze in your belly so you can get home. Do yourself a favor and skip the drunken lovefest at \"House of Guys.\" Instead, head to this seedy Montrose eatery. We love Late Nite Pie for the simple fact that the menu lists a pizza called the Stanky\u2026 More >>\nBest Taqueria\nLaredo Taco Place\nLaredo Taco Place isn't much to look at from the outside, but the inside is decorated with metates and colorful pinatas. The waitress will scoop out cups of red and green salsas for you from two large ceramic bowls. Order from a substantial, cafeteria-style spread of Tex-Mex taco fillings, which includes a half-dozen styles of eggs in the morning, and\u2026 More >>\nBest Mac 'n' Cheese\n17\nThe French consider Mornay to be a mother sauce for a reason: It's darn good. People used to the powdered, boxed macaroni and cheese may not understand, but one forkful of 17's delicious truffled variety makes us moan. Fat chunks of blue cheese, a hearty handful of real Parmigiano-Reggiano, notes of Gruyere and hints of regular old cheddar blend nicely\u2026 More >>\nBest Pizzeria\nRomano's Italian Restaurant\nThe fabled pizzerias of the East Coast -- the tiny smoky places with aged ovens and dusty pictures of wrestler Bruno Sammartino on the walls -- are nowhere to be found in Houston. But if you take away the bright, airy feel -- and, please, the \"Take-Ah De Order Here\" pidgin-Italian signs -- Romano's comes pretty darn close. The thin-crust\u2026 More >>\nBest Margarita\nTeotihuacan Mexican Cafe\nOn a blazingly hot afternoon when you were but a wee Houstonian, nothing could satisfy like the one and only ICEE. Fast-forward 20 years, and the grown-up Texan's frozen treat of choice has to be the margarita. We've found the perfect place to satisfy your craving: Teotihuacan (\"tay-o-tee-hwa-KAHN\"). The price is nice ($2 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Mondays\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in Bellaire\nNick's Pasta Place\nWhile Houstonians are lucky to have lots of high-end authentic Italian restaurants, we are equally blessed to have the free garlic bread and large Caesar salads at family-friendly little nooks like Nick's. The Italian-American cuisine here doesn't aim very high, but it seldom misses. The linguine pescatore, a huge bowl of pasta with shrimp, squid, chopped clams and mussels in\u2026 More >>\nBest Catfish\nSoul on the Bayeaux\nThere's an art to frying great catfish so that it's greaseless and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy on the inside. It also should be mild in flavor with no swampy taste. At Soul on the Bayeaux, they use a Cajun-spiced cornmeal batter that gives the fish a nice little kick. When the catfish is this good, there's\u2026 More >>\nBest Neighborhood Spot in Galveston\nLeo's Cajun Corner\nReal Galvestonians don't give a damn about tourist restaurants in restored Victorians. They don't fret over finding a tabletop view of the beach. Their folk is bayou folk, and just about the last down-home, real Galveston spot left on this island ain't scenic. It's a red-and-white shack surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and a giant parking lot. And it serves\u2026 More >>\nBest Ceviche\nLemon Tree\nThe owners of Lemon Tree are Peruvian, and ceviche -- raw seafood pickled in lemon juice -- is considered the national dish of Peru. And they know how to make it here. You can get either plain fish or a seafood mixture consisting of fish, shrimp, mussels and calamari served with thin slices of onion and finely chopped peppers known\u2026 More >>\nBest New Restaurant\nNoe Restaurant & Bar\nCelebrity chef Noe Robert Gadsby made the big splash of the year with the opening of the Houston Noe, the sister restaurant of the original in Los Angeles, which is located in another Omni Hotel. Gadsby runs both of his playful, challenging restaurants with a whimsical touch. He defines his highly original cooking style as progressive American or Franco-Japanese, but\u2026 More >>\nBest Dim Sum\nFung's Kitchen\nThe jellyfish salad and the ducks' tongues whizzing by on the dim sum carts look exotic. But it's the dumplings at Fung's Kitchen that are extraordinary. Sure, the shrimp ones and the xiu mai are excellent, but how about dumplings filled with chopped snow-pea shoots and garnished with peas and carrot cubes? Owner and head chef Hoi Fung comes from\u2026 More >>\nBest Restaurant\nT'afia\nIf your definition of a great restaurant is a posh dining room where airhead waiters suck up to rich people, try the new Tony's, or one of Tilman Fertitta's high-end swank-aterias. But if you want to visit the epicenter of Houston's food scene, go to T'afia, the minimalist restaurant in Midtown where the service is informative, not kiss-ass.

Many thanks to all of you who left me good wishes via email and Facebook .\nA few weeks ago I started feeling a dull pain in my elbow. A week later, I had pretty severe pain in my neck. Soon after, the pain radiated from my neck, through my shoulders, down my arm, and into my fingers. Finally, it was accompanied by occasional numbness and a feeling that my elbow was on fire.\nOver a few weeks, I was in so much pain that I couldn\u2019t think straight!\nFirst Stop\nFirst stop on the road to wellness, I went to a conventional physician \u2013 a new one because we have new health insurance. \u00a0She evaluated me for 2 minutes or so (no kidding) and told me I had nondescript pain in my neck and shoulders, with fairly severe tennis elbow. \u00a0Then she gave me a referral to physical therapy. \u00a0And that was it.\nSecond Stop\nI promptly called physical therapy, and they told me I couldn\u2019t see one person for those three different things: they had a neck and shoulders physical therapist, and an elbow therapist \u2013 I\u2019d have to see both. \u00a0And the next available appointment was 1 week away for the neck and shoulders, and 3 weeks away for the elbow. \u00a0Oh, and they were in two different locations.\nTrying to explain that my neck bone was connected to my shoulder bone, and shoulder bone is connected to the elbow bone\u2026 didn\u2019t work. Nope, there wasn\u2019t anyone who could do that.\nI was in so much pain my eyes were tearing, I was grumpy, and I was having real difficulty concentrating on my work. \u00a0The only time the pain subsided at all was if I was lying in bed in one particular position. And here I was faced with another 3 weeks of this sharp, radiating pain before comfort was even in sight.\nThird Stop\nSo I made an appointment with my Naturopathic Doctor . \u00a0He saw me just 2 days later.\nInstantly Kevin sensed I was in a lot of pain. \u00a0He spent 1/2 hour with me, learning exactly what was going on \u2013 by talking, moving and feeling my joints, and testing my strength and mobility.\nHis diagnosis: \u00a0Nerve pain in my neck. \u00a0I have a bad disc in my neck, that was probably injured back when I was in a car accident long ago and has now been re-injured. Ah, I realized, I\u2019ve had tingling in my fingers for a long time.\nAt the same time, I managed also to get tennis elbow \u2013 probably from hyperextending my arms in my new yoga practice. \u00a0So the two injuries were aggravating one another. \u00a0(Because the neck bone is connected to the shoulder bone\u2026 and so on.)\nKevin gently and carefully adjusted my neck and back. He gave me exercises. And pharmaceuticals (at that point I was ready). And specific vitamin supplements \u2013 for short-term and long-term healing. And orders to rest and ice as often as possible. And orders to make my desk even more ergonomic than it already is. \u00a0And to modify my yoga postures when I go back to yoga.\nThat was 2 weeks ago. I am finally able to concentrate for a full day at work. \u00a0Though I still get awfully tired \u2013 I have a difficult time getting up in the morning and I\u2019m ready to go home by 4pm, exhausted. The pain is still there but it\u2019s not mind-numbing anymore.\nThe Abyss Of Pain\nI\u2019m sure some of you have been to this place: the abyss of pain. \u00a0It\u2019s a cloudy-headed, self-absorbed, cranky and impatient, dark hole of dispair and disrepair. \u00a0In that abyss, your brain can really only focus solidly on the immediate needs before you.\nHave you been there?\nIt\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m lucky that the people around me understand, support and forgive me.\nIf \u00a0you ever find yourself in that abyss, first be sure to tell others around you what you\u2019re going through \u2013 otherwise they won\u2019t know, can\u2019t support you, and might be less willing to forgive you for your impatience. And second, be sure to advocate for yourself until you get the care you need to overcome the pain.\nNow it\u2019s like a fog is lifting.\u00a0I can write again. I can see the bigger picture again \u2013 the bigger picture of life, of business , of the planet\u2026\nHello again.\n25 Ways I've Improved My Asthma\nI just received a really lovely email from Liz, who was recently hospitalized for asthma.\u00a0 Sick in bed, she was clicking around the internet and found us by following a link to How To Plant, Grow, & Prune Blueberries .\u00a0 Liz, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re sick!!\nIn her email, Liz asked what I\u2019ve done to try to get off my own asthma medications.\u00a0 I spent the whole walk home yesterday thinking about all the many things I\u2019ve done over the past couple of years!\u00a0 So I thought some of you might benefit from this, or know someone who has asthma and might benefit.\nMy husband, who doesn\u2019t have asthma, has benefited from many of these changes as well \u2013 he says he\u2019s not sick as often, he gets headaches less, he\u2019s less stuffy in his nose, and his sense of smell has vastly improved!\nBrief History of My Asthma\nI was very sick as a child \u2013 every fall through spring I had a serial illnesses of bronchitis, ear infections, sinus infections, mononucleosis, strep throat, respiratory flus, colds,\u2026 it was pretty miserable.\u00a0 At that time, people recognized wheezing as the only major symptom of asthma \u2013 rather than what I had, which was uncontrollable coughing and gasping for breath.\u00a0 If you want to know how it feels, I even made a short film about it !\nSo I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until I was in college.\u00a0 And boy, my world changed!\u00a0 Suddenly I had enough oxygen on a daily basis \u2013 my mind was clearer, I was sick a little less often, and my posture improved a bit (asthmatics tend to hunch over their chest).\nWhen I moved to New York several years later, it got worse.\u00a0 My doctor at the time said that was normal, and added more medications.\u00a0 A few years later, I moved to LA.\u00a0 Of course it got worse.\u00a0 My low point was taking high doses of steroids, 7 daily medications, and STILL uncontrollably coughing and gasping for breath.\nSomething needed to change.\u00a0 So over the last four years or so, I\u2019ve slowly made lifestyle changes that have got me down to just two medications (at the lowest possible doses), with an occasional rescue inhaler (used every few months).\u00a0 I\u2019ve been sick twice in the last three years.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\nMy goal is to go off all my medications by the end of the year.\u00a0 Catching a terrible bug going around just recently has set me back a tad, but I\u2019m moving forward again.\nA Word of Caution\nBe careful.\u00a0 Listen to your body.\u00a0 Listen to your doctors.\nI am not a doctor, I am only writing about what works for me.\u00a0 Please take what you can on your road to finding what works for you.\nAnd above all, remember that the most important thing is for your asthma to be under control.\u00a0 It\u2019s ok to be a bit cautious, because out of control asthma takes a long time to recover from \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t feel right to make a change, don\u2019t risk it.\u00a0 Take your time.\u00a0 It will get better.\n25 Ways I\u2019ve Improved My Asthma\nRemove all toxic and fragrant products from your home. I may not be starting with a small one for some of you, but this is where I started.\u00a0 Shampoos, soaps, detergents, floor cleaners, carpet sprays, window cleaners\u2026 all of it.\u00a0 Replace them with very natural versions (no artificial scents, and preferably no scents) or make them yourself .\nNo fragrances or toxins on the body. It was hard for me to give up perfume, but I did.\u00a0 It is incredible how much of a difference it made.\u00a0 Lotion \u2013 find the most natural, non-fragrant one you can find. Deodorant .\u00a0 Bath oils\u2026 you get the picture.\u00a0 This is not about deprivation, it\u2019s about getting healthy and staying that way!\u00a0 You\u2019ll get used to it.\nExercise regularly. Every day if possible.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t have to be strenuous, just get the warm air going through your lungs.\u00a0 In the winter, wear a scarf and put it over your mouth and nose to keep the air warm. I walk to work every day , about 2.5 miles round trip.\nLearn about asthma. Learn how it works \u2013 it\u2019s fascinating and useful; learn what to look for in a trigger; learn what medications there are (your physician may not know all the answers).\u00a0 I started with Asthma for Dummies (I know, but it really is helpful).\u00a0 Talk to your doctor as much as he or she will let you.\nReduce stress. Or Increase calmness.\u00a0 Maybe a little of both.\u00a0 Take it as it comes.\u00a0 Learn to say no.\u00a0 Be ok with staying home if you\u2019re tired and need a little \u201cme\u201d time.\nBe the master of your own medical plan. I had to make my own appointment to see a pulmonologist \u2013 nobody referred me.\u00a0 It was one of the first catalysts for getting my asthma back on track.\u00a0 Now I\u2019ve gone so far as to see a naturopath and do acupuncture.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not all.\u00a0 You and only you know when you need an increase or decrease in medication. You know.\u00a0 You know when it\u2019s time to try a different medication or doctor because one isn\u2019t quite working.\u00a0 You have to ask, you have to keep track, you have to read up, you have to know your body better than anyone else, and you have to advocate for you.\nFind your triggers and get rid of them. In my home, I found that I\u2019m allergic to wool, latex, and sesame oil \u2013 along with dust mites of course.\u00a0 It took a while to figure those out!\u00a0 I had to really pay attention to what was making me cough.\nCover your pillows, mattresses, and duvets. Dustmite covers are all over now \u2013 you can buy them really cheaply at Target, or get expensive organic ones that last forever online.\u00a0 I recommend not getting the super cheap plastic ones, as the fumes from the plastic are pretty bad.\nWash your hands. That\u2019s an easy one \u2013 yay!\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to feel a little crazy at how much you wash your hands \u2013 it\u2019s better than being sick.\u00a0 Wash before eating, after being around sick people or in well used public spaces.\u00a0 Carry anti-bacterial stuff with you in your purse, but wash whenever possible.\nInvest in good air filters. Replace your heat/air con filters per their instructions \u2013 at least annually \u2013 and buy good ones with a HEPA filter if possible.\u00a0 We have a separate HEPA filter in our bedroom that runs all the time.\u00a0 It has made a huge difference.\u00a0 We have this one .\u00a0 It\u2019s really expensive, but it has lasted forever.\u00a0 Most others break after a year or two.\nTake daily vitamins. I take a food-based women\u2019s multi-vitamin as well as vitamin D (because we have so little sun in Seattle).\nEat healthy, balanced meals \u2013 not too much, mostly plants, and not late at night.\u00a0 I have been a vegetarian since 1989.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to get that extreme, but eat organic, whole foods as much as possible.\u00a0 And make sure you don\u2019t eat anything 2 hours or less before bed. GERD is a huge asthma trigger.\nEliminate food sensitivities aka triggers. I knew sesame oil was a problem, but had no other food allergies that I knew of.\u00a0 And then\u2026 there was wheat.\u00a0 I had no idea!\u00a0 The change a gluten-free diet has made for me\u2026 is the biggest change yet.\u00a0 I highly recommend doing a cleanse to find out what you\u2019re allergic and sensitive to.\nDo a Cleanse or Detox. Gets all those toxins out of your system, makes you feel GREAT, eliminates the foods you\u2019re most likely to be sensitive to, and gives you a clean slate to test out foods you might be allergic to.\u00a0 You can do it with your doctor\u2019s guidance. I did it and LOVED it .\u00a0 Alternatively, do the Elimination Diet .\nKeep your chest and breath warm. I have my own fashion:\u00a0 I have a ton of scarves.\u00a0 I\u2019m always wearing them.\u00a0 The secret:\u00a0 they\u2019re to keep my chest warm!\u00a0 A pulmonologist told me this once, and it totally works.\u00a0 I don\u2019t leave home without wearing a scarf unless it\u2019s pretty warm outside.\u00a0 I also bring one out to dinner or movies, or friends\u2019 houses.\u00a0 Your lungs are so reactive when you have asthma, that they react to cold as well as actual allergens.\nNo ice. For the same reasons as #15.\u00a0 I always used to have asthma attacks in bars.\u00a0 I was complaining to my pulmonologist, and she said \u201cdo you get drinks with ice in them?\u201d So I tried not having ice, and she was right!\nStay clear of highly polluting substances. If you don\u2019t have to walk along the freeway to work, don\u2019t.\u00a0 If you can put your printer far away from your work station, do.\u00a0 If you can live in a place without floors with formaldehyde, please do (many carpets and wood floors are glued with the nastiest of chemicals!!).\u00a0 Stay clear of the smokers\u2026\nLearn to nurture yourself. Take a break when you\u2019re sick.\u00a0 Get a massage (it can loosen up chest and shoulder muscles that are keeping your chest from fully opening).\u00a0 Try acupuncture.\u00a0 Drink warm tea.\nYoga. Exercise plus de-stress plus lung opening equals asthmatic friend. I love it .\nKnow your own limits. Know when you shouldn\u2019t push it, and know when it\u2019s ok to push it. For instance, learn when you\u2019re feeling so good for a while that you might try a little less medication for a day and see what happens.\u00a0 Learn your edge.\nHave a supportive partner or family if possible. If you live with someone, tell them a little about what you\u2019re learning and what if feels like.\u00a0 They likely have NO idea that you feel like a fish out of water.\u00a0 They might be able to help cut down on the toxins in your home as well, and may be able to help recognize when you\u2019re starting to have an attack so you can catch it early.\nHire cleaners. It took a long time for me to come to terms with this one.\u00a0 But every single doctor has told me I can\u2019t be the one to clean our home, because cleaning stirs up so much dust.\u00a0 So I took the plunge and we now have green cleaners that come once a month.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget you also have to leave the house when they\u2019re cleaning!\nDetox your workplace. Printers, dirty carpets, perfumes,\u2026 there are a lot of things you can\u2019t control very well.\u00a0 I have plants all around my desk to help purify the air, as well as a little desk HEPA filter I use on occasion.\u00a0 Keep your desk clean and free of dust.\nWork to solve other health issues you have. Often asthma is not a lonely culprit \u2013 it is often aggravated by, or aggravates, other health issues.\u00a0 For me it was GERD (until I stopped eating gluten), grinding my teeth (I now have a nightguard), shoulder and chest weakness (which yoga is helping with), and gluten intolerance.\nRead and learn regularly. There are always new medications and studies being done.\u00a0 You may find that a new study has indicated asthma may be caused by something or other, or a new exercise is thought to make a difference.\u00a0 Try it.\u00a0 It may or may not work, but I\u2019ve found a few ideas that way!\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019ve learned there are breath coaches out there and I\u2019m wondering if that my be my last push to freedom from medication.\u00a0 We shall see!\nGood luck and I wish you the best of health.\u00a0 Please ask me any questions \u2013 I\u2019ll answer if I can, or try to point you in the right direction if I can\u2019t!\n"}]]}
