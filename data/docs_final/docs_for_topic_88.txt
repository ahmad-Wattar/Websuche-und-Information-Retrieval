Philosophy IS the road less traveled, and it can make all the difference. Besides, what if the hokey pokey isn\u2019t what it\u2019s all about?\nWHAT CAN I DO WITH A PHILOSOPHY DEGREE?\nANYTHING AND EVERYTHING!\nIs Philosophy practical?\nYES! And it is an ideal major for smart, motivated people who have a vision of what they want to do in life. The philosophy major provides a true education, rather than mere training. Most on campus interviewers are interested in interviewing \u201call majors.\u201d This is because most employers seek smart people who are able to think critically and respond positively to changes and problems. More so than perhaps any other major, philosophy teaches skills and abilities that are practical and applicable to any career. These never go out of style:\nThe ability to think logically.\nThe ability to analyze and solve problems.\nThe ability to assess the pros and cons of proposed solutions.\nThe ability to write and speak clearly.\nThe ability to persuade.\nThe ability to conduct thorough research.\nThe ability to ask the right questions.\nThe ability to think creatively and imaginatively.\nWhat careers do philosophy majors typically pursue?\nMost majors offer only a few career possibilities, but with a philosophy major the possibilities are endless. The list of careers and career areas typically pursued by philosophy majors includes, but is not limited to: law, medicine, education, F.B.I., government, publishing, writing, research, consulting, social and community services, business, and computer programming.\nHow do philosophy majors score on standardized tests?\nIn short, philosophy majors score among the very best.\nIf you want to go to Law School, you should know that nationally the mean score on the LSAT(Law School Admissions Test) for philosophy majors is higher than that for both political science and pre-law majors.\nIf you want to go to graduate school in any field, you should know that nationally philosophy majors go on to advanced degrees in philosophy as well as nearly every other area of study. On the GRE (Graduate Record Exam) philosophy majors have the highest mean verbal score of all majors, the second highest mean analytic score of all majors, and the highest mean quantitative score of all humanities and social science majors.\nIf you want to pursue an MBA, you should know that nationally philosophy majors have a higher mean GMAT score than business majors (accounting, finance, management, etc.).\nIf you want to pursue a career in medicine, you should know that you can major in philosophy and still go to medical school. In fact, many medical schools look very favorably on a major in the humanities as long as the requisite science courses are taken as well. Philosophy majors actually have a significantly higher medical school acceptance rate than biology or chemistry majors. No statistics concerning the scores of philosophy majors on the MCAT are available. But we can tell you that one King\u2019s philosophy major is now an M.D. and another philosophy major (who graduated from Cornell University Veterinary School) is now a Vet.\nWhat if I'm interested in philosophy but want to major in something else?\nYou should know that philosophy works very well as a double major or minor with any other area of study. The study of philosophy can provide you with highly valuable insight into the nature of literature and the humanities, psychology and the social sciences, chemistry and the natural sciences, and economics and business. You can earn a minor in philosophy by taking just four courses beyond the Core requirements.\nI've never heard of anyone majoring in philosophy.\nYes you have! Here are just a few of the philosophy majors you may certainly have heard of:\nGovernment, Politics, and Law: Thomas Jefferson (U.S. President), David Souter (Supreme Court Justice), William Bennett (Secretary of Education and best-selling author), Patrick Buchanan (presidential candidate and political columnist), Jerry Brown (former governor of California and presidential candidate), Raisa Gorbachev (former first lady of the Soviet Union), Fred Thompson (former Senator and presidential candidate).\nBusiness: J.

He studied under Plato for twenty years and raised a monument to him after his death. After Plato died in 307, Aristotle went to the court of his friend Hermeias who had studied with him at the Academy and raised himself from slavery to become dictator of Atarneus and Assus in upper Asia Minor. Hermeias' daughter Pythias became his wife. After Hermeias was assassinated by the Persians, the couple fled to Lesbos, where Aristotle studied the natural history of the island and Pythias gave birth to a daughter, then died. In 343 Philip of Macedon asked him to tutor Alexander, then thirteen; he was the future emperor's teacher for four years. By 338, Philip's armies had subjugated Greece. Aristotle directed the restoration of Stageirus which had been destroyed in the war of Olynthus, and drew up laws for the city. During his years as a naturalist, city planner, builder and lawmaker, he lived a down-to-earth life which colored his inquiries and his philosophy.\nAfter Philip's death in 336, Alexander became ruler of the Macedonian Empire and held power until he perished in an ill-starred military campaign in 323. In 335 Aristotle returned to Athens and founded a school of philosophy and rhetoric, the Lyceum. Alexander probably supplied the money, since Aristotle chose an elegant group of buildings dedicated to Apollo Lyceus, surrounded with shady gardens and covered walks. He established a zoo, a library, and a museum of natural history. The school was called the Lyceum, and his group and its philosophy were named Peripatetic (\"those who walk around\") after the peripatoi, or covered walks where Aristotle and his students strolled as they talked. (The word is from \"peri\" meaning \"around\", and \"pateoo\" meaning to tread or step, related to our word \"patio.\")\nIn sharp contrast to Plato, Aristotle emphasized careful observation and did not trust purely rational methods. While Plato believed that forms existed independent of nature, Aristotle held that essences existed but could only be discovered by studying nature. Like Socrates, he believed that if we study enough examples of a principle or phenomenon, we will finally be able to puzzle out the essence that underlies them. In this he turned Plato's approach upside down. For Plato a real thing or event could illustrate a principle that reason could grasp directly, while Aristotle countered that we discover the principle through observation of particulars. His method was to observe, classify, deduce the implications, and then use the deductions as the basis for a new round of observation. As we will see below, the term \"empirical\" was not coined until two centuries later, but it describes a central part of Aristotle's point of view. The revival of this method in the 16th Century was an important part of the rise of science after a millennium-and-a-half of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. \"The scientist,\" writes McCleod, \"studies particular structures and processes to learn how they reflect a being's inner nature, and what general purposes they serve, and how they do that.\nAnticipating the work of Harry Harlow and Robert W. White's Twentieth Century work on the motives of curiosity and exploration, Aristotle claimed that human beings have a deep, innate impulse to know and find out. He emphasized this motive as heavily as Sigmund Freud emphasized sexuality & repression and Alfred Adler emphasized power.\nHe described three associative processes: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. Things are seen as associated if they appear similar, or appear together in time or space.\nHe also proposed a law of frequency: That the more frequently an experience is repeated, the better it will be remembered. This principle resurfaced in several behavioral learning theories of the 1900s. And there is his law of \"ease\": That some events are remembered more easily than others, and some associations are formed more easily than others. His observation has been confirmed in our time by Martin Seligman's work on \"prepared\" stimuli, which showed that many people form fears of insects or heights more easily than other fears, and by John Garcia's demonstration that each species of animal differs from others in regard to which behaviors it learns easily and which others it learns only with difficulty, if at all.\nIn regard to the emotions, Aristotle anticipated Freud's principle of catharsis, noting that drama sometimes arouses emotions that have a cleansing or purgative effect. He could also, points out Richard Lazarus, \"...be called the first cognitive theorist of the emotions, and his analysis makes implicit use of the ideas of relationship, appraisal [of the situation's relevance to our goals], and action tendency\" (1991, p. 217). As he seeks to describe how a public speaker can manipulate the emotions of the audience, Aristotle notes that, \"Anger may be defined as a belief that we, or our friends, have been unfairly slighted, which causes in us both painful feelings and a desire or impulse for revenge. . . . We must discover (1) what the state of mind of angry people is, (2) who the people are with whom they usually get angry, and (3) on what grounds they get angry with them. It is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions\" (1941, p. 1380). In his Poetics, he describes how a tragedy can evoke the emotions of pity and fear (1970).\nAristotle saw all living beings as forming a \"ladder of creation\" and outlined nutritive (plants), sensitive (animals), and rational (human) levels. In Creative Evolution, French philosopher Henri Bergson was later to speak of the evolution of life forms as developing successively higher degrees of consciousness.\nFew ideas were more important to Aristotle than his emphasis on the purposes which our acts are meant to serve. In this he anticipated Adler and Tolman in the early Twentieth Century. We do not just act, said Aristotle, but act to accomplish something, to attain some end, and our behavior can seldom be understood without reference to this intention. This teleological principle was central to his views. At the same time, he suggested that the we gain less pleasure from attaining our goals than from exercising the abilities through which we achieve them (Lazarus, p. 92). `\nAmong the distinctions Aristotle made was that between the potential and the actual. Potential refers to the possibilities open to us. Actual is what we are. \"A human being is potentially a criminal or a saint,\" writes McCleod (65), \"but he is not potentially an elephant.\" We have the opportunity to change and become within the limits of our potentialities. It is only a small step from there to Jean-Paul Sartre's distinction between an attribute and an action.\nAristotle also reflected on the nature of causality --the \"why-because\" connection. He distinguished among \"material, efficient, formal, and final\" causes. The first three explain events in terms aof antecedent and concommitant conditions (variables). Aristotle's innovation was to add the fourth, or \"final\" cause, the end which an act is meant to serve.\nIn Aristotle's view, our physical nature is composed of matter, but our essence, the soul, is something which gradually comes into being through the course of our development. Unlike Plato, he was not convinced that it survived the body's death. He is said to have distinguished among the \"nutritive soul,\" common to all living beings, the \"sensitive soul,\" common to animals and humans, and the \"rational soul,\" found only in human beings. Each person and each species strives to actualize its own potential. (Shades of Kurt Goldstein's and Abraham Maslow's \"self-actualization\"!) In successive stages of evolution, which is a striving upward toward rationality, more and more potentialities become actual. \"Thus,\" writes McCleod (69), \"the inherent purpose of any person, living being, or object is to behave in accord with its own inner nature.\nAristotle might well be called the father of biology, for he collected an immense number of specimens and drew up the basic lines of biological classifications. This project led Aristotle to develop a large number of mutually exclusive categories, and each specimen one or another of these. A pitfall which is sometimes associated with this tendency to classify is probably as old as human thought itself. A person or thing is either this or that, edible or poisonous, friend or enemy. This is an extension of the dualistic thinking in which we conceive of two categories, and mentally put everything into either one or the other. Twentieth-Century General Semanticists christened this approach \"Aristotelian Logic,\" which they contrasted with \"non-Aristotelian Logic\" (or \"null-A\") in which a thing can occupy more than one category at once. The pervasiveness of being several-things-at-the-same-time in the natural world is reflected in the ancient Chinese yin-yang symbol, which has a white dot in the middle of the black side and a black dot in the middle of the white side. Mathematical set theory shows this quite clearly. If we draw two non-overlapping circles on a page (circle A and circle B), and fill them with dots, then we have mutually exclusive categories in which each dot is either an A or a B but not both. But if the circles overlap, there is an area AB which is part of both, and each of the dots in it is an AB dot. Add yet a third circle which overlaps both the others, and we have area ABC with dots which partake of the properties of all three circles. This depicts the basis of non-Aristotelian logic, which, as it happens, includes most of the events of interest to psychologists. Emotions, for example, usually come in clusters, such as pain and anger and grief and jealousy all mixed up together. A great deal of confusion, and wasted time and effort, has resulted from trying to divide things into this or that when in fact they are both --or all-- at once. Set Theory supplements Asian philosophy in providing a basis for a non-dualistic logic.,\nIn reality, Aristotle himself appears to have been much more openminded and pragmatic than the term \"Aristotelian Logic\" would suggest.\nHe was not, of course, right about everything. He claimed that to be fully worthy of honor, a person must be well-endowed wth the conventional goods or values of fortune, such as good birth, power, wealth, and a large body (too bad for midgets and many world-class gymnasts and figure-skaters), that falling rocks accelerate because they are happy to be getting home, and that snakes have no testacles because they have no legs. (Nichomachean Ethics IV, Oates 292, Palmer 79.) Nonetheless, Artistotle enriched and systematized the knowledge of his time in almost all the sciences of nature. The volume of research carried out at the well-funded Lyceum was enormous. Perhaps Aristotle's greatest contribution was in combining detailed systematic observation with careful reasoning, both inductive and deductive. He began science as we know it.\n\"In Aristotle and Plato together,\" writes Tarnas (68), there is an \"elegant balance and tension between empirical analysis and spiritual intuition.\" He points to Raphael's Renaissance painting The School of Athens, in which, \"in the center of the many Greek philosophers and scientists gathered in lively discussion, stand the elder Plato and the younger Aristotle, with Plato pointing upward to the heavens, to the invisible and transcendent, while Aristotle motions his hand outward and down to the earth, to the visible and immanent.\"\nFROM THE HELLENIC TO THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD\nHellenic Greece was an era of small city states marked by a combination of a fierce individualism and an equally fierce commitment to the local polis. Like Buddha with his \"Golden Mean,\" Aristotle held that finding a balance between extremes is an important part of wisdom. The Athenians had trouble finding that balance and it contributed to their unwillingness to make peace with Sparta and to their ultimate defeat, just as it contributed to the collective defeat of the individualistic city-states at the hands of Alexander's disciplined Macedonian army.\nBy the time Alexander the Great died in 323, Greece had entered a different era. The Hellenistic Age, when Greek ideas but not Greek power dominated the Eastern Mediterranean, is dated from Alexander's death to Rome's conquest of Greece in 146 B.C., but a few threads of Greek thought continued to develop until barbarians began to invade the Roman Empire around 235 A.D. During the Hellenistic Period, Greeks continued to fan outward from the denuded hills and exhausted soils of the Greek peninsula and islands to colonies all around the border of the Mediterranean, carrying their ideas and culture with them. \"Greece fell just as it culminated, yet spread triumphantly just as it submitted,\" writes Tarnas (74). \"As planned by Alexander, the large cosmopolitan cities of the empire--above all Alexandria, which he founded in Egypt, became vital centers of cultural learning, in whose libraries and academies the classical Greek inheritance survived and flourished.... [Even after] the Roman conquest, Greek high culture still presided over the educated classes of the greater Mediterranean world.... The Romans...more pragmatic genius lay in the realm of law, political administration, and military strategy. In philosophy, literature, science, art, and education, Greece remained the most compelling cultural force in the ancient world. As the Roman poet Horace noted, the Greeks, captive, took the victors captive.\"\nDuring the Hellenistic period, philosopy changed with the changing world. Aristotle's expansion and classification of the sciences had done much to separate science from philosophy. As a consequence, the Hellenistic schools strove \"less from the passion to comprehend the world in its mystery and magnitude, and more from the need to give human beings some stable belief system and inner peace\" in the face of an environment that was at once more chaotic, more cosmopolitan, and frequently more hostile (Tarnas 76). Alexander's belief that a universal humanity united everyone became more prominent, while at the same time, citizens' control over their political destiny was largely lost, first to Alexander's empire and then to Rome. There was little opportunity in these empires for most people to be politically active, influential, and responsible, hence little room for political philosophy. But there was an increasing awareness of individuality, especially in art and literature. Philosophy took a humanistic turn as people began to scrutinize human nature for laws to guide their actions, rather than looking to custom or the gods for an objective notion of the \"right.\" Several competing schools, each tracing its ancestry to some aspect of Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle's teachings, competed for the people's allegiance. \"Athens, too poor to maintain its state medical service, nevertheless opened private universities that made it...the 'school of Hellas,' the intellectual capital and arbiter of Greece.'\"(Durant, 503)\nTHE SKEPTICS\nThe school which which ultimately may have contributed most to the development of modern science was that of the Skeptics. In the end, Plato and Aristotle had agreed on very little except the possibility of arriving at ultimate truth. At the Lyceum under Aristotle's student Theophrastus, the Peripatetics turned more and more to specialized studies in botany, zoology, history, and biography. But Athens was growing poor, and not long after Theophrastus died, the center of scientific inquiry shifted to the thriving new Egyptian city founded by Alexander which he had named, of course, Alexandria. Meanwhile, at Plato's Academy, as interest turned to mathematics and morals, metaphysics languished.\nAround 360 B.C., Phyrro of Elis (c. 360-270 B.C.) was born. He studied in India and then returned to Elis, his birthplace, to teach philosophy. Phyrro was the first of the Skeptics, after the Greek term skeptikos, which meant \"inquirers.\" The Skeptics were the most direct successors to Socrates' stance of questioning every presumed certainty. Skepticism promoted a suspension of all belief. A philosophical skeptic examines alleged achievements in various fields to see if those who claim to know something really know what they claim to know. Some skeptics claimed that no knowledge beyond immediate experience is possible, while others doubted that even immediate experience is a fully reliable guide to truth.\nPhyrro took the latter tack. He maintained that we cannot find truth through the senses because they distort the object as we perceive it. Nor can we find it through reason, because we use our reason to deceive ourselves in the service of our desires. (He was unerringly accurate on that point. I have listened to people well-trained in critical thinking bend every rule of logic in order to reach conclusions which fit their emotional biases.) Therefore, held Phyrro, we cannot be certain about anything, and therefore the wise person will pursue peace of mind rather than truth. Thus Phyrro managed the neat trick of setting himself against the almost opposite teachings of Aristotle and Plato at the same time, and of simultaneously honoring and contradicting the heritage of Socrates.\nPhyrro pointed out that the same experience can be pleasant or unpleasant depending on our mood and state of mind, and that the same event can seem ugly or beautiful, or moral or immoral, depending on our point of view. Even an object can seem large or small, depending on the context. (Here he and the Sophists are on common ground.) India has one set of Gods and Greece another, and who can say which are real, if either? He went on to state that \"every reason has a corresponding reason opposed to it\" but saw little ground to prefer one reason over another. He took on conventional logic: \"Every syllogism begs the question, for its major premise assumes its conclusion.\" During the third and second centuries B.C., skepticism became the dominant position at the Academy. One of its members, Arcesilaus, declared, \"Nothing is certain, not even that.\" (Tarnas, 77)\nSince in Phyrro's view all theories are false, he found no rational grounds to prefer one course of action over another. Thus we may as easily accept the conventions and myths of one's own time and place as those of any other, so the best attitude is a calm acceptance of events and the world. He could have copied the line from Protagoras. There is, a double-standard here which is obvious once we notice it: Skepticism toward philosophic and scientific inquiry, but pragmatic acceptance of conventions. As we will see, in regard to social convention, the Cynics were the real skeptics.\nSkepticism was less influential by the second century A.D., but that century boasted the most charming and insolent writer of the skeptics, Lucian, who lectured in Rome, Gaul, and Athens, and supported himself in old age with an official post in Egypt, thanks to the generosity of Marcus Aurelius. Lucian defines philosophy as an attempt to, in the words of Durant, \"get an elevation from which you may see in every direction. [He] is as impartial as nature; he satirizes the rich for their greed, the poor for their envy, the philosophers for their cobwebs.... In the end he concludes with Voltaire that one must cultivate his garden\" (497).\nThe most mature and sensible development of the skeptical position occurred in Roman Greece during the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., under physician and philosopher Sextus Empiricus. In his Phyrronian Hypotheses and Against Mathematics, Sextus held that we should suspend judgment about all claims to knowledge that go beyond immediate experience. He pointed out that different animals perceive things differently; different people perceive things differently; human senses perceive objects in different ways; and our circumstances seem to alter what we perceive. How can we know, he asked, that we and not some other person or animal, perceive the world correctly? Have we any way of knowing under what circumstances we can tell the true nature of things?\nSextus attacked every claim by dogmatic philosophers to knowledge about the \"nonevident world\" (any condition that is not now being, and cannot at some time be, observed). Any criterion used to judge something nonevident can be tested by asking whether the criterion is itself observable. There are, he pointed out, continuing disputes about everything that cannot be observed.) He kept his position consistent by not denying that knowledge of the nonevident was possible, but saying that he suspended judgment on the question. He would surely have found B.F. Skinner a most congenial colleague. Our modern word \"empirical\" is apparently due to his influence.\nTHE CYNICS: ANTISTHENES AND DIOGENES\nWhile Plato was Socrates' most famous student, two others were also influential, Antisthenes (c. 444-371 B.C.); and Aristippus (c. 435-356 B.C.), whom we will meet later. Antisthenes, the son of an Athenian citizen and a Thracian slave, founded the school which came to be known as the Cynics. He gave up all property and dressed in a cloak so ragged that Socrates joked, \"I can see your vanity, Antisthenes, through the holes of your cloak.\" After Socrates died, Antisthenes chose to speak at the Cynosarges (Dogfish) gymnasium lecture center, because it was used by people of the lower classes and foreigners. From it comes the name \"Cynic.\" Antisthenes was a true proletarian in his disposition. He accepted no pay, dressed like a workingman, preferred the poor for pupils, and made poverty and hardship part of his course of study. \"All refined philosophy he held to be worthless; what could be known, could be known by the plain man. He believed in the 'return to nature'.... There was to be no government, no private property, no marriage, no established religion. His followers, if not he himself, condemned slavery.... He despised luxury and all pursuit of artificial pleasures of the senses.\"(Russell, 230-31) The Cynics were cynical toward all the material gettings, doings, and trivial pursuits of society. \"The essence of the Cynic philosophy,\" writes Durant, [is] to reduce the things of the flesh to bare necessities so that the soul may be as free as possible (506).\"\nAntisthenes' reputation was eclipsed by that of his student Diogenes (c. 412-323 B.C.). Almost all of us have seen the picture of an old man in a cloak, holding a lantern and a staff, which appears on many versions of the Tarot Card, \"The Hermit.\" Some say that the lantern was meant to help Diogenes in his search for truth; others hold that it was to help him find an honest man. Perhaps both assertions were true. A bankrupt banker from Sinope, Diogenes lived the Cynic doctrine totally. The St. Francis of ancient Greece, he chose the robe, wallet and staff of a beggar. He sought to render worthless the conventional labels and \"social currencies\" of the world such as \"king, general, and honor.\" He imitated the simple life of animals, sleeping on the ground, eating whatever he could find or beg, and (witnesses attest) \"performing the duties of nature and the rites of love in the sight of all. Seeing a child drink from its hands, he threw away his cup.\"(Durant, 507) He was an advocate of free love and a community of wives (but, so far as we know, not of husbands. There may be some sexism here). He refused to obey any law that made no sense to him, but injured no one. In short, he lived much like any of thousands of wandering yellow-robed mendicant sadhus in India today, but his intelligence and wisdom made him, after Alexander, the most famous man in Greece. He called Freedom of Speech the greatest of social goods, had a wonderful sense of humor, and allegedly never lost an argument.\nCynic philosophy dismissed Plato's theory of pure ideas as utter nonsense. It held that only ethics is real philosophy, and we should study the wisdom of nature as a guide to life. Happiness, it maintains, is to be found in a simple and natural life, with as little help from outside things and possessions as possible. The pursuit of pleasure so often leads to naught or to remorse that it is more often the path to unhappiness than to happiness. (Again we hear the echo of Hindu and Buddhist philosophies: To transcend desire, they hold, is a key to happiness.) \"A modest and virtuous life is the only road to abiding content, wealth destroys peace, and envious desire...eats away the soul.... Only internal freedom counts. The gods, said Diogenes, gave man an easy existence, but man complicates it by itching for luxuries.\"(Durant, 508) The Cynics held that to act in a virtuous, honorable, and upright way is its own reward. Virtue includes desiring, possessing, and eating little, drinking nothing but water, and injuring no one.\nDiogenes had many followers who begged for alms and slept on the streets or temple steps. The Cynics largely disappeared about 200 B.C., but important threads of their ideas became part of the Stoic school.\nTHE CYRENAICS AND THE EPICUREANS\nSocrates' student Aristippus (c. 435-356 B.C.) was a product of the wealth and luxury of the upper classes of the half-Asian city of Cyrene on the African coast. Handsome, refined, honest, straightforward, and articulate, he took great delight in scandalizing the respectable sinners of Athens. He declared that whatever we do is in pursuit of pleasure or from fear of pain. Pleasure is the greatest good, and everything else must be judged by how well it can bring us pleasure. Wisdom lies not in the search for abstract truth, but the quest for pleasant sensations. The keenest pleasures are physical or sensual rather than intellectual or moral, so the wise person will seek physical delights above all else. Since only the present exists, \"the art of life lies in plucking pleasures as they pass, and making the most of what the moment gives.\"(Durant, p. 504)\nThis came to be called the \"Cyrenaic\" school, and it is the most explicitly hedonistic philosophy found in the Greek tradition. All opinion was dismissed as illusory; only physical sensations were viewed as sure guides to action. (Here Aristippus and Sextus Empiricus are not so far apart.) Philosopy's greatest value is helping us find and use what is pleasant. The goal is not to master pleasures by asceticism, but to enjoy them without becoming enslaved by them, and to learn to tell the difference between those that endanger us and those that don't. Thus wisdom includes a circumspect respect for law and public opinion, and in being \"neither the master nor the slave of any man.\" Wealth and luxury were viewed as capable of producing pleasure, but not as pleasant in and of themselves. It might be better to be poor and free than wealthy and choked with cares. Aristippus declared that his greatest gift to his daughter Arete was that he had taught her \"to set a value on nothing that she can do without.\" She followed him as head of the Cyrenaic school and became known as \"The Light of Hellas.\"\nFourteen years after Aristippus died, Epicurus (c.342-270 B.C.) was born on the small, sun-drenched, hilly island of Samos, cooled by breezes and surrounded by the deep blue sea. He studied at the Academy in Athens, and borrowed from many philosophers who had preceded him. He credited much of his thought to Democritus and to Aristippus, whose philosophy of pleasure was actually more \"Epicurean\" in the Roman sense than Epicurus' ever was. He lectured on philosophy in various Asian cities. The citizens of Lampascus thought so well of him that they bought him a house and gardens on the outskirts of Athens for his school. He welcomed women into his community, and gave equal treatment to rich and poor, slaves and freemen.\nFar from adopting an opulent lifestyle, Epicurus lived simply and quietly. His motto was \"live unobtrusively.\" He is said to have been an unsurpassably kind and generous man. His basic premise is that the goal of philosophy is to free people from fear (especially fear of the gods). He disliked religion because he thought it thrived on ignorance and darkened life with fear of punishment. The Gods, he suggested, live a serene and deathless life in some far-off space among the stars but do not bother with the affairs of so insignificant a species as humankind. He followed the atomism of Democritus but rejected the latter's determinism. \"According to Epicurus, the atoms making up humans never lose their ability to move freely; hence, he postulated free will. Epicurus agreed with Democritus that there was no afterlife because the soul was made up of freely moving atoms that scattered upon death... [so] the atoms comprising an individual would become part of another configuration following the individual's death.... The good life must be attained in this world, for there is no other.... Epicurus believed that the idea of immortality destroyed the only hope most people had for finally escaping pain\" (Hergenhahn, 57). \"Death, therefore, is nothing to us, nor does it concern us in the least, inasmuch as the mind is held to be mortal,\" wrote the later Epicurean Lucretius.(MaGill 222)\nEpicurus had an interesting theory of knowledge. Repeated experiences preserved in memory give rise to \"anticipations\" which make language possible. When I hear the word \"tree\" I \"anticipate\" the kind of knowledge to which the name refers. He had no use for rhetoric, which he called \"an abuse of language.\"\nEpicurus stressed \"practical wisdom\", which compares pleasures to pains, accepting pains that lead to greater pleasures and rejecting pleasures that lead to greater pains. The justification for virtues like justice, temperance, and courage is that they are among the means for living the pleasant life. Judgments about good and right, he held, have meaning so far as they refer to pleasures and pains. \"We recognize pleasure as the first good in us, and from pleasure we begin every act of choice and avoidance.\"\nHe distinguished between \"kinetic\" pleasures like eating which result from some action, and \"catastematic\" pleasures like not being hungry which result from a stable condition. He most often spoke of \"pleasure\" in the sense of avoiding unpleasantness. The good life, he said, depends most on the latter. Pleasures of the mind are related closely to physical sensations. The mind feels delight at the body's well being, and enjoys peace of mind at the removal of pains and cares. A wise person remembers past pleasures and looks forward to pleasures to come when faced with distress in the presence. (There seems more than a little similarity between these ideas and Thorndike's \"satisfiers\" and \"annoyers.\")\nWe have three kinds of needs that will not be denied, he held: Equanimity or peace of mind; bodily health and comfort; and the exigencies of life itself. Luckily few things are really necessary to sustain life and keep the body healthy, and in most cases they are fairly easy to obtain.\nThere are, he declared, two kinds of desire: Natural Desire and Vain Desire. Natural desire includes those that are necessary, such as for food and sleep, and those that are not, such as for sex. Vain Desire is the wish for things like decorative clothing, a fancy chariot, or exotic food. Necessary natural desiress must be satisfied and they bring pleasure and not much pain. But Epicurus held that unecessary natural desires, like sex, involves relationships that ultimately are more painful than pleasant, and so should be overcome when possible. (Perhaps emotional wounds from his own life have found their way into his philosophy.) Vain desires, because there are no natural limits to them, tend to become obsessive and bring painful consequences if we give ourelves over to trying to fulfill them.(Palmer, 82-3)\nEpicurus' definition of pleasure is largely negative --the absence of pain. Palmer (84-5) maintains that \"the trouble with this definition is that, taken to its logical extremity, the absence of life is better than any life at all (as Freud discovered in his Beyond the Pleasure Principle where he claimed that behind the 'pleasure principle' is THANATOS, the Death Instinct.)\" Epicurus, who was sickly in his later years, did indeed pay great attention to the desire for repose. both physical and mental, and to being free from worry. One of his favorite pleasures was to repose in his hammock, swinging back and forth.\nPrudence, said Epicurus, means knowing what various satisfactions are worth and what they cost. It is prudent, he said, to get used to simple food and plain surroundings. If we learn to be satisfied with these, we are freed from most of the cares of the future. He agreed with Democritus that justice begins in \"a pledge of mutual advantage to restrain men from harming one another and save them from being harmed.\" As circumstances change, what was once considered just may be so no longer. The justice of a law ultimately depends on it being of advantage to all parties to the compact. Since we can never be sure we will not be caught if we act unjustly, he said, \"The just man is most free from trouble, the unjust most full of trouble.\" He urged us to avoid fame and power because these make other envious and they may become enemies. Better, he counseled, to try to live our lives unnoticed.\nThe teachings of Epicurus were popularized during the first century B.C. by Lucretius (Titus Lucretius Carus, c. 98-55 B.C.), whose On the Nature of Things is generally agreed to be the greatest didactic poem in any language. This work contrasts \"the peaceful serenity of the Epicurean's life...with the troubled existence of the unenlightened, who in getting and spending lay waste their powers\" (MacGill 220). Lucretius emphasized the Epicurean preference for naturalistic explanations:: \"You will learn thus, led on with little trouble; for one thing will grow clear from another, nor will blind night snatch away the road and not let you perceive Nature's ultimates. Thus things will kindle lights for things.... Nothing prevents us living a life worthy of the gods.\" This great unfinished work of philosophical poetry ends abruptly at its author's death, from causes unkown to us.\nIn sum, Epicurus is one of history's most misunderstood philosophers. In his inclinations and habits he was more stoic than \"Epicurean,\" and the philosophers whose views were most like those often attributed to him were the Cyrenaics Aristippus and Arete.\nWhy the misunderstanding? \"Some of Epicurus' Roman followers interpreted 'pleasure' ...as positive titillation,\" writes Palmer (85). Due to their misinterpretation, epicureanism today is often equated with sensualistic or greedy hedonism.\nTHE STOICS, FROM ZENO OF CITIUM TO MARCUS AURELIUS\nThe Stoic school existed as such for five hundred years. It held that the basic task of humankind is to follow the law of nature, and devoted itself to determining what that is.\nThe Stoic lineage can easily be traced back to the cosmopolitan Cynics, with their view of nature as superior to local customs or politics, their Spartan lifestyle, and their belief in the autarkeia, or autonomy, of the virtuous person. Indeed, Stoic teachings are foreshadowed in Heraclitus of Ephesus, with his subordination of the person to the law of nature, to logos or reason, and his belief in eternal change. The Stoics also revered Socrates for his enduring example of rational self-control and the simplicity of his material life.\nThe school itself is said to have begun in 300 B.C. when its founder Zeno of Citium (also sometimes called Zeno of Cyprus, c. 336-262 B.C.), who was born in Citium, Cyprus began lecturing on the Painted Porch (Stoa Poikile) of a temple in Athens named for the paintings of Polygnotus which adorned it. Other early Stoics were the poet and religious visionary Cleanthes (c. 331-232 B.C.) and the systematizer Chrysippus (c. 280-206). From the work of these three emerged the basic Stoic philosophy. Zeno of Citium believed that the world was ruled by a divine plan, that whatever happens occurs for a reason, that to live in accord with nature was the ultimate virtue, and that learning to accept one's fate with indifference, even if suffering was involved, was part of the task that faces us. Like the Epicureans, the Stoics sought to give human beings a stable basis for ethics and inner peace in the face of a chaotic and sometimes hostile environment. Like the Cynics, the Stoics viewed all human beings as participants in the divine Logos, as members of a universal human brotherhood and sisternood. Unlike other philosophies of the time, in the Stoic view each person \"was called upon to participate actively in the affairs of the world and thereby fulfill his duty to this great community.... Stoicism, the most broadly representative of the Hellenistic philosophies,\" writes Tarnas, possessed a loftiness of vision and moral temper that would long leave its mark on the Western spirit\" (76).\nThe good life according to the Stoics includes cultivating intelligence, bravery, justice, and self control. Study and imitation of the wise person was said to be one path to wisdom. We can learn to become indifferent to the vicissitudes of fate, yet must hold ourselves and others ethically responsible for every action. We likewise have a responsibility to play the part in civic life that we are suited by our nature to play, but must not attach our happiness to place, power, or possessions.\nThis is no self-indulgent philosophy.\nAll the chief virtues are related, the Stoics maintained, so that we cannot succeed in developing some while neglecting the others. This conception is related to the ideal of a balance among the different sides of a person's being and life which played a major role in many strains of Hellenic and Hellenistic thought.\nThe Stoics also believed that every person, even slaves and foreigners, held within them a spark of the creative fire. It is a person's duty, they said, to do more than seek personal happiness. We must, like all other beings in nature who do their useful work as part of the larger systems of which they are part, be of service to our fellow humans beings and to other creatures. Zeno longed for a breakdown of racial and national barriers. He and Chrysippus looked forward to a time of no nations, no classes, no rich or poor, no masters or slaves, when all human beings would be brothers and sisters togethers as members of one great family.\nIn the second and first centuries B.C., the Middle Stoics strongly influenced the increasingly powerful Roman Republic. These included Diogenes of Seleucia, Panaetius of Rhodes, and Posidonius of Apamea. These three had a strong influence on the brightest of the Roman intellectuals, and through them on the broader Roman culture. \"Panaetius,\" writes Philip P. Hallie, \"faces forward to the time when Stoicism became involved in the military, social, and political life of Rome. He helped soften the asceticism of the Early Stoa, attached more value to external goods than the Early Stoa did, and spoke in terms of gradual moral progress or discipleship, not the pure ideal of the wise man. Posidonius, on the other hand, brought rigor and detail to the Stoic system.\"(p. 20) Things that early Stoics said the wise person would spurn came to be spoken of as \"advantages\" to be used but not to be needed. This broadened Stoicism's appeal.\nIt is an irony of history that Rome was a stoic civilization during its early years, and that its great Stoic philosophers appeared on the scene during its decadent later years. During the first several hundred years of Roman power, its people dressed simply, diluted their wine with water, and in public life men of the upper classes were expected to be stern, calm, and austere. Luxury in dress and dining were frowned upon and even in their private lives people were expected to live in a Spartan manner. These qualities built the Empire. \"The typical educated Roman of this age,\" writes Durant in Caesar and Christ, \"was orderly, conservative, loyal, sober, reverent, tenacious, severe, practical. He enjoyed discipline, and would have no nonsense about liberty. He obeyed as a training for command. He took it for granted that the government had a right...to value him purely according to his services to the state.... He could not, for the life of him, understand Plato, or Archimedes, or Christ. He could only rule the world.\"\nSeneca (c. 4 B.C..-65 A.D.), born in Cordoba, Spain, is the most paradoxical figure among the stoics. Born to a wealthy family, he became extremely rich through clever investments. The millionaire sage marvelled when his one of his friends, a teacher of Cynic philosophy who lived by begging, refused a gift of 200,000 sesterces from the emperor Caligula. When asked about the friendship, Seneca said, \"Why should I not hold Demetrius in high esteem? I have found that he lacks nothing.\"\nSeneca was a man of action and worldly affairs as well as a philosopher. He sought in stoicism a guide to \"human decency, family unity, and social order.\" Like most people of wealth, he was no radical. Despite his riches, he found stoicism a guide in his personal habits -- he ate sparingly, drank only water, and slept on a hard mattress. After a lengthy exile to Corsica for alleged improper relations with Julia, daughter of Germanicus, he was recalled to Rome to tutor the young emperor-to-be Nero. \"In truth he never made up his mind which he loved better,\" writes Durant,- \"philosophy or power, wisdom or pleasure; and he was never convinced of their incompatibility. He admitted that he was a very imperfect sage. 'I persist in praising not the life that I lead, but that which I ought to lead.'\" Yet after Rome burned in 64, he donated the greater part of his wealth to rebuilding the city. Soon afterward he wrote four books of informal essays which were \"urbane attempts to adapt Stoicism to the needs of a millionaire.\" Durant sums up his views: \"He is too Stoic to be practical, and too lenient to be Stoic..... Wisdom is the art of living. Happiness is the goal, but virtue, not pleasure, is the road....In the long run honesty, justice, forbearance, kindliness, bring us more happiness than ever comes from the pursuit of pleasure.... How does one acquire wisdom? By practicing it daily, in however modest a degree; by examining your conduct each day at its close; by [working to reduce] your own faults and [being] lenient to those of others; by associating with those who excel you in wisdom and virtue; by taking some acknowledged sage as your invisible counselor.\"(306) Accident and illness aside, he held, we all hold in our hands the final choice of when and how we die.\nEpictetus was a Greek born at Hierapolis in Phrygia about 50 A.D.. Since he was a slave woman's son, he too became a slave. Eventually he became the property of Epaphroditus, Nero's administrative secretary. He was lame, apparently due to beatings by one of his owners. Epaphroditus sent him to the lectures of stoic teacher C. Musonius Rufus and later freed him. He became a teacher of stoic philosophy in Rome until about 90 A.D., when Domitian banished all philosophers and he left for Nicopolis in Epirus to continue his teachings.\nEpictetus held that we must find happiness within ourselves, stressing the importance of cultivating complete independence from external circumstances. He cited the example of Diogenes, who wore sackcloth and slept on the bare ground, and quoted Diogenes' remark that Fame is but the empty noise of madmen. When a feast is set before us, he said, we accept what is given, rather than asking for something more. In this way we learn to endure all the twists and turns of fate. \"Have you not received the inner powers with which to endure all that comes to pass?\" he asked. \"Do you not have greatness of heart, courage, fortitude?\" Even a slave as he himself was, he pointed out, can be inwardly and spiritually free. Events are what they are, but what we make of them is up to us.\"\nEpictetus foreshadowed contemporary communication theorists' \"reframing\" and cognitive behaviorists' \"cognitive restructuring\" in his observation, \"Everything has two handles, one by which it may be borne, the other by which it may not. If your brother sin against you lay not hold of it by the handle of his injustice, for by that it may not be borne; but rather by the fact that he is your brother, the comrade of your youth, and by this handle it may be borne.\"\nHe anticipated the emphasis which Gestalt Therapy places on direct awareness in his question, \"Are we in our senses, or are we not?\" He was even something of a behaviorist. \"Habits and faculties are necessarily affected by the corresponding acts. Those that were not there before, spring up; the rest gain in strength and extent.... Suppose you have once lusted after money.... the next time [this lust] is excited by the corresponding object, the flame of desire leaps up more quickly than before. By frequent repetition, the mind in the long run becomes callous and...produces confirmed Avarice.\"\nThere was a bit of behavioral self-monitoring in his suggested method for overcoming anger. \"If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit.... Keep quiet and count the days when you were not angry: \"I used to be angry every day, then every other day: next every two, next every three days!\"\nHe agreed with Socrates that it is important to throw away conceit about what we think we know, or we will learn nothing. He insisted on rigorous, continuing ethical instruction and effort. This included daily self-examination, in order to learn to evaluate one's actions clearly. Each person alone is responsible for his or her own deeds. We each have the power to choose, assent, or refuse. We possess the power to mold our own personalities. But such transformations may take time: \"All great things are slow of growth; even a grape or a fig. If you say, \"I want a fig,\" I will reply, \"It needs time: First to flower, then to drop its blossoms, then to grow and ripen.\"\nHe pointed out that Socrates never became heated in argument and never insulted others, but rather patiently questioned them and often bore insult from them, accepting this end to a quarrel when no other seemed possible. He added that a guide does not mock the ignorant, but shows them the right way.\nHere are just a few memorable lines:\n\"What you do not wish to endure yourself, do not attempt to impose on others.\"\n\"In this great Fair of life, some, like the cattle, trouble themselves about nothing but the fodder.\"\n\"A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a single hope.\"\n\"Try to enjoy the great festival of life with other men.\"\nA largely-forgotten Stoic philosopher named Diognetus was one of the principal teachers of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who was born in Rome in 121 A.D., became emperor in 161 and ruled the until his death in 180. The Emperor found his central inspiration in the writings of Epictetus, which were brought to his attention by another philosopher, Junius Rusticus. His Meditations, written in Greek, are the last major contribution to Stoic philosophy.\nThe emperor who preceded him, Antoninus Pius, is widely recognized as the ablest and wisest man who ruled Rome before Marcus. In every area he was an outstanding administrator. He respected the rights and freedoms of his subjects and was greatly concerned with their welfare. Only Antoninus' adopted son Marcus outshone him. In one matter Antoninus did much better than Marcus: He chose Marcus as his adopted son and future emperor, while Marcus allowed the throne to pass to his own son Commodus, who had a cruel streak and proved unfit to be emperor. (Gossip was widespread that Commodus was actually the offspring of a liason between Marcus' wife and a gladiator while Marcus was off at the wars or busy with affairs of state.)\nNonetheless, Marcus Aurelius himself ranks among the few true \"philosopher-kings\" of history. He governed with remarkable skill, was a brilliant military strategist, and left a written record of his philosophy. During his reign the far-flung empire was frequently challenged by barbarian armies, and it was during his spare time on military campaigns that he wrote much what became his \"Meditations.\" Among the passages he penned are these:\n\"Value nothing as profitable which compels you to break your promise, to lose your self-respect, to hate any person, to act the hypocrite, or to desire anything which needs walls and curtains.\" Among the virtues he praised were simplicity, modesty, gentleness, bravery, truth, fidelity, and contentment.\nHe gave equal weight to inward self-control and to contributing in a useful way to his community and society (Halle, p. 20). He had no intent to create a utopia. \"Let it be sufficient,\" he wrote, \"that you have in some degree ameliorated mankind, and do not think such improvement a matter of small importance.\" He \"devised legal protection for wards against dishonest guardians, for debtors against creditors, for provinces against governors...required the use of foiled weapons in gladiatorial contests, and did all that...custom would allow to banish death from the arena.\"(Durant, 1944, 428). The people protested with good humor, \"He wants to force us to be philosophers.\"\nHe presaged Gestalt psychology, systems theory, and ecology in his comment, \"Thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of this whole, and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole.\"(201) He had a keen appreciation of history and possibility but stressed action in the present moment: \"Bear in mind that every man lives only this present time, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past or it is uncertain.\"(209)\nMarcus Aurelius described the stoic ideal of an introspective psychology. \"It is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere, either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble, does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquillity; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental.\"(212)\nHe counseled, \"Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, 'I have been harmed.' Take away the complaint, \"I have been harmed,\" and the harm is taken away.... Do not have such an opinion of things as he has who does thee wrong, or such as he wishes thee to have, but look at them as they are in truth.\"(213-14) He was content to have us do the best we can: \"Be not...discouraged...if thou dost not succeed in doing everything according to right principles; but...be content if the greater part of what thou doest is consistent with man's nature.\"(225)\nHe also counseled, \"Do what is necessary, and discern what is not. Since the greatest part of what we say and do is unnecessary, if you take this away you will have more leisure and less uneasiness. On every occasion you can ask yourself, 'Is this necessary?' This applies to thoughts as well as acts.\" He considered wisdom itself the most agreeable of all pleasures.\nThe excerpts above are just a few from the Golden Sayings and the Meditations. I have read both again and again, and found more in them of value to me personally than in any other work of Greek philosophy.\nA careful reading shows that, taken together, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius provided a solid foundation for cognitive-behavioral psychology. Much of the work of such figures as Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, A. John Rush, and others might easily be viewed as built on the foundation of these ancients--or perhaps it was a matter of the same principles being independently realized, two thousand years apart.\nAfter Commodus and a succession of other incompetent emperors, Christianity replaced philosophy, the Empire crumbled, and for a thousand years Greek thought was largely forgotten. Not until the thinkers of the Renaissance began to read the ancient texts did the old Greek philosophers, who in some ways seem so remarkably contemporary, begin to affect the Western World again.\nWHAT DID THEY HAVE IN COMMON?\nThe sweep of history which embraces the philosophers and schools we have just surveyed spans seven hundred years. We have looked at their differences and now we can briefly examine their similarities. The orgins of their philosophy lie, argues humanistic psychologist Mike Arons, \"in an experience...of dissatisfaction, incompleteness, insufficiency\" (1994, p. 17). This may be with the state of our knowledge about our world and the universe, or about how to live a satisfying life.\nFrom this beginning, the Greeks sought to fathom the nature of reality, they tried to fathom what it was to live life well, they formulated codes of ethics, and, argues Arons, they strove toward self-sufficiency (autarkeia), the same word Abraham Maslow used to describe the \"self-actualizing\" people he studied. Aristotle held that we aim toward a state of being in which \"nothing lacks.\" While his approach of enumerating the things a person needed for such self-sufficiency differed from that of the Cynics and Stoics who emphasized letting go of attachments to things we can get along without, almost all aim at describing a path by which we can attain happiness (Eudaimaia). In this, writes Arons, \"common sense and reason work in tandem and never definitively part, for they are centered on a common value.... What reason supported and supporting intuition told the ancients --in looking at their lives as a whole -- is that we do anything or everything: health, wealth, good relations, recognition, etc. for happiness. We do not do happiness for anything or everything else. Happiness is an end in itself, ...an intrinsic value\" (p. 20). The interesting questions involve how we get there. Our challenges lie, as Sartre pointed out, in the choices which involve choosing well, or poorly, for our lives. I am reminded of the moment in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in which the skinny old Crusader, clanking about in his armor from a thousand years before, motioned around the cave filled with goblets of every shape and kind. Drinking from one would bring instant annihilation; from another, magical healing healing or eternal life. Jones and the German woman each chose a chalice; after the consequences were known, the old crusader, in a masterpiece of simultaneous understatement and redundancy, turned to one and said, \"You chose. . . badly.\" To the other, he said, \"You chose. . . well.\"\nMany modern approaches to ethics, points out Arons, \"deal with specific problems as they come up.... The Ancients (as he calls the old Greek thinkers), by contrast, start the inquiry by looking at the Picture of one's life as a whole. ...The ancient's perspective, like that of humanistic-transpersonal psychologists, is a holistic one, not an atomistic or pragmatic means to specific problem-solving\" (21).\nArons goes on to point out that issues of ethics --concern about acting in ways that help rather than harm others-- played a central role in Greek thought. \"For all the schools, ethics is not something which must be accounted for in achieving personal happiness, it is an intrinsic part of that pursuit\" (23). To me this means seeking my gain in ways which bring others misery cuts me off from parts of myself which would contribute to my own happiness. Abraham Maslow points out that at some level, the Nazi concentration camp guard must \"feel his psychological bones being crushed.\" The Stoics saw the unfolding of an ethical point of view as a natural part of the development of human nature.\nThe psychology and ethics of the Greeks, argues Arons, is summed up in such twentieth-century conceptions as Maslow's \"self-actualization\" and Carl Rogers' \"fully functioning person.\" Fritz Perls adds the insight that we grasp the the Gestalt of our life as a whole through direct awareness in the immediate moment. The ancients agree with humanistic psychologists on the importance of \"an intrinsically oriented path... One does \"it\" for itself.... This, I suspect, is why 'self-actualization,' to the degree that it speaks to the sense of completeness.. is more appropriate than 'happiness' for our times\" (29). They agree with transpersonal psychologists on the importance of finding methods and occasions to transcend our \"me-first\" attitudes and antagonistic states of consciousness. Some, like the Cynics, even agree with eco-psychologists on the importance of living in a close and mutually supportive relationship with nature.\nPHILOSOPHY, THE GODS, AND THE MYSTERIES\nWith all its brilliance, Greek philosophy had its limits as a psychology. This was partly because except for Aristotle, the ancient thinkers systematically exalted reason and paid too little attention to the role of passion and action in human life. Contrast their outlook, for example, with that of Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba, whom perhaps only the Cynics and Cyrenaics would have welcomed as one of their own.\nNor did Greek philosophy have much use for the feminine half of the human race. Epicurus welcomed women among his followers, and there was Arete, the Light of Hellas, who inherited her mantle from her father Aristippus, but they were the exception. Greek philosophy was largely a masculine endeavor which tells us little of the feminine psyche or worldview. Greek society, the Hellenistic world, and Rome were patriarchal, male-dominated societies. Most of the discourses of women took place not in the academies and lecture-halls, but in the temples of the Gods and the sanctuaries of the mysteries. But that story goes beyond the boundaries of this paper, and is a tale for another time and place.\n______________________\nREFERENCES\nAristotle, (1970) Poetics, tr. by H. Preston Epps.

Just what is rightness <em>in</em> an individual choice, <em>or</em> justice <em>in</em> a social institution?", "explanation": null, "document": "Jim Pryor's Guidelines to Writing Philosophy Papers\nThe Study of Philosophy\nPhilosophy is concerned with large, difficult, and controversial questions, many of which have been the subject of inquiry and debate since ancient times. Some pertain to what is. (What makes me what I am? How is my mind related to my body? Do all events, including the choices I make, have causes?) Others pertain to what ought to be. (If the choices I make have causes outside me, can they be judged right or wrong? Just what is rightness in an individual choice, or justice in a social institution? What is the relationship between rightness or justice and having good consequences?) Yet others pertain to what is knowable. (How can unperceived causes be legitimately inferred from perceived events? Does all knowledge require inference from perceptual experience? Are there truths that cannot be known at all?)\nDifferent branches of philosophy are distinguished by the kinds of questions they treat: Metaphysics is concerned with what is, ethics and philosophy of value with what ought to be, logic and philosophy of science with what is knowable. Since important contributions have been made since the earliest times, the history of philosophy constitutes a fourth branch of the subject alongside the three just named. What unites the different branches of philosophy is a common commitment to disciplined thinking, even or especially when treating questions whose every aspect is doubtful and disputed. Questions are addressed by appeal to reasoned argument and the evidence of experience, without asking that anyone take anything on authority or on faith.\nPrinceton's philosophy department has consistently been ranked one of the top few in the country, and counts many scholars of international reputation among its faculty. It offers a diverse selection of courses from different branches of philosophy each semester, teaching historical material from original works in translation, and other material mainly from recent and contemporary scholarly publications. Thus it is possible for the student to acquire both a thorough grounding in the classics and an introduction to on-going research at the forefront of the subject. For concentrators, the regular option combines an expectation of substantial work on a diverse range of questions (at least two courses in each of at least three of the four branches of philosophy) with considerable freedom to pursue individual interests in independent work with faculty advisors; special options in interdisciplinary areas, such as political philosophy and philosophy of science, add flexibility by permitting the substitution of work in a relevant outside field for one area of philosophy.\nReturn to the top of the page\nPhilosophy and Your Future\nSince the opening of the first schools of philosophy in antiquity, many students of the subject have put their training in the analysis of argument and evaluation of evidence to work in a subsequent legal career; law schools have long recognized the value of an undergraduate major in philosophy. Increasingly other professional schools and employers have come to recognize it as well, and many of our recent concentrators have gone on successfully to work in medicine, journalism, business, or government. A few concentrators go on to graduate study in philosophy; those who do so generally achieve admission to top-ranked schools, with good fellowships.\nSkills acquired by concentrating in philosophy can thus be useful for a variety of careers. But the main benefit lies in learning to think in an organized way about confusing and controversial questions; to treat one's beliefs as serviceable as they are but capable of improvement; to react to criticism not with outrage or fear but with a willingness to state the grounds for one's views and to listen to and learn from the views of others. These are habits of thought useful not only in a career, but in life.\nReturn to the top of the page\nConcentration Requirements\nFor juniors and seniors, course selections are approved, and course cards and course change forms are signed, by the departmental representative, who can perform some of the functions of an academic advisor--juniors and seniors do not have academic advisors as such--and refer students to other department faculty for further advice if desired. All students are encouraged to see the departmental representative in person at course selection time, and the following are required to do so: Sophomores entering the department; fall seniors selecting spring senior courses; spring seniors dropping departmental courses.\nCertain of a student's courses are designated departmentals, and the grades in courses so designated are the course grades used in computing the student's departmental average. The official designation of departmentals occurs during the fall of the senior year when selecting courses for spring of senior year: All designations before this time are provisional; after this time a designation cannot be changed merely in order to improve a student's average. All philosophy courses taken for letter grades junior or senior year must be designated departmentals, as must all courses used to fulfill departmental requirements. Designation of any other philosophy courses is optional.\nThe departmental course requirement is eight courses. Courses taken before fall semester junior year normally may be counted, including the prerequisite course; and up to two courses may be lower division (200-level or lower). Up to two courses in other departments may be counted as cognates, if approved as contributing significantly to the student's course of study; these must normally be courses completed before spring semester senior year. Further, six out of the eight courses must be so distributed that there are two in each of three out of the four areas (metaphysics; ethics & philosophy of value; logic & philosophy of science; history of philosophy) into which philosophy courses are divided; there is no such restriction on the remaining two out of the eight. The area classification of most courses is listed in the Undergraduate Announcement; for other courses the classification will be made by the departmental representative.\nStudents doing the senior thesis in certain interdisciplinary fields have the option of replacing the regular requirement of two courses in each of three philosophy areas by an alternative requirement. The political philosophy option involves using the quota of two cognates for courses listed under the Politics department as political theory courses and counting this in place of one philosophy area, and then doing two courses in the ethics & philosophy of value area, and two courses in some one other philosophy area. The philosophy of science option involves using the quota of two cognates for upper division courses in some one relevant science (e.g. mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, linguistics) and counting this in place of one philosophy area, and then doing two courses in the logic & philosophy of science area, and two courses in some one other philosophy area.\nFor students following the regular requirements, cognates require individual approval. Cognates may not be used for both courses in a distribution area (and standards for approval are generally more liberal for courses that are not used for distribution requirements than for courses that are, and again more liberal for a first cognate than for a second). In general courses considering means other than philosophical argument (e.g. appeal to religious revelation, tradition, authority, faith) have been used to answer questions of a kind considered in philosophy, and courses considering philosophical works from a non-philosophical standpoint (e.g. as literary texts, emphasizing rhetorical style, or as historical documents, emphasizing external influences) are considered valuable supplements but not substitutes for philosophy courses, and hence not suitable as cognates.\nCourses that have been routinely approved as cognates in recent years include: all courses listed under the Politics department as courses in political theory; most courses listed under the History department as courses in history of science; and a few courses listed under area studies programs covering those aspects of the intellectual history of certain non-Western civilizations that invite comparison with the history of philosophy in the West. Other courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis.\nReturn to the top of the page\nJunior Seminars\nFall semester junior year, independent work normally involves participation in a seminar of up to five students under the supervision of an instructor from the faculty of the department. The junior seminar is intended to provide a transition from course work to fully independent work. A junior seminar meets weekly for an hour or biweekly for two hours to discuss readings selected by the instructor, and each student writes a final paper of at least 5,000 words (about 20 pages) usually on a topic chosen by the student from a list provided by the instructor in the area defined by those readings. The student's grade for fall semester independent work will be mainly based on this paper but is usually partly based also on shorter papers and/or oral presentations in the seminar earlier in the term. (Most commonly the split is about 75%-25%).\nA listing of the junior seminar offerings available will be posted by the first day of fall semester. Note that there is no requirement for the junior independent work of a student intending to elect a special option (Philosophy of Science, Political Philosophy) to be on a topic relevant to that area; on the contrary, students are encouraged to do at least one semester's independent work outside that area. While the department undertakes to make a variety of junior seminar topics available each year, it does not undertake to provide one directly relevant to each special option each year.\nStudents will have a few days to report their preferences among the offerings and their schedules to the departmental representative. By the middle of the first week of classes, the placement of students in seminars will be posted by the departmental representative, and notice of the hour, day, and place (usually the instructor's office) of the first, organizational meeting of each seminar will be posted by the seminar instructors. Since this is when the regular meeting time for the seminar will be fixed, it is important to attend this first meeting, especially if the hour is one that would not be convenient as a regular meeting time.\nFinal papers for junior seminars are due the second day of reading period. This is a University deadline. Late work cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean. There is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the seminar instructor and the departmental representative.\nReturn to the top of the page\nJunior Papers\nSpring semester junior year, independent work consists of writing a junior paper, an essay on a philosophical topic, normally amounting to at least 5,000 words (about 20 pages), written under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\nOn the one hand, any member of the department faculty is eligible to advise a junior paper if willing to do so, except that a student may not have the same advisor for both semesters' junior independent work (fall seminar and spring paper). Students may find advisors on their own, by agreement with some member of the faculty. On the other hand, certain faculty are assigned by the chair of the department special responsibility for supervision of undergraduate independent work and constitute the Senior Thesis/Junior Paper Advising Panel. Students who do not find advisors on their own are assigned advisors from this panel by the departmental representative. By the end of the second week of classes spring semester, every junior should submit to the departmental representative either confirmation of an agreement about advising with some one member of the faculty, or else a list of several members of the panel by whom the student would be willing to be advised. Notice of advisor assignments will be posted early the next week of classes.\nJunior papers are due the second day of reading period. This is a University deadline. Late work cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean. There is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the seminar instructor and the departmental representative.\nReturn to the top of the page\nEarly Concentration and Foreign Study\nA student who has satisfied the prerequisite by the end of fall semester sophomore year may apply to become an early concentrator spring semester and begin independent work then. This option is especially recommended for students planning to be away on foreign study for either or both semesters junior year.\nStudents who, owing to absence on foreign study or late change of concentration, do not participate in a junior seminar fall semester junior year also make up that semester's junior independent work by writing an additional junior paper, usually over the summer.\nReturn to the top of the page\nSenior Theses\nSenior year independent work consists of preparation for the departmental examination and writing the senior thesis, an essay or group of related essays on a topic or group of related topics, amounting to at least 10,000 words (about 40 pages), and normally at most twice that, written under the supervision of a faculty advisor. A student electing a special option (Philosophy of Science, Political Philosophy) must write the thesis on a topic appropriate to that area broadly construed.\nOn the one hand, any member of the department faculty is eligible to advise a senior thesis if willing to do so. (Advising by outside faculty is also possible, subject to approval by the departmental representative.) Students may find advisors on their own, by agreement with some member of the faculty. On the other hand, certain faculty are assigned by the chair of the department special responsibility for supervision of undergraduate independent work, and constitute the Senior Thesis/Junior Paper Advising Panel (as mentioned above). Students who do not find advisors on their own are assigned advisors from this panel by the departmental representative. By the end of the second full week of classes fall semester, every senior should submit to the departmental representative either confirmation of an agreement about advising with some one member of the faculty, or else a list of several members of the panel by whom the student would be willing to be advised. Notice of advisor assignments will be posted early the next week of classes.\nA thesis proposal, consisting of a short paragraph describing the thesis project, mentioning several issues that will be pursued and several works that will be discussed, is due immediately after the fall recess. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nA thesis draft, consisting of some 3000 to 4000 words of written material towards the thesis, not necessarily in final form, is due immediately after winter recess, on the first day of reading period. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nThe completed thesis itself is due Monday the eighth week of classes spring semester. Two copies should be submitted to the undergraduate administrator in the department office. One copy, for eventual microfilming by the library, must be unbound (loose pages in a labeled envelope); the other, for eventual return to the student, is usually bound, though it is not required to be. There is a prescribed format for the title page and a copyright page. Samples will be available well in advance of the due date.\nThere is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the thesis advisor and the departmental representative. Requests for extensions on medical grounds must be supported by a note from University Health Services. Theses late past the University deadline (first day of reading period) cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean.\nThe thesis is read and graded by the student's advisor together with the student's departmental examination coordinator. The thesis grade (like the examination grade) is reported to the student, along with oral comments by the readers, and the student's copy of the thesis is returned, immediately after the student's departmental examination.\nA student who fails to submit a thesis, or who receives a grade of F on the thesis is ineligible for graduation. Information about thesis prizes is provided elsewhere.\nReturn to the top of the page\nSenior Departmental Exam\nSenior year independent work consists of writing the senior thesis and preparing for the departmental examination, a ninety-minute oral examination on an area of philosophy, defined by a syllabus of readings and to which the thesis topic belongs. (A student who feels that an oral examination will not sufficiently reveal his or her knowledge and abilities may take a written examination in addition to, but not instead of, the oral examination.) The examination is conducted by a member of the department faculty assigned as the student's examination coordinator, together with the student's thesis advisor.\nDepartmental examination coordinators are assigned by the departmental representative during the latter part of fall semester. The coordinator assists the student in developing an acceptable syllabus of readings for the examination. (Usually this involves no more than adding a couple of items to the developing thesis bibliography, so as to broaden the area a bit beyond the immediate focus of the thesis.)\nA completed examination syllabus, ready for approval by the examiners, is due immediately after spring recess. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nThe examination itself must be held at the latest on the last day of the period towards the end of spring semester (just after reading period) set aside in the University calendar for departmental examinations. It is the student's responsibility to confer with both examiners and reach agreement on the hour, day, and place (usually the examination coordinator's office) of the examination. These agreed arrangements are to be reported to the Undergraduate Administrator in the department office by Monday of the last week of classes. If arrangements are not completed by the student by that date, the examination coordinator is to confer with the thesis advisor and reach agreement on the hour, day during the period set aside in the University calendar for departmental examinations, and place of the examination, and report these agreed arrangements to the undergraduate administrator in the department office, who will notify the student.\nThe examination grade (like the thesis grade) is reported to the student, along with oral comments by the readers, immediately after the examination.\nA student who fails to submit a thesis, or who receives a grade of F on the thesis is ineligible to take the departmental examination, and receives a grade of I (incomplete) for it. A student who receives a grade of F on the examination after receiving a grade of D on the thesis is ineligible for graduation, unless the department faculty, on consideration of the student's overall academic record, votes to make an exception.\nReturn to the top of the page\nGraduation Prizes and Honors\nCourse grades and junior independent work grades are reported as letter grades, converted to number grades for purposes of computing averages:\nA+ = 98.75\n"}, {"score": 1647.3597, "uuid": "ad519b98-4882-5a27-8bd4-d2616ef92692", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1709wb-44-00719", "target_hostname": "philosophy.princeton.edu", "target_uri": "http://philosophy.princeton.edu/philosophy-majors/Print.html", "page_rank": 1.1803599e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>Philosophy</em> <em>Majors</em>", "snippet": "Do all events, including the choices <em>I</em> make, have causes?)

For concentrators, the regular option combines an expectation of substantial work on a diverse range of questions (at least two courses in each of at least three of the four branches of philosophy) with considerable freedom to pursue individual interests in independent work with faculty advisors; special options in interdisciplinary areas, such as political philosophy and philosophy of science, add flexibility by permitting the substitution of work in a relevant outside field for one area of philosophy.\nReturn to the top of the page\nPhilosophy and Your Future\nSince the opening of the first schools of philosophy in antiquity, many students of the subject have put their training in the analysis of argument and evaluation of evidence to work in a subsequent legal career; law schools have long recognized the value of an undergraduate major in philosophy. Increasingly other professional schools and employers have come to recognize it as well, and many of our recent concentrators have gone on successfully to work in medicine, journalism, business, or government. A few concentrators go on to graduate study in philosophy; those who do so generally achieve admission to top-ranked schools, with good fellowships.\nSkills acquired by concentrating in philosophy can thus be useful for a variety of careers. But the main benefit lies in learning to think in an organized way about confusing and controversial questions; to treat one's beliefs as serviceable as they are but capable of improvement; to react to criticism not with outrage or fear but with a willingness to state the grounds for one's views and to listen to and learn from the views of others. These are habits of thought useful not only in a career, but in life.\nReturn to the top of the page\nConcentration Requirements\nFor juniors and seniors, course selections are approved, and course cards and course change forms are signed, by the departmental representative, who can perform some of the functions of an academic advisor--juniors and seniors do not have academic advisors as such--and refer students to other department faculty for further advice if desired. All students are encouraged to see the departmental representative in person at course selection time, and the following are required to do so: Sophomores entering the department; fall seniors selecting spring senior courses; spring seniors dropping departmental courses.\nCertain of a student's courses are designated departmentals, and the grades in courses so designated are the course grades used in computing the student's departmental average. The official designation of departmentals occurs during the fall of the senior year when selecting courses for spring of senior year: All designations before this time are provisional; after this time a designation cannot be changed merely in order to improve a student's average. All philosophy courses taken for letter grades junior or senior year must be designated departmentals, as must all courses used to fulfill departmental requirements. Designation of any other philosophy courses is optional.\nThe departmental course requirement is eight courses. Courses taken before fall semester junior year normally may be counted, including the prerequisite course; and up to two courses may be lower division (200-level or lower). Up to two courses in other departments may be counted as cognates, if approved as contributing significantly to the student's course of study; these must normally be courses completed before spring semester senior year. Further, six out of the eight courses must be so distributed that there are two in each of three out of the four areas (metaphysics; ethics & philosophy of value; logic & philosophy of science; history of philosophy) into which philosophy courses are divided; there is no such restriction on the remaining two out of the eight. The area classification of most courses is listed in the Undergraduate Announcement; for other courses the classification will be made by the departmental representative.\nStudents doing the senior thesis in certain interdisciplinary fields have the option of replacing the regular requirement of two courses in each of three philosophy areas by an alternative requirement. The political philosophy option involves using the quota of two cognates for courses listed under the Politics department as political theory courses and counting this in place of one philosophy area, and then doing two courses in the ethics & philosophy of value area, and two courses in some one other philosophy area. The philosophy of science option involves using the quota of two cognates for upper division courses in some one relevant science (e.g. mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, linguistics) and counting this in place of one philosophy area, and then doing two courses in the logic & philosophy of science area, and two courses in some one other philosophy area.\nFor students following the regular requirements, cognates require individual approval. Cognates may not be used for both courses in a distribution area (and standards for approval are generally more liberal for courses that are not used for distribution requirements than for courses that are, and again more liberal for a first cognate than for a second). In general courses considering means other than philosophical argument (e.g. appeal to religious revelation, tradition, authority, faith) have been used to answer questions of a kind considered in philosophy, and courses considering philosophical works from a non-philosophical standpoint (e.g. as literary texts, emphasizing rhetorical style, or as historical documents, emphasizing external influences) are considered valuable supplements but not substitutes for philosophy courses, and hence not suitable as cognates.\nCourses that have been routinely approved as cognates in recent years include: all courses listed under the Politics department as courses in political theory; most courses listed under the History department as courses in history of science; and a few courses listed under area studies programs covering those aspects of the intellectual history of certain non-Western civilizations that invite comparison with the history of philosophy in the West. Other courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis.\nReturn to the top of the page\nJunior Seminars\nFall semester junior year, independent work normally involves participation in a seminar of up to five students under the supervision of an instructor from the faculty of the department. The junior seminar is intended to provide a transition from course work to fully independent work. A junior seminar meets weekly for an hour or biweekly for two hours to discuss readings selected by the instructor, and each student writes a final paper of at least 5,000 words (about 20 pages) usually on a topic chosen by the student from a list provided by the instructor in the area defined by those readings. The student's grade for fall semester independent work will be mainly based on this paper but is usually partly based also on shorter papers and/or oral presentations in the seminar earlier in the term. (Most commonly the split is about 75%-25%).\nA listing of the junior seminar offerings available will be posted by the first day of fall semester. Note that there is no requirement for the junior independent work of a student intending to elect a special option (Philosophy of Science, Political Philosophy) to be on a topic relevant to that area; on the contrary, students are encouraged to do at least one semester's independent work outside that area. While the department undertakes to make a variety of junior seminar topics available each year, it does not undertake to provide one directly relevant to each special option each year.\nStudents will have a few days to report their preferences among the offerings and their schedules to the departmental representative. By the middle of the first week of classes, the placement of students in seminars will be posted by the departmental representative, and notice of the hour, day, and place (usually the instructor's office) of the first, organizational meeting of each seminar will be posted by the seminar instructors. Since this is when the regular meeting time for the seminar will be fixed, it is important to attend this first meeting, especially if the hour is one that would not be convenient as a regular meeting time.\nFinal papers for junior seminars are due the second day of reading period. This is a University deadline. Late work cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean. There is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the seminar instructor and the departmental representative.\nReturn to the top of the page\nJunior Papers\nSpring semester junior year, independent work consists of writing a junior paper, an essay on a philosophical topic, normally amounting to at least 5,000 words (about 20 pages), written under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\nOn the one hand, any member of the department faculty is eligible to advise a junior paper if willing to do so, except that a student may not have the same advisor for both semesters' junior independent work (fall seminar and spring paper). Students may find advisors on their own, by agreement with some member of the faculty. On the other hand, certain faculty are assigned by the chair of the department special responsibility for supervision of undergraduate independent work and constitute the Senior Thesis/Junior Paper Advising Panel. Students who do not find advisors on their own are assigned advisors from this panel by the departmental representative. By the end of the second week of classes spring semester, every junior should submit to the departmental representative either confirmation of an agreement about advising with some one member of the faculty, or else a list of several members of the panel by whom the student would be willing to be advised. Notice of advisor assignments will be posted early the next week of classes.\nJunior papers are due the second day of reading period. This is a University deadline. Late work cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean. There is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the seminar instructor and the departmental representative.\nReturn to the top of the page\nEarly Concentration and Foreign Study\nA student who has satisfied the prerequisite by the end of fall semester sophomore year may apply to become an early concentrator spring semester and begin independent work then. This option is especially recommended for students planning to be away on foreign study for either or both semesters junior year.\nStudents who, owing to absence on foreign study or late change of concentration, do not participate in a junior seminar fall semester junior year also make up that semester's junior independent work by writing an additional junior paper, usually over the summer.\nReturn to the top of the page\nSenior Theses\nSenior year independent work consists of preparation for the departmental examination and writing the senior thesis, an essay or group of related essays on a topic or group of related topics, amounting to at least 10,000 words (about 40 pages), and normally at most twice that, written under the supervision of a faculty advisor. A student electing a special option (Philosophy of Science, Political Philosophy) must write the thesis on a topic appropriate to that area broadly construed.\nOn the one hand, any member of the department faculty is eligible to advise a senior thesis if willing to do so. (Advising by outside faculty is also possible, subject to approval by the departmental representative.) Students may find advisors on their own, by agreement with some member of the faculty. On the other hand, certain faculty are assigned by the chair of the department special responsibility for supervision of undergraduate independent work, and constitute the Senior Thesis/Junior Paper Advising Panel (as mentioned above). Students who do not find advisors on their own are assigned advisors from this panel by the departmental representative. By the end of the second full week of classes fall semester, every senior should submit to the departmental representative either confirmation of an agreement about advising with some one member of the faculty, or else a list of several members of the panel by whom the student would be willing to be advised. Notice of advisor assignments will be posted early the next week of classes.\nA thesis proposal, consisting of a short paragraph describing the thesis project, mentioning several issues that will be pursued and several works that will be discussed, is due immediately after the fall recess. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nA thesis draft, consisting of some 3000 to 4000 words of written material towards the thesis, not necessarily in final form, is due immediately after winter recess, on the first day of reading period. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nThe completed thesis itself is due Monday the eighth week of classes spring semester. Two copies should be submitted to the undergraduate administrator in the department office. One copy, for eventual microfilming by the library, must be unbound (loose pages in a labeled envelope); the other, for eventual return to the student, is usually bound, though it is not required to be. There is a prescribed format for the title page and a copyright page. Samples will be available well in advance of the due date.\nThere is a grade penalty of 1 point per weekday to a maximum of 10 (= a full letter grade) for lateness, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers require approval of the thesis advisor and the departmental representative. Requests for extensions on medical grounds must be supported by a note from University Health Services. Theses late past the University deadline (first day of reading period) cannot be accepted for grading by the department unless permission to do so is granted by the student's academic dean.\nThe thesis is read and graded by the student's advisor together with the student's departmental examination coordinator. The thesis grade (like the examination grade) is reported to the student, along with oral comments by the readers, and the student's copy of the thesis is returned, immediately after the student's departmental examination.\nA student who fails to submit a thesis, or who receives a grade of F on the thesis is ineligible for graduation. Information about thesis prizes is provided elsewhere.\nReturn to the top of the page\nSenior Departmental Exam\nSenior year independent work consists of writing the senior thesis and preparing for the departmental examination, a ninety-minute oral examination on an area of philosophy, defined by a syllabus of readings and to which the thesis topic belongs. (A student who feels that an oral examination will not sufficiently reveal his or her knowledge and abilities may take a written examination in addition to, but not instead of, the oral examination.) The examination is conducted by a member of the department faculty assigned as the student's examination coordinator, together with the student's thesis advisor.\nDepartmental examination coordinators are assigned by the departmental representative during the latter part of fall semester. The coordinator assists the student in developing an acceptable syllabus of readings for the examination. (Usually this involves no more than adding a couple of items to the developing thesis bibliography, so as to broaden the area a bit beyond the immediate focus of the thesis.)\nA completed examination syllabus, ready for approval by the examiners, is due immediately after spring recess. Two copies should be submitted to the Undergraduate Administrator.\nThe examination itself must be held at the latest on the last day of the period towards the end of spring semester (just after reading period) set aside in the University calendar for departmental examinations. It is the student's responsibility to confer with both examiners and reach agreement on the hour, day, and place (usually the examination coordinator's office) of the examination. These agreed arrangements are to be reported to the Undergraduate Administrator in the department office by Monday of the last week of classes. If arrangements are not completed by the student by that date, the examination coordinator is to confer with the thesis advisor and reach agreement on the hour, day during the period set aside in the University calendar for departmental examinations, and place of the examination, and report these agreed arrangements to the undergraduate administrator in the department office, who will notify the student.\nThe examination grade (like the thesis grade) is reported to the student, along with oral comments by the readers, immediately after the examination.\nA student who fails to submit a thesis, or who receives a grade of F on the thesis is ineligible to take the departmental examination, and receives a grade of I (incomplete) for it. A student who receives a grade of F on the examination after receiving a grade of D on the thesis is ineligible for graduation, unless the department faculty, on consideration of the student's overall academic record, votes to make an exception.\nReturn to the top of the page\nGraduation Prizes and Honors\nCourse grades and junior independent work grades are reported as letter grades, converted to number grades for purposes of computing averages:\nA+ = 98.75\n"}, {"score": 1640.7893, "uuid": "a5a452b0-91bd-5342-b84d-50ac48364464", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1015wb-90-19935", "target_hostname": "mechanism.ucsd.edu", "target_uri": "http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/~bill/teaching/w07/philpsych/index.html", "page_rank": 1.174572e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Philosophy</em> of <em>Psychology</em>, 2007", "snippet": "The course will focus on <em>major</em> research traditions <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em>, with a special focus on contemporary cognitive <em>psychology</em>.

Psychology majors make an intensive study of the content and methods of psychology in preparation for graduate training and later professional pursuits in the field. The knowledge and skills they acquire help them pursue careers in such fields as psychology, social work, counseling, management, human resources, public relations, sales, and health administration. Every student planning a major in psychology should begin the program in the freshman year, and should work closely with a departmental advisor. At Butler, the psychology major is integrated with an interdisciplinary liberal arts and sciences education.\nA major in Psychology (41 credit hours) consists of PS101/SW250/NW220/221, PS202, PS210, PS211, PS235, PS310, PS320, PS350, PS385, PS440, one 400-level seminar, one 400-level course, and one other psychology course at the 300-400 level. Psychology majors are encouraged to include courses in biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology as they plan their undergraduate career.\nThe Goals of the Curriculum\nto provide a substantial breadth of exposure to the psychological literature, endowing each student with a common core of psychological knowledge,\nto provide each student with basic methodological and computer skills,\nto provide an intensive, sophisticated knowledge of at least one specialty within psychology.\nFive seminar courses (taught on a rotating basis) enable the students to pursue their interests in advanced topics. They are: PS475: Seminar in Cognitive Psychology, PS476: Seminar in Biopsychology, PS477: Seminar in Social Psychology, PS478: Seminar in Developmental Psychology, and PS479: Seminar in Applied Psychology.\nEach seminar examines a major issue or theme within the designated field. However, the specific topic for each seminar will vary from semester to semester. For example, the Cognitive Psychology seminar may concern memory processes on one occasion, and language processes on another. Alternatively, a sixth seminar (PS491: Recent Literature in Psychology) may be taken to satisfy the seminar course requirement.\nThe Structure of the Major (Total hours required = 39 hours); PS101 is a prerequisite for almost all upper-level courses)\nContent Core (21-23 hours)\nPS101 Introduction to Psychology/SW250 Psychological Inquiry/NW220 Behavioral Science or NW221 Human Behavioral Measurement (3-5 hours)\nPS202 Learning (3 hours)\nPS235 Biological Bases of Behavior (3 hours)\nPS320 Life Span Developmental Psychology (3 hours)\nPS350 Social Psychology (3 hours)\nPS385 Cognitive Processes (3 hours)\nPS440 Psychology of Personality (3 hours)\nMethodological Core (9 hours)\nPS210 Research Methods/Statistics I (3 hours)\nPS211 Research Methods/Statistics II (3 hours)\nPS310 Advanced Statistics in Psychology (3 hours) NOTE: You should make every effort to take Statistics during your or junior year. AVOID TAKING THIS COURSE AS A SENIOR.\nAdvanced/Specialized Courses (9 hours)\nPS300-400 level course (3 hours)\nPS400 level course (3 hours)\nPS400 level seminar (3 hours)\nThe following elective courses may be useful for a psychology major:\n100-level elective courses:\nPS105 Careers in Psychology (1 hour credit; Pass/Fail). This course explores careers in psychology and related fields, and the preparation required for each field. This course counts for 1 hour credit toward the degree, but the credit does not apply toward the psychology major.\n300-level elective courses:\nPS305 Psychology of Gender (3 hours)\nPS333 Human Sexuality (3 hours)\nPS360 Industrial/Organizational Psychology (3 hours)\nPS391 Internship (1 hour; may be repeated up to 6 hours)\nPS396 Directed Research (1 hour; may be repeated up to 6 hours)\n400-level elective courses:\nPS415 Psychological Testing (3 hours)\nPS420 History of Psychology (3 hours)\nPS441 Abnormal Psychology (3 hours)\nPS443 Intervention in the Community/Psychotherapy (3 hours)\nPS475 Advanced Seminar in Cognitive Psychology (3 hours)\nPS476 Advanced Seminar in Biopsychology (3 hours)\nPS477 Advanced Seminar in Social Psychology (3 hours)\nPS478 Advanced Seminar in Developmental Psychology (3 hours)\nPS479 Advanced Seminar in Applied Psychology (3 hours)\nPS491 Recent Literature in Psychology (3 hours)\nPS496 Independent Study (1 hour; may be repeated up to 6 hours)\nPS499 Honors Thesis (3 hours)\nNote regarding course sequencing: It is not possible to prescribe a single sequence of courses for all students. Any student's course sequence will depend on that student's initial placement in mathematics, English and foreign language courses - and on whether that student has received credit for Advanced Placement Examinations or previous college courses. However, the sample schedule on Page 6 should serve as a general guide.\nDiscuss your interests and career/academic objectives with your advisor. It is important that you select courses which serve your specific needs, and help to attain your specific goals. A freshman course, PS105 (Careers in Psychology) is offered to provide you with information about psychology and related fields.\nAs a psychology major, you should attempt to complete as many of the University Core requirements as possible by the end of your sophomore year. You should also consider adding a major, a minor, or a concentration in another discipline (consistent with your future plans). You may complete a \"Combined Major\". The combined major is a specialized degree in which you take the \"core\" courses in each of two related fields. For example, the combined Psychology/Sociology Major provides strong preparation for a student interested in pursuing a graduate degree in psychology, social work, criminal justice, counseling, or law.\nCurrently, Psychology students may enroll in combined majors with Anthropology, Philosophy, and Sociology (either the Social Work or the Criminal Justice track).\nIn addition to your major in Psychology, we suggest that you complete another major (30-55 hours), a minor (18-24 credit hours), or a concentration (12-18 hours) in another discipline.\nFor more information regarding a career in psychology, the American Psychological Association has an online brochure that covers the differences among the various degrees available in psychology, types of careers, and what psychologists do. It is intended to help answer your questions about what it is like to work in psychology and what educational requirements are needed. It may be found at http://www.apa.org/students/brochure/index.html .\nMinors in Business Administration, Computer Science, a Modern Foreign Language or Philosophy are particularly good additions to a Psychology major. We encourage each psychology major to complete at least one semester of research experience in a professor's lab group (PS396, PS496), preferably starting as a freshman or sophomore.\nWe advise you to give serious thought to studying abroad, and to completing one or more internship placements. Those students considering graduate school in psychology should carry out an Honors Theses (PS499) and take the History of Psychology course (PS420).\nThe University Honors Program offers many interesting courses. If you are qualified for this program - and you find it interesting - take it. If you find it boring - don't take it just to make your transcript look good. You may qualify for either University Honors or Department Honors.\nPsychology Department Faculty and Staff\nAdministrative Specialist: Carol Montgomery\nAssociate Professors: Lineweaver, Martin, Padgett\nAssistant Professors: Giesler, Gingerich, O'Malley\n"}, {"score": 1623.6367, "uuid": "fff11777-482f-56de-9574-34e5e25ab034", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-18-32075", "target_hostname": "psychology.about.com", "target_uri": "http://psychology.about.com/od/psychology-student-advice/a/electives-for-psychology-majors.htm", "page_rank": 1.1850005e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Electives for <em>Psychology</em> <em>Majors</em>", "snippet": "Do you think it is a good idea to take such a wide variety of classes <em>or</em> <em>should</em> <em>I</em> just stick to the core <em>psychology</em> curriculum?

Your advisor can help you sort through all the requirements you need to fulfill in order to earn your degree and provide a clearer picture of the courses you should take. While your plans may changes over time, starting out with a solid understanding of what you will need to do in order to graduate is always a good idea.\nFocus on Required Courses First\nOf course, you will need to take classes to fulfill your school's general education requirements as well as your major's departmental requirements. General education courses usually include a certain number of credits of math, physical and biological sciences, writing and composition and social sciences. Beyond the general education and departmental requirements, you can then take elective courses based upon your interests.\nDuring your first year or two of college, you should concentrate on taking the required general education and major classes. If you end up filling your schedule with elective courses during the early years of your college education, you may find yourself scrambling to play catch up during your junior and senior year. By saving most of your electives for the third and fourth year, you'll be able to enjoy some fun and interesting courses when many of your required program courses are starting to get tougher and more challenging.\nRemember that not all schools and programs are the same. General education requirements may also vary depending on the type of degree you are earning. For example, Bachelor of Science degrees involve taking more science courses, while Bachelor of Arts degrees usually involve more liberal arts classes and often include a certain number of foreign language credits. Talk to your advisor to learn more about the differences between a B.A. and a B.S. in Psychology .\nWhile the requirements vary from program to program, but some of the most commonly required core psychology classes include:\nIntroduction to Psychology\n"}, {"score": 1616.6586, "uuid": "6f05441c-36f7-583f-93ed-160471cb669a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1807wb-44-19228", "target_hostname": "wordtrade.com", "target_uri": "http://wordtrade.com/science/psychology/philpsy.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Philosophy</em> of <em>Psychology</em>", "snippet": "Review Essays of Academic, Professional &amp; Technical Books <em>in</em> the Humanities &amp; Sciences The Routledge Companion to <em>Philosophy</em> of <em>Psychology</em> by John Symons and Paco Calvo (Routledge <em>Philosophy</em> Companions) is an invaluable guide and <em>major</em> reference source to the <em>major</em> topics, problems, concepts and debates", "explanation": null, "document": "Search\nPhilosophy of Psychology\nThe Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology by John Symons and Paco Calvo (Routledge Philosophy Companions) is an invaluable guide and major reference source to the major topics, problems, concepts and debates in philosophy of psychology and is the first companion of its kind.

The differences between these two books signal the changed character, as well as the dramatic expansion, of the field. In this introduction, we describe some of the prominent characteristics of the Companion and explain how it reflects the current state of the field.\nIn recent decades and across almost all domains in the brain and behavioral sciences, there has been a steady push towards multidisciplinary collaboration and cooperation. This development means that it has become increasingly difficult to draw nonarbitrary disciplinary boundaries between research programs. Philosophers of psychology have been influenced by and have responded to the growing interdisciplinarity of the psychological enterprise. As psychological research has become an increasingly inclusive endeavor, encompassing a broad range of inquiries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from molecular-level investigations to social and organizational psychology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 philosophy of psychology has grown well beyond its original set of core concerns. Today, the philosophy of psychology has its own agendas and is motivated by concerns which can be distinguished from those problems and questions that informed its roots in philosophy of mind. No longer is philosophy of psychology directed solely towards questions of rationality, modularity, nativism and intentionality. This is probably the most obvious change in the thirty years since the publication of Block's anthology.\nContemporary philosophers of psychology are engaged with one of the most intense and diverse projects in the history of science. Given the scale of psychological research today, it is useful to maintain some sensitivity to the broader intellectual context which informs our investigation into mental life. We believe that appreciation of the major positions which frame current debates is improved by attending to the historical development of the relevant concepts and methods. In this spirit, the purpose of Part One is to present the necessary historical background for the discussions which follow. It provides a selective tour of the relevant history of psychology and philosophy, moving from the origins of psychology in early-modern philosophy to twentieth-century debates between behaviorists and cognitivists. These essays should counteract\nthe tendency to see contemporary debates, especially those concerning representation and computation, as straightforward products of the cognitive revolution, allowing students to recognize that the issues at stake have their roots in discussions that date back well before the heyday of cognitivism in the 1960s and 1970s.\nPart Two explores the nature of psychological explanation and its relationship to various models of mental life. In the early 1980s, philosophers of psychology had settled into a consensus with respect to the demise of behaviorism and the centrality of cognitivist architectures. This model assumed a functionalist metaphysical framework, a computationalist approach to explanation, and a central role for representation. Part Two reflects developments in the intervening years, by presenting the more critical contemporary approach to psychological explanation, folk psychology and functionalism. Alternative explanatory frameworks to cognitivism are explained and defended in detail. Connectionism and the embodied/embedded framework not only represent novel approaches to cognitive architecture but also present fundamental challenges to the cognitivist views of psychological explanation. This plurality of explanatory frameworks is one of the hallmarks of contemporary philosophy of psychology. Furthermore, philosophers disagree as to precisely how we ought to characterize the target of psychological explanation. The elusiveness of the target of psychological explanation has direct methodological consequences regardless of one's favored model of mind. These challenges are discussed in detail in Part Two.\nPart Three reviews the well-known cluster of questions related to the nature of cognition and representation. The problems addressed here relate to both the architecture within which representational states are couched and to the possibility of naturalizing content. For the most part, these essays fall close to the subject matter of mainstream debates in the philosophy of mind. However, as described in Part Three, philosophers of psychology have also challenged the foundational assumptions which govern these debates.\nOne of the central concerns in the recent philosophy has been the difficulty of accounting for intentionality. Despite a variety of new metaphors and scientific developments, many of the traditional problems continue to be relevant. So, for example, whether psychological inquiry converges on a theory where minds are understood as symbol-manipulating machines, as statistically driven networks or as embodied-embedded systems, it still faces the philosophical problem of accounting for the role of representation in psychology. Whether one denies the reality of representation along behaviorist lines or rests one's account on some variant of cognitivism or its alternatives, the difficulty of explaining (or explaining away) the role of representation remains.\nPart Four reviews the principal problems which emerge from consideration of the relationship between psychology and its biological basis. The early days of computational functionalism encouraged philosophers to consider the choice of theories independently of the details of implementation. For philosophers of psychology the biological facts of cognition were more difficult to ignore. In recent decades, philosophy of psychology has moved away from a view which downplayed the significance of biological structures and constraints in the development of psychological theories.\nTechniques and insights from neuroscience have moved to the heart of psychological investigation. Philosophers have taken note of the import of the neurosciences. So, for example, modern theories concerning cognitive architecture and the nature of representation generally take a stand with respect to the relevance of constraints that result from the properties of the neural substrate.\nWhile neuroscience has loomed large in recent psychology, biology has figured in a range of other important ways in psychological inquiry. For decades, ontogenetic and evolutionary biological considerations have influenced psychological theorizing. These factors continue to shape discussions in philosophy of psychology. Thus, developmental and evolutionary considerations feature prominently in many of the chapters in this Companion. The contributions to Part Four reinforce the view that if one is seriously engaged with working psychology, it is no longer the case that one can safely ignore evidence from the biological sciences.\nWhile contemporary philosophy of psychology encompasses results from biology and the other sciences, purely philosophical considerations continue to figure centrally. As philosophers have shown, perceptual experience remains one of the most intractable problems for a theory of the mind. However, philosophy of psychology has access to resources which potentially hold the possibility of moving beyond the kind of impasses that plague unaided philosophy of mind. Unlike the metaphysically oriented literature of the 1990s, the strategy for addressing the problem of consciousness in philosophy of psychology involves direct engagement with empirical investigation into the nature of attention and perception. Philosophy of psychology supplements and constrains a purely metaphysical or phenomenological approach to the problem of consciousness. Rather than taking our intuitions as the sole data for a discussion of the nature of conscious experience, philosophers of psychology have a substantial inventory of scientific evidence to draw upon.\nA productive approach to consciousness involves breaking the problem into its components. Part Five surveys some of the ways that philosophers of psychology have pursued the divide-and-conquer approach to consciousness. Attention, introspection and the temporal components of experience are distinguished from the emotions. These, in turn are distinguished from perceptual experience in the sensory modalities and in dream states. By taking an incremental approach to the problem of consciousness, philosophers of psychology can attend more carefully to distinctions obscured by blanket terms like \"consciousness.\"\nPhilosophical curiosity extends well beyond the confines of debates over the nature of cognition, representation and consciousness. The kinds of concern that continue to bring philosophers to the study of psychology, often involve problems concerning personhood, moral agency and the nature of the good life. As the field matures, philosophers of psychology are connecting in substantial ways to moral philosophy. The contributions to Part Six demonstrate the relevance of philosophy of psychology to vital normative questions. Here, these questions are tackled directly and without apology.\nThe present volume reflects what we believe are some of the most fruitful lines of investigation in contemporary philosophy of psychology. Given the selection of topics and emphases, some words of justification may be in order. As we indicated above, this Companion is organized in a way which departs, to some extent, from more traditional accounts of philosophy of psychology. In the past, the field was thought to focus on four central notions: intentionality, rationality, nativism and modularity. While these topics are crucial and are covered in detail here, they do not exhaust the range of topics which now fall within the scope of the field. It is easy to understand why philosophers of mind emphasized these four topics. However, by including a selection of subjects which is more representative of the contemporary state of play, we are hoping that the broader philosophical community will be encouraged to recognize the rich diversity of contemporary philosophy of psychology. However, this volume is not intended solely for philosophers with an interest in matters of mind, but also for philosophically inclined psychologists. We hope that this volume provokes and stimulates psychologists and that they will find a great deal here that is directly relevant to their research.\nTo understand what philosophy of psychology has become and where it is headed, it is useful, once again, to orient ourselves by reference to Block's classic anthology. That anthology was divided into a volume of classic papers in philosophy of mind, followed by a sampling of important papers in philosophy of psychology. Much of the most important work in philosophy of psychology had been oriented towards the concerns of traditional philosophy of mind. So, for example, in his introductory essay Block emphasizes what he sees as the central conceptual innovation: the Turing machine. From the perspective of the late 1970s, the development of the digital computer held the promise of fundamentally reshaping our view of mental life. The prospect of a new approach to fundamental questions concerning rationality and intentionality drew many philosophers of mind to examine conceptual problems in psychology.\nOver the past three decades of philosophy of psychology, one of the most important developments has been the expansion in the range of themes and topics. Increasing interdisciplinarity in philosophy of psychology in the intervening years has meant that Block's characterization of the field as \"the study of conceptual issues in psychology\" is no longer satisfactory (p. 1). Today, the philosophy of psychology is more than simply the analysis of the concepts employed by psychologists. It has become a collaborative effort involving the contributions of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, engineering and other disciplines. As this volume shows, the collaborative turn has not subordinated philosophical investigation to the natural sciences; philosophers have not become the \"underlabourers of the sciences\" in Locke's sense. Instead, while retaining a focus on the problems that bring us to philosophy of psychology in the first place, the collaborative turn has meant an increasing sensitivity to the actual results, methodologies and practices of scientific investigation. Our choice of topics in this Companion reflects this collaborative approach.\nRelated Sites\n"}, {"score": 1539.4568, "uuid": "f23b8fd0-9025-5455-b8ac-81d1b17c1b13", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-97-29852", "target_hostname": "pnp.artsci.wustl.edu", "target_uri": "http://pnp.artsci.wustl.edu/undergraduate/major", "page_rank": 1.3437061e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Majoring <em>in</em> PNP | <em>Philosophy</em>-Neuroscience-<em>Psychology</em> Program", "snippet": "track-specific area: * LCC track: <em>Philosophy</em>, <em>Psychology</em>, Linguistics, <em>or</em> Anthropology V.", "explanation": null, "document": "Home / Undergraduate Program / Majoring in PNP\nMajoring in PNP\nPNP as a primary major ( Certification of the Major checklist)\nThe PNP major comprises two tracks. The Cognitive Neuroscience (CN) track integrates the study of higher brain functioning with behavioral research directed at understanding activities such as perceiving, attending, remembering, and acting. The Language, Cognition and Culture (LCC) track addresses the importance of language in human cognition, and the integration of cognition with one's cultural environment. You must opt for one of these tracks.\nBecause PNP core requirements are distributed among various disciplines, you are required as well to complete a depth requirement in one of PNP's core disciplines: anthropology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, or psychology. The depth requirement includes three upper-division courses selected from an approved list of courses in the pertinent department. This ensures that you attain some depth in a traditional discipline in the course of completing your PNP major, and puts you in a better position to pursue interdisciplinary work.\nRequirements for a PNP major\nWhat follows is a summary of requirements. Because PNP includes two tracks and involves courses in many departments, there is no simple way to list major requirements. A handy <PNP Major Checklist<link to PDF Major Checklist> is available as a PDF file. If you print a copy of the checklist, you can more easily trace your way through various options and the requirements for each. Majors are encouraged to print a copy of the checklist to facilitate keeping track of their progress through the major.\nI.\u00a0 Prerequisites. Majors are strongly encouraged to complete prerequisites prior to enrolling in upper-level courses unless they have received an explicit waiver from the instructor.\nPhilosophy: 100, 120, or 125\nPsychology: 100B\nII. Introductory Sequence. Successful completion of MBB 120 and 122, or\nPNP 200 and\nPNP 201 or Psych 301\nII. Core Requirements. These requirements must be met by students in both the CN and LCC track.\n6 credits of upper-division Philosophy courses (which have a lower-division Philosophy courses as a prerequisite), from a PNP-approved list\n6 credits of upper-division Psychology courses (which have Psychology 100b as a prerequisite), from a PNP-approved list.\nIII. Track-Specific Requirements. These vary depending on whether you are on the CN or LCC track\nCN track: Bio 2960 or Psych 3401 and Psych 3411 and Psych 3604\nLCC track: Ling 170D and either Ling 21512 or Anthro 160B plus\n6 units for LCC from PNP-approved list.\nIV. Depth requirement. Nine credits (three courses) at the 300- or 400-level (at least one course must be at the 400-level) in one track-specific area:\nCN track: Philosophy, Neuroscience, or Psychology\nLCC track: Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, or Anthropology\nV. The Capstone. If PNP is your first major, you are required to complete a capstone sequence. This is typically done in your senior year; last semester of junior year, at the earliest.\u00a0 A capstone can take the following forms:\n(A) PNP 390: PNP Reading Group (2 unit) PLUS PNP 495: PNP Seminar (3 units)\n(B) PNP 390: PNP Reading Group (2 unit) PLUS 3 units of PNP 500 Independent Work or the equivalent course in an affiliated discipline (Biol 500, Psych 500, etc.)\n(C) PNP 499: Study for Honors (6 units).\nIndependent Studies must be approved in advance. Please see Independent Study in PNP for details.\nHonors projects must be approved in advance, by the PNP Honors Coordinator. For details please see Honors web page.\nPNP as a Second Major\nPNP may be taken as a second major, in which case the requirements include I-IV above. Although not required to satisfy the Capstone requirement (requirement V), second majors are encouraged to do so. This option might be of particular interest to students with a first major in one of the allied disciplines. However, PNP can be combined with any first major: recent PNP graduates have had first majors in Drawing and Printmaking, Computer Science and Engineering, Economics, and French.\nSummer Courses\nCourses taken in summer school do not in normal circumstances count towards the PNP major. In exceptional circumstances they can count, but only subject to PNP administrative approval. Petitions are more likely to succeed for lower-level courses that are prerequisites for the major, rather than for upper-level courses satisfying the core, track-specific, or depth requirements.

Students should be interested in interpreting documents, constructing arguments, evaluating the coherence of their own and others' belief systems. They should want to learn about historical, philosophical and anthropological approaches to profound religious questions. Religious studies students are invited to think about religion, society and the world in which we live from a variety of perspectives. Religious studies is a pure academic discipline that requires no commitment to a particular religion or religious orientation, though it does not prohibit this, of course. Students who wish to pursue a career within a religion may also choose a more professionally-oriented course of study, pre-theological studies. This is a course of study that may have some elements in common with religious studies, but that is directed at producing people who are committed to their religion as a practicing professional.\nIs Religious Studies the right major for you?\nShare:\nWhat Courses Do Religious Studies Majors Take?\nThe required and elective courses you would take for Religious Studies majors vary considerably among institutions.

Schulz\nWhat Is Philosophy?\nA philosophy degree focuses on the \"nature of being,\" knowledge, and contemplating right and wrong in moral issues. It trains you to become disciplined and imaginative, and you'll learn how to reason through both profound and mundane questions. You'll practice forming an argument for debate. The principles of philosophy affect many other fields of study, such as physics and religion. Every religious belief and field of science is subject matter for philosophical inquiry.\nGood skills for a philosophy degree are attention to detail, a tendency to think way outside of the box, puzzle solving, debating, critical thinking and reading, and well-organized thought patterns. Independent students may wish to take online college classes in philosophy, so as to reason and write at their own pace.\nEmployers appreciate the finely tuned analytical skills of a philosophy major. This credential transfers well to many professions. With a philosophy degree at any level, you have proven yourself to be flexible and able to grow. Some of the more common career areas include business, journalism, computer science, public administration, healthcare, education, communication, and public relations. Philosophy degrees are often combined with other fields, and in order to teach at a college or university you will generally need a PhD.\nFind the right school for you\nDegree:\nProgram:\nDegree Programs in Philosophy\nA college degree in philosophy can focus on the traditional \"continental\" philosophy, in which you study the history of Greek and European philosophers, or on analytical philosophy, which deals more with mathematics, logic, and theoretical physics.\nAssociate Degrees & Bachelor's Degrees in Philosophy\nAt the associate and bachelor's degree level, you will likely study a bit of both branches so that you have a good understanding of how the philosophical approach has been used for centuries to contemplate issues and provide a forum for debate. Topic areas can include ethics (moral conduct), metaphysics (reality), epistemology (knowledge), and aesthetics (art). With that grounding, you can refine your skills to a more technical method of analysis. Online college courses in philosophy are available for the solitary thinker.\nWhat Can I Do With a College Degree in Philosophy?\nLooking for a job as a \"philosopher\" in the truest sense of the word can be frustrating, since the only listings you'll find are generally in academic positions at colleges and universities. However, your highly developed analytical and critical thinking and writing skills should be in high demand in a variety of industries. Many career postings ask for candidates with a liberal arts or humanities degree. In this case, a philosophy degree is advantageous because of the abstract reasoning and research background it provides. You might be suited for a career in:\nBusiness. The ability to look at old problems and processes in new ways is invaluable in the business world.\nWriting/Editing. There's always a shortage of people who are good at expressing themselves on paper (or online). Careers in journalism, marketing and advertising are excellent for good communicators.\nPublic service. Both politicians and career public servants benefit from the ability to identify, define and solve an astonishing variety of problems.\nLaw. Lawyers are really nothing more than philosophers trained in specifics of a country's legal system. Law students are famously subjected to a distinctly philosophical form of on-the-spot classroom quizzes known as the Socratic method.\nForeign service & diplomacy. The philosophical ability to discover unconscious assumptions and work around them is particularly important when working with people of different cultures.\nCertification, Licensure and Professional Associations\nThere is currently no universal form of certification for a philosophy degree holder, since the career choices tend to be so broad. There are, however, a large selection of professional and academic associations that an individual can join to receive current article submission, debates, and discussions with peers. The American Philosophical Practitioners Association , for example, offers certified memberships to experienced philosophical practitioners--group facilitators, client counselors, or organizational consultants--who meet certain requirements.\nExplore Related Degree Programs and Courses\n"}, {"score": 1492.1001, "uuid": "84b06f07-a26d-54b6-abfe-40d1ad884dda", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1312wb-03-17902", "target_hostname": "www.colgate.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.colgate.edu/academics/departments/philosophy/major", "page_rank": 1.3509857e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Colgate University : <em>Philosophy</em> <em>Major</em>", "snippet": "Students <em>should</em> plan to be done with one <em>or</em> both of their history courses by the end of their Junior Year.

At the end of the Proseminar, the faculty director, in consultation with other members of the department, will recommend certain students to rework their Proseminar paper into an honors thesis.\nAlthough the Proseminar is required of all honors candidates, it is by no means restricted to them; majors who would like the experience of doing guided independent work in a collaborative environment are encouraged to enroll.\n"}, {"score": 1484.9695, "uuid": "bfd66b25-0263-577a-9013-e09e391b0a3c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-31-03339", "target_hostname": "admission.wsu.edu", "target_uri": "http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7667", "page_rank": 1.2322924e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>Psychology</em> - <em>Majors</em> - WSU", "snippet": "Students can minor <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em> <em>or</em> obtain certificates <em>in</em> abnormal child <em>psychology</em> and helping skills. \u2022 Students may certify as a <em>major</em> after earning 30 semester hours, completing Psych 311 with a C- <em>or</em> better grade, and maintaining a cumulative GPA of 2.5 <em>or</em> better. \u2022 As early as possible <em>in</em> their", "explanation": null, "document": "Psych 311\u2014Elementary Statistics in Psychology\nPsych 312\u2014Experimental Methods in Psychology\nThree courses from Group I:\nPsych 372\u2014Intro to Physiological Psychology\nPsych 384\u2014Psychology of Perception\nPsych 390\u2014Operant Behavior\nPsych 401\u2014Historical Development of Psychology\nPsych 470\u2014Motivation\nPsych 473\u2014Advanced Physiological Psychology\nPsych 490\u2014Cognition and Memory\nTwo courses from Group II:\nPsych 321\u2014Introduction to Personality\nPsych 324\u2014Psychology of Women\nPsych 333\u2014Abnormal Psychology\nPsych 361\u2014Principles of Developmental Psychology\nPsych 363\u2014Psychology of Aging\nPsych 412\u2014Psychological Testing and Measurement\nPsych 440\u2014Clinical/Community Pshychology\nPsych 464\u2014Behavior Disorders of Children and Adolescents\nTwo courses from the following to complete the Writing in the Major [M] requirement:\nPsych 312\u2014Experimental Methods\nPsych 401\u2014Historical Development of Psychology\nPsych 440\u2014Clinical/Community Psychology\nPsych 473\u2014Advanced Physiological Psychology\nNote: See the WSU Catalog for degree requirements and talk with your academic advisor about planning and scheduling your courses.

To ensure that your submission is acceptable, your comment or question must demonstrate that you have done the reading in question and contain fewer than four grammar or spelling errors. These must be submitted as email to phil149@mechanism.ucsd.edu by 9 AM on the classes preceded by an asterisk in the schedule below (note, these are all Thursday classes except one on which there is an exam).

Completing a capstone experience for three hours is a requirement for the Major in Psychology. In order to be eligible to enroll in a capstone experience, students must have a grade point average of 2.2 or higher (except for Honors Research, which requires a higher grade point average and enrollment in the Honors Program).\nPsychology majors may not register for more than 15 hours of any combination of the following courses: PSY 287, 290, 291, 299, 390, 398, and IDS 395.093. Listed below are the capstone experiences that are available through the department.\nResearch Apprenticeship\nStudents should enroll in PSY 390 Advanced Research Apprenticeship for this capstone experience. PSY 390 must be completed with the same faculty member who supervised students in the prerequisite course PSY 290 Special Projects: Research Apprenticeship. Students learn about a faculty member's research project in PSY 290. In PSY 390, students assume greater responsibility for specific aspects of the research project. PSY 390 also requires students complete a final work product (e.g., write a research paper or present the research at the Undergraduate Research Symposium or a professional conference). Any research conducted by psychology students must comply with the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct of the American Psychological Association.\nThe availability of positions with faculty members research projects varies from semester to semester. Eligibility to enroll in PSY 390 depends on how many research experiences students seek and how well students fulfilled their responsibilities while enrolled in PSY 290.\nAfter completing PSY 290, students should ask faculty members if their research projects have positions for advance research apprenticeships. If a position is available, the student and faculty member should complete the PSY 390 Advanced Research Apprenticeship Contract . Click on the link to download the contract to the computer. The contract is an interactive Microsoft Word document that should be completed on the computer. If necessary, the contract can be saved and sent to the faculty member as an e-mail attachment. The completed contract should be printed, signed, and dated by the student and faculty member. The signed contract should be submitted to the department for approval. If the contract is approved, the department will also approve an override for the student to register for PSY 390. Students may not register for PSY 390 until the contract has been approved and the override has been processed. Students must register for the specific number of credit hours identified in the contract; otherwise, the registration will not be complete. If the PSY 390 Contract is approved after the first week of the semester, student must register in 107 Moulton.\nTeaching and Learning Apprenticeship\nStudents should enroll in PSY 391 Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Apprenticeship for this capstone experience. PSY 391 must be completed with the same faculty member who supervised students in the prerequisite course PSY 291 Special Projects: Undergraduate Teaching. In PSY 291, students assist a faculty member who is teaching a psychology course. Generally, this assistance is helping with class, tutoring, grading course material, and meeting to discuss with the faculty member issues that arise in teaching. In PSY 391, students design and evaluate a teaching project related to the faculty member's psychology course. This experience is especially useful to students who are interested in a teaching career.\nAfter completing PSY 291, students should ask the faculty member if they they have positions for advance teaching apprenticeships. The student and faculty member should complete the PSY 391 Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Apprenticeship Contract . Click on the link to download the contract to the computer. The contract is an interactive Microsoft Word document that should be completed on the computer. If necessary, the contract can be saved and sent to the faculty member as an e-mail attachment. The completed contract should be printed, signed, and dated by the student and faculty member. The signed contract should be submitted to the department for approval. If the contract is approved, the department will also approve an override for the student to register for PSY 391. Students may not register for PSY 391 until the contract has been approved and the override has been processed. Students must register for the specific number of credit hours identified in the contract; otherwise, the registration will not be complete. If the PSY 391 Contract is approved after the first week of the semester, student must register in 107 Moulton.\nSenior Seminar\nPSY 392 Senior Seminar is provided for students whose schedules do not allow them to take advantage of the other capstone opportunities. The topics discussed in Senior Seminar are variable, depending on the instructor teaching the course. The department strongly recommends students participate in one of the other capstone experiences where psychology is applied to teaching, research, and practice endeavors.\nProfessional Practice\nStudents should enroll in PSY 395 Professional Practice Seminar and PSY 398 Professional Practice: Psychology during the same semester for this capstone experience. PSY 395 is a seminar class that discusses assuming a professional identity and teaches students how to use psychological knowledge to help solve problems. PSY 398 provides students with an opportunity to earn academic credit for work experience related to psychology. This experience is available to all psychology majors, although enrollment is only possible if students are accepted for a Professional Practice position when they apply at community agencies or local businesses. Professional Practice placements are commonly referred to as internships, where the interns are supervised by professionals in the workplace. Internships are usually unpaid positions, although there are occasional exceptions.\nIn order to be eligible to register for PSY 395 and PSY 398, students must have completed at least 15 hours of psychology course relevant to the internship, have junior or senior standing as a psychology major, and have a grade point average of 2.2 or higher for all psychology -related coursework. Students must meet with Dr, Karen Mark, the coordinator of psychology internships. Students should be prepared to discuss their goals for the internship and identify possible community agencies or businesses. Dr. Mark will verify that students have completed the appropriate courses for potential internship sites.\nStudents are responsible for contacting an appropriate agency or business and meeting with a potential supervisor to discuss an internship position. After the student is accepted for an internship, the student and supervisor must complete and sign an internship contract. The contract, which is available from Dr. Mark, verifies the student's placement and supervision, and any specific information about the internship. The signed contract should be submitted to Dr. Mark. After Dr. Mark receives the signed contract, an override will be approved so that the student can register for PSY 395 and PSY 398. The internship may not begin until registration is completed and the semester has begun.\nStudents each one credit hour for every 40 hours worked at the internship, up to a maximum of three credit hours per placement per semester. Students will need to work at least 120 hours, during the semester, at the internship in order to receive three credit hours for PSY 398.\nStudents are required to submit a term paper on the last day of class for the semester. This term paper (at least five pages, word-processed, and double-spaced) should integrate the student's internship experience with relevant psychology coursework, focusing on how psychology courses material applies to the internship activities. The supervisor will also evaluate the intern's performance while at the internship. The grade for PSY 398 is determined by both the quality of the term paper and the performance evaluation.\nStudents should contact Dr. Karen Mark by e-mail for an appointment to discuss eligibility, placement, and registration procedures for an internship.\nHonors Research\nHonors students should enroll in IDS 395.03 Honors Thesis: Psychology for this capstone experience. Students should review the Honors Thesis website .\nIn order to register for IDS 395.03, students must complete the Honors Thesis contract with the faculty member supervising the research project. The contract is available from the Honors Office. The contract must be approved by the department and the Honors Program. After the contract has been approved, the Honors Program will give students a permit to register for IDS 395.03. The Honors Thesis contract must be returned to the Honors Office by the 15th day of the semester.\nIDS 395.03 requires students to complete an in-depth research project and write an Honors Thesis. Any research conducted by psychology students must comply with the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct of the American Psychological Association. At the end of the semester, students must present their research results at the Psychology Honors Colloquium. The Colloquium is presented to the department and is open to faculty, students, and the University community. Students should contact the Honors Coordinator, Dr. Jeff Wagman, by e-mail if they have any questions about Honors Research.\n"}, {"score": 1439.1963, "uuid": "090cce04-9606-5413-842a-63fec3939007", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1511wb-72-30632", "target_hostname": "alien.dowling.edu", "target_uri": "http://alien.dowling.edu/~cperring/phl142s02.html", "page_rank": 1.2678945e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Philosophy</em> of Psychiatry and <em>Psychology</em>", "snippet": "This class on the web: You will find this class on the web by going http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geocities.com&#x2F;cperring and <em>I</em> encourage you to use the links and discussion boards available on the class website.

These include confidentiality of patient\u0092s records, the duty of therapists to warn others about dangerous patients, the insanity defense, the right to refuse treatment, and the right of mental patients to parity of coverage from insurance companies and state programs with people who have physical illnesses. We will spend about half the semester on the following three issues:\nWe will look at the mind/body problem in philosophy, and its application in psychiatry, to the understanding of specific mental disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nWe will look also at the issue of freewill, and consider how it applies to addiction and compulsions. Can we make sense of a person having an irresistible craving? Does the \u0093philosophy\u0094 of Alcoholics Anonymous make sense? Should we blame addicts, alcoholics, and pedophiles for their actions, or treat them as ill?\nWe will look at the concepts of learning disabilities, mental retardation, and other forms of cognitive impairment, and consider the arguments of critics who have suggested that our educational authorities are now refusing to face up to the fact that some students are simply less intelligent and gifted than others. We will discuss whether learning disability is legitimate category of mental disorder, and what it implies for our treatment of children.\nThis class on the web: You will find this class on the web by going http://www.geocities.com/cperring and I encourage you to use the links and discussion boards available on the class website.\nLinks to useful websites: http://www.angelfire.com/ny/metapsychology/psypsylinks.html\nPrerequisites: Any two classes in Philosophy, Psychology, Anthropology, or Sociology.\nAttendance. There will be no class on Feb 7 or in the last week of February. To replace these, you must attend at least three of the Tuesday evening Speaker Series talks on The Medicalization of Childhood .

Arriving to class more than 15 minutes late loses you 0.5% of your total grade.\nYour grade: Students will write eight 500-word reflections on issues discussed in class, and will write a 12-page research paper; there will be a midterm exam and a final exam. Attendance 5%; Participation 10%; Midterm exam 15%; Final exam 20%; Reflection pieces 20%; Final paper 30%.\nExtra credit: Students can get 5% extra credit by doing a 15-20 minute presentation. This presentation must be of high quality: it cannot simply be read from a paper, it must be in the student\u0092s own words, summarizing ideas and explaining them clearly. Audiovisual aids can be useful, but should not dominate the presentation. If a presentation is not of high quality, the student will get no credit for it.\nReflection pieces: ~500 words each: these can be personal or abstract; they should discuss issues raised in class or in the readings.

It can be a survey of views in the field, or it can take a position and argue for it. It is essential that your paper address a controversial issue in the philosophy of psychiatry, and that it demonstrates an understanding of the main views taken by academics who have addressed this issue. All papers must be submitted electronically using http://turnitin.com . The class ID is 25031. I will tell you the class password in class.\nPlagiarism and Cheating. All research for papers must be carefully documented and footnoted. Minor plagiarism will result in you receiving a zero grade for the work. Major plagiarism will mean you fail the class.

Wrong! I quickly found out that going to school because you think you have to is the wrong decision to make. I withdrew 2 months into the semester realizing that I was miserable with my school and the course i was studying (HVAC). It is now 2 years later and now that I've had time to live on my own, work a little bit, learn the value of a dollar and see how hard life can be w/o an education the I make the decision to go back to school. I am not currently enrolled, but before I rush back into it I'm trying to find the right direction. Psychology or sociology seem to be the two I'm leaning toward.. More so psychology. Any information about what courses to take and/or not to take would be helpful. Still trying to find out where I fit in. And if you can get by with 2 years or do you need to go for 4 if you have any hope of doing something with your degree. Thanks for reading!\n\u2014Guest Tom\nWhy I'm Studying Psychology\nThis science is in charge of studying the human behavior and development. And those are the main reasons why I'm studying this beautiful career. Even though, it could take me few years to graduate, I believe I can find a job easily with this bachelor's degree. In addition, studying psychology have helped me to overcome personal issues as well as understanding others point of view.\n\u2014Guest Ana Gonzalez\nI have chosen psychology as my major...\nThis science is in charge of studying the human behavior and development.

If everyone understands human nature and behaviour, conflicts and stresses can be avoided. Understanding Psychology is simply understanding oneself and others. I wish Psychology must be included in high school curriculum so that young individuals might be aware and become sensitive of themselves and others' feeling.\n\u2014Guest josephine tiburcio\nMajor in Psycholgy\nPsychology is very interesting subject. I knew psychology since 8th class, however, I was at that time interested in medical field to become brain surgeon. After a long break I came back to school, and chose psychology to become brain doctor. Brain / cognitive is my favor subject that help to understand how people behave and why they have different thoughts and why act differently. In addition, the most of the health problems are produce by brain called and characterized as psychological disabilities. This way I could achieve my long lasting goal to become psychologist.\n\u2014salimqureshis\nPsychology: a passion, a solution\nPsychology is more than a mere subject; it is part of life, a way of life. What is more interesting, intriguing, breathtaking and fascinating as SELF DISCOVERY? Psychology is such that one can study and apply to his or her life even without practicing somewhere else. I have forever wanted to understand why people behave the way they do; why behavior follows a pattern; and how to correct behavior when it goes abnormal. I believe that the greater percentage of the problem of my community (Nigeria) and indeed the World, is more of psychological, and indeed I am committed to bringing a solution to this- along side other psychologist-in-the making. Psychology is everyday, it is wholesome and it brings people within. It gives you a sense of humanity I wish everyone was going to be a psychologist. Everyone would just have the basic knowledge of psychology and our society will be worthy of living. I hope to study the biological basis of behavior...psychology is worth being my major.\n\u2014Guest Dimka Philip\nA little jammed\nI'm a junior in highschool, and feel that right now I'm at the stage in my life where it is dire to choose a major. I know odds are it could change between now, and my freshmen year of college, but I find no other interest then in psychology. I plan to take AP psyc next year, for my senior year, and go to a college that is known for a strong programm in the matter. Any advice would be wonderful for what to expect, and perhaps colleges that have a good header when it comes to psychology. Thanks in advance. Perhaps not somewhere far from illinois, either?\n\u2014Guest Caitlin\nTo learn and improve\nPsychology is a course that has a lot of other sub-disciplines. I would like to learn a few of them for example those under developmental psychology and cognitive psychology. In addition to that improve my own behaviors as well.\n\u2014Guest NivL\nThe Best Combo of Philosophy and Science\nI always really loved philosophy and spent a lot of time pondering the imponderables. But my philosophy classes just weren't cutting it. I wanted to be able to have actual scientific evidence for the things I was learning about. Psychology really does seem like the best of both worlds. It explores a lot of the things I enjoy about philosophy, but actually backs up its claims with empirical evidence. Plus, its just an endlessly fascinating subject.\n\u2014Guest Rica\nI desire to be of help to mankind.\nMan is in trouble with what career to take, how can I understand my self, how can understand and cope with others, what is the solution to my educational problems, and what are my educational capabilities? These and more questions kept humanity on their toes, and psychology has an answer to man`s behavioral, career, educational and interpersonal problems. This humanitarian desire spur me to study applied psychology, educational guidance and counseling to be precise. I wish to pursue this course to Ph.d. level and teach it at University level in addition to researching more into human behavior and solution to human interpersonal relationship.\n\u2014Guest Onochie\nPsychology ties together many things\nI looked at myself one day not understanding why I did what I did nor why others do what they do. I kept looking and before you know it, psychology called to me, like something I have always known that I should do. People are important and no matter what background they come from or circumstances that have befallen them, sometimes just one person who open-minded enough to take the time to understand each and everyone of us is all that is needed. I plan to try to be that individual to the best of my ability......\n\u2014Guest Double O. Seven\nTo learn one's self and teach others\nStudying psychology is selfish in some aspect, as it gives you the tools to analyze yourself. Through my studies and personal research - I have gained great insight into \"me!\" Learning about myself allows me to further learn about others, as studying psychology gives you a deeper understanding of the human condition. It is a well-rounded major that pulls from all other majors. I look forward to attending graduate school, but I am in search of a program that combines clinical and counseling psychology - therapists should be trained as both clinicians and researchers, as their is a gap between research and applying effective treatment. It seems that the future of psychology holds that therapist will only have master degree's and Doctor's will be conducting research. Therefore, obtaining a PhD maybe not be financially advisable, unless one wishes to conduct research.\n\u2014Guest Alicia\nI want to know more about behavior\nI want to major in psychology because I want to know about complex creatures that human beings are. I want to identify behavior (overt or covert), mental process, much about sexuality, personality, memory, social relationships, creativity, human development, the mind-body relationship and so on. But since I am in Africa at Ethiopia, I can not get more materials, articles and journals of psychology even if I am psychology teacher at one Ethiopian university at bachelor level. I hope I am trying scholarship to upgrade my degree to Masters level. Thank you.\n\u2014Guest Minichil yesmaw\nThank you\nThanks for that insight because I am actually in the same position right now I am taking a psychology class and I really like the material but I am not sure what I want to do with my future. I have been to 3 schools so far and Planning on leaving the one I am currently attending. I am going to attend community college and I believe psychology is what I would like to major in. It feels good to know that I am not alone in my search for purpose.\n\u2014Guest a barrat\nPsychology Is Interesting!\nI wasn't sure what I wanted to major in when I first started college, so I tried to take classes in as many subjects as possible. Psychology just seems the most interesting. So many disciplines (history, English lit, life sciences) are focused on gaining a better understanding of human beings, but psychology seems like it does the best job. It covers so many interesting topics. I'm still not 100% sure what I want to do when I'm done with school, but I definitely want to keep studying psychology!\n\u2014Guest Rararachelle\n"}], [{"score": 1371.2485, "uuid": "c8b8f3a4-2ebc-5d80-ab7a-0f4996d6da74", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1810wb-68-12221", "target_hostname": "www.science20.com", "target_uri": "http://www.science20.com/curious_cub/should_evolutionary_psychology_evolve-81112", "page_rank": 1.1765321e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Should</em> Evolutionary <em>Psychology</em> Evolve?", "snippet": "Darwin <em>in</em> Mind: New Opportunities for Evolutionary <em>Psychology</em>.

In me, that phase never really ended. Needless to say...\nGunnar De Winter\nEvolutionary psychology is a field that examines human psychological traits through evolutionary glasses. Most human psychological traits are considered adaptations, the functional products of natural or sexual selection. This is tidily summarized in a quote from Cosmides and Tooby, two of the founders of the field:\nOur modern skulls house a Stone Age mind.\nThe field, however, is quite controversial. Proponents tend to explain every aspect of the human psyche through evolutionary adaptation, whereas opponents often express the criticism that these are \u2018just-so stories\u2019. Between these two positions, of course, many more moderate ones are possible.\nNow, a publication in PLoS Biology argues that evolutionary psychology itself should adapt to the knowledge gained from new findings in a variety of fields, ranging from evolutionary biology to cognitive neuroscience. Firstly, the authors identify the four basic tenets of evolutionary psychology.\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness (or EEA). Basically, the idea that our modern psychological mechanisms have evolved in response to stable features in the environment of our ancestors (assumed to be the African Pleistocene savanna).\nGradualism.\u00a0According to evolutionary psychologists, our minds are built from co-adapted gene complexes that are unable to respond quickly to changes.\nMassive modularity. Since different adaptive problems require different solutions, the mind is assumed to consist out of different modules, eahc dealing with a different problem.\nUniversal human nature. The evolved computational programmes in our brains produce a universal human nature.\nThen, the authors continue with a reassessment of these four basic tenets in light of new evidence. For example, they quote evidence that the EEA wasn\u2019t nearly as stable as previously thought, but rather a very variable environment, challenging the notion that our modern psychological mechanisms were formed in a stable EEA.\nContinuing, evidence is presented that there has been substantial genetic change in human beings, even in the last 50,000 years. There is even evidence suggesting that recent human evolution has been affected by human-induced changes in the environment (such as diet, or living conditions). These rapid changes are a challenge for the gradualism, as interpreted by evolutionary psychologists.\nTo challenge the idea of universalism, the authors cite evidence stressing the \u2018malleability\u2019 of the human brain, meaning that experience affects neural circuitry and gene expression in that remarkably complex center of the nervous system. The influence of development is equally stressed, as is the view that the human brain is built through continuous interplay between the individual and the environment. Gene-culture coevolution is also mentioned, signifying that cultural practices could have influenced selection pressures on the human brain.\nFinally, massive modularity is questioned, through the existence of domain-general mechanisms (such as associative learning, which is fairly widespread in the animal kingdom), and through the broad involvement of diverse neural structures in many psychological processes.\nAfter this reassessment, the authors offer some advice on how evolutionary psychology could adapt to all this new evidence.\nThe evolution of a character can be evaluated through the construction and testing of population genetic models, estimating and measuring the responses to selection, exploring the covariation of phenotypic traits or genetic variation with putative selective agents, and so forth, much as evolutionary biologists do.\nThe new evidence suggests that human beings experience less adaptive lag (being adapted to an environment in the past, and not to the present one) than previously supposed. An examination of the relationship between evolved psychological mechanisms and reproductive success in modern environments might help in elucidating this. Analyses, optimality models and gene-culture coevolutionary models could also be used to research whether or not current human behavior is adaptive in present-day environments.\nThe hypotheses of how the brain works can be compared to (cross-cultural) neuroscientific research, to see if this supports the hypotheses. Also, the genetic influence on brain formation and functioning could be involved here.\nThrough the use of developmental genetics and psychology, the unlearned roots of cognition might be detected. This could also help in understanding how culturally and individually dependent concepts emerge.\nThe authors conclude:\nNone of the aforementioned scientific developments render evolutionary psychology unfeasible; they merely require that EP should change its daily practice. The key concepts of EP have led to a series of widely held assumptions (e.g., that human behaviour is unlikely to be adaptive in modern environments, that cognition is domain-specific, that there is a universal human nature), which with the benefit of hindsight we now know to be questionable. A modern EP would embrace a broader, more open, and multi-disciplinary theoretical framework, drawing on, rather than being isolated from, the full repertoire of knowledge and tools available in adjacent disciplines. Such a field would embrace the challenge of exploring empirically, for instance, to what extent human cognition is domain-general or domain specific, under what circumstances human behaviour is adaptive, how best to explain variation in human behaviour and cognition. The evidence from adjacent disciplines suggests that, if EP can reconsider its basic tenets, it will flourish as a scientific discipline.\nReference\nBolhuis, J.J.; Brown, G.R.; Richardson, R.C. and Laland, K.

Ralph Blumenau examines some theories.\nIn recent years there has been a growing interest in the personalities of philosophers, and this has been both satisfied and stimulated by the publication of several well-written biographies. Danny Postel in the Chronicle of Higher Education (7 June 2002) discussed this phenomenon and provided a list of such books. One of those he mentions is Ben-Ami Scharfstein\u2019s The Philosophers: Their Lives and the Nature of their Thought (Oxford 1980). But Scharfstein\u2019s was preceded many years ago by what I think is a much more interesting, if perhaps more controversial, book: Alexander Herzberg\u2019s Zur Psychologie der Philosophie und der Philosophen (Leipzig 1926), published in English by Kegan Paul in 1929 under the title The Psychology of Philosophers, and republished in 1999 by Routledge (at \u00a370!) In this article I will first summarize their findings and then add some reflections of my own.\nHerzberg studied the personalities of thirty philosophers, thirteen of whom also figure in Scharfstein\u2019s list of twenty two. What emerges from the two studies is that a striking number of these thirty nine philosophers lost one or both parents before the age of seven; were ineffective in their social relationships; complained of social isolation and loneliness; were paranoid or hypochondriacal; suffered from more or less prolonged periods of clinical and even suicidal depression; were unmarried; were notoriously aggressive in contact with others; were quarrelsome and quick to take offence; were usually ineffective in practical and financial matters; and were interested in the very things they were not good at (such as politics and ethics).\nThe reason I consider Herzberg\u2019s book the more interesting of the two is that he goes beyond listing characteristics to advance hypotheses, which include the following:\n\u2022 It is not that philosophers are ineffective in practical affairs because they are so busy with higher thoughts, but that they occupy themselves with higher thoughts because these are a displacement of inhibited practical actions.\n\u2022 Most people are interested in thought processes because they lead to practical action, but philosophers are interested in thought processes only because they lead to other thought processes. Many philosophers extol contemplation as such and deride involvement with the world.\n\u2022 Many have strong religious interests, which are treated by Herzberg as being an overflow of energy from their philosophical interests and also as the result of inhibitions in their practical lives.\n\u2022 Philosophers who concern themselves particularly intensively with questions of God, Free Will and Immortality are moved by their psychological anxieties, and not just by their intellectual curiosity.\n\u2022 Idealist philosophers in particular tend to deny the real existence of a world with which they cannot cope (and materialist philosophers compensate on the other side!)\nNow, I have some reservations about the conclusions one might draw from both Herzberg and Scharfstein. The first one is that there is no control group to compare with the group of philosophers. A random sample of humanity might very well display a similar breakdown in many of the personality traits listed. For example, one wonders how many political journalists (not to mention ordinary people who pontificate about politics) would themselves be competent politicians, or what proportions of a random sample of the population would be inhibited in some way or other, be socially ineffective, financially incompetent, depressed, aggressive, or quick to take offence.\nWhat one thinks of Herzberg\u2019s hypotheses may depend to some extent on one\u2019s attitude to Freudian explanations. Although Herzberg\u2019s book is called The Psychology of Philosophers, there seems to be a suggestion that he actually considers philosophical activity as likely to be psychopathological (and the suggestion is also present in Scharfstein\u2019s book.) I think that a more nuanced approach would be helpful. What is important, surely, is not whether the personalities of philosophers show signs of psychopathology, but whether these signs are present in their ideas. The neurosis of a philosopher may show itself in the very form and content of his philosophy, but it may also have no bearing on either of these things. Rousseau\u2019s undoubtedly pathological personality and his inability or unwillingness to bring up his children, for example, do not in themselves make his theories on education pathological.\nI would divide the concerns of philosophers into three groups:\n\u2022 \u2018Normal\u2019 intellectual concerns - the kind that exercise every reflective person.\n\u2022 \u2018Normal\u2019 religious concerns - the kind that exercise most ordinary people who believe that there is a God.\n\u2022 \u2018Abnormal\u2019 concerns whose very nature seems (to me at least) to carry strong pathological overtones.\nWhat, then, would I describe as \u2018normal\u2019 intellectual concerns?\n\u2022 The attempt to find some kind of order behind apparent chaos.\n\u2022 The attempt to find some meaning in life.\n\u2022 The attempt to understand why people behave in the way they do. This is the subject matter of psychology which, before it split away into a separate discipline, was a branch of philosophy.\n\u2022 The attempt to understand the mechanism and reliability of our knowledge: epistemology.\n\u2022 The attempt to work out a code of conduct, which includes an attempt to work out a hierarchy of values: ethics and (for the latter) aesthetics.\n\u2022 The attempt to work out the proper relationship between individuals and the State, and how the State should behave towards individuals: political philosophy.\n\u2022 The attempt to extrapolate from known and working principles to what is still unknown (for example in physics, which was once known as natural philosophy).\n\u2022 The attempt to work out rules of clear thinking, including latterly a precise examination of the words we use: logic and linguistic philosophy.\n\u2018Normal\u2019 religious concerns seem to me to be:\n\u2022 The attempt to square Reason with those emotions called religious perceptions or faith.\n\u2022 The attempt to come to terms with the existence of Good and Evil.\n\u2022 The attempt to come to terms with the Unknown.\nNow I turn to \u2018abnormal\u2019 or pathological concerns. I am aware that some people will not be happy with what I include under this heading.\n\u2022 The reluctance to accept uncertainty. I believe that it this fear of uncertainty which has made so many philosophers, from Pythagoras to Russell, see mathematics as the paradigm of all philosophy. Closely related to this, it seems to me, is the attempt to impose scientific principles on all philosophy.\n\u2022 The search for a totally comprehensive system, especially Monism, but also Dualism (in which everything is either one thing or another) or Triadism (arranging everything in neat patterns of three, such as we find in Kant or Hegel).\n\u2022 Excessively authoritarian, revolutionary, optimistic or pessimistic systems which either ignore or suppress ideas that are outside the system. This is another version of the desire for certainty and of the inability to tolerate the uncertainty generated by open-minded debate.\n\u2022 Mystical philosophies. This is probably the most controversial of my suggestions. I certainly would not describe all mystical experiences as pathological (though I suspect that many are); but I feel that it is almost a contradiction in terms to reduce such experiences to philosophies. It seems to me no coincidence that so many mystical philosophies produce schematic diagrams which try to impose the same kind of artificial neatness and which we see in Monism, Dualism and Triadism.\nA final comment: although I have described the concerns in this group as \u2018abnormal\u2019 or psychopathological and although I am personally not much in sympathy with their embodiment in philosophy, it does not follow that the insights resulting from them have not been valuable. We know that the ideas of \u2018abnormal\u2019 individuals often have a kernel, or more than a kernel, of truth in them. So one might ask why one should bother about distinguishing between normal and abnormal concerns: what matters in the end is the value of the ideas. The distinctions are of interest to people who are interested in psychology. They are not really of major concern to philosophers as such.

The root of the term, transpersonal or literally \"beyond the mask,\" refers to this self-transcendence'\n- John Davis ,\nHistory\nTranspersonal Psychology grew out of the rejection of the mechanistic or behaviorist model of the mind which was the orthodoxy of the mid-twentieth century academic establishment . Charles T. Tart refers to this orthodoxy when describing his college experience in the 1960's:\n'As to things like mystical experiences, if they were mentioned at all, which was rare, they were relegated to the fringes of psychiatry as being undoubtedly schizophrenic in nature and just showed how sick religions were to be associated with superstitious nonsense like that.\nReal people in real life were still having transpersonal experiences of course, but they didn't speak of them around psychologists unless they wanted to be referred for treatment for psychopathology...'\nGradually, the climate of opinion has changed. And the mind (as distinct from being an epiphenomenon of matter) has been rediscovered.\u00a0 A number of reasons for this development have been suggested:\nThe experiences of the 60's generation with mind-expanding substances.\nGrowing familiarity with meditational techniques which offer a glimpse of the non-physical nature of the mind .\nThe failure of Artificial Intelligence to deliver. Computers can model and simulate any physical system but they do not appear to be able to simulate the mind .\nA gradual realisation of the participatory nature of reality, as the implications of quantum physics have become more widely disseminated among non-physicists.\nHowever, although there is general ageement among Transpersonal Psychologists that the mind is something more than a physical machine, \u00a0models of the mind still remain vague.\u00a0 It is hoped that this webpage, while not offering many answers, may at least define what kinds of questions can sensibly be asked, in particular:\nIs there one Universal Mind or are there many individual minds?\nThe Buddhist influence has always been strong within Transpersonal Psychology, and it is perhaps worthwhile considering the Buddhist teaching that one should avoid defilement by 'stains of conceptions of the eight extremes' [1] . The particular extremes which apply to conceptions of the mind(s) are:\nThe extreme of plurality.\nThe extreme of singularity.\nThe Extreme of Plurality states that our minds are separate from the divine mind and from one another.\u00a0 The Extreme of Singularity states that there is one all-encompassing divine mind.\nThe Extreme of Plurality\nThe Extreme of Plurality is illustrated by the dogmas of all the repressive religions ( memes ), that the mind of God is separate from the souls of his creatures.\u00a0 The world is a sorting machine. God feeds the souls in at one end, and life sorts them out into those which are fit to be united with the mind of God, and those which are to be rejected. (This results in a logical contradiction -\u00a0 If God is omniscient, why does He need to put souls through the Quality Control system in the first place. Presumably he knows in advance where they're going to end up before they enter the sorting machine).\nThe Extreme of Singularity\nThe Extreme of Singularity comes in two versions - Solipsism and Pantheism.\nSolipsism\nSolipsism states that my mind is all that exists and all other phenomena, including other people, are illusions. Life is a dream. Solipsism is impossible to disprove, though it isn't a very popular belief. Solipsist Associations don't attract many members, probably because most solipsists don't go around trying convert other people.\nPantheism\nPantheists believe that all is ensouled. The Mind of God is everywhere. Consciousness resides throughout the universe in humans, animals and also in inanimate objects such as trees,\u00a0 tomatoes, rocks and thermostats ( thermostats ! - You think I jest?). Of course, if mind is in all objects, then there is little to differentiate it from matter, and the concept of mind becomes meaningless.\nFrom a Buddhist point of view, an ordinary object could not be said to partake of \u00a0 mind unless it were sentient , which at the lowest common denominator means it is capable of experiencing dukkha .\n'A paradox! A paradox! At commonsense she gaily mocks...'\nSo we have a paradox. When we try to enumerate mind in terms of one or many, or separation or identity with the divine, we end up with logical contradictions, meaninglessly vague definitions, or solipsism.\u00a0 Don't these Buddhists just love paradoxes!\nWe could accept the paradox in the way that we have to accept that an electron is both a particle and wave.\u00a0 We could say that mind is both one or many. Fortunately, there is another way out. We could take the view that the concept of number does not apply to mind(s). Crazy?\u00a0 No it's actually a respectable mathematical theory due to John von Neumann, one of the pioneers of computer science.\nMind is the source and origin of enumeration.\nMind(s) is/are the source and origin of enumeration. It/they therefore cannot\u00a0 be enumerated.\nVon Neuman's theory relies on simple manipulations of sets:\nA set is a collection of things.\u00a0 An empty set is a collection of nothing at all. \u00a0\u00a0 An empty set can be thought of as nothing with the potential to become something (that is to be become a set with at least one member).\nVon Neumann proposed that all numbers could be bootstrapped out of the empty set by the operations of the mind:\nThe mind observes the empty set. The mind's act of observation causes the appearance another set - the set of empty sets. The set of empty sets is not empty, because it contains one non-thing - the empty set. The mind has thus generated the number 1 by producing the set containing the empty set.\nNow the mind perceives the empty set and the set containing the empty set, so there are two non-things. The mind has generated the number 2 out of emptiness. And so it goes on all the way up.\nStated stepwise the operation is:\nSTEP 0\u00a0 {} Empty set has 0 parts.\nSTEP 1\u00a0 { {} }\u00a0 Mind generates set containing empty set, which has one part.\nSTEP 2 { {}, { {} }} Mind generates set containing two parts, the set and the set containing the empty set.\netc, etc\nSo the entire number system, from zero to infinity,\u00a0 is generated purely and simply by the play of mind on emptiness , in the complete absence of the need to refer to any material objects being counted.\nThe philosphical implication of these findings is that mind ontologically precedes number. In other words in the ground of being, mind is more fundamental than number. Asking 'How many minds are there?'\u00a0 is putting the cart before the horse. It is equivalent to asking 'What is the color of electromagnetism?'\u00a0 Transpersonal mind is transnumeral mind.\nConclusion\nMind(s) is/are the source and origin of enumeration. It/they therefore cannot\u00a0 be enumerated.\u00a0 Understanding that existence is neither the extreme of one mind, nor the extreme of many minds, makes Buddhist practices - such as tantra, exchanging self and others, receiving blessings from enlightened beings, and generating great compassion - easier to understand. It also explains why the operations of the mind(s) are non-computable (ie non-algorithmic ).\n- Sean Robsville\n[REF 1] 'Eight Steps to Happiness' Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, Tharpa Publications Ulverston, 2000, ISBN 0 948006 65 x, Pages 201 - 203\nSee also:\n"}, {"score": 1352.2365, "uuid": "4698af92-1e9b-5ebb-a152-ccc3a083cd86", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-02-03045", "target_hostname": "students.sfu.ca", "target_uri": "http://students.sfu.ca/calendar/criminology/crim_psyc_joint_maj.html", "page_rank": 1.1891536e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Joint <em>Major</em> Program, Criminology and <em>Psychology</em>", "snippet": "If a student is unable to obtain the required grade <em>in</em> these courses, he <em>or</em> she will not be able to graduate with a <em>major</em> <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em>.

Only courses taken for a letter grade can be credited toward the major or minor.\nWhat grade do I need to receive in order to receive credit towards the major?\nA grade of a C- or higher is required of all courses that count towards the major.\nHow do I figure the GPA for my PNP major?\nTo figure your GPA in the PNP major: use all PNP courses taken towards the major, excluding prerequisites.\nCan PNP majors spend time abroad during their junior year?\nYes. PNP has a study abroad program at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Full details are available on the PNP <study abroad webpage<link to study abroad page>.\nI think I've found a course that is relevant to my PNP major but is not cross-listed in PNP. Can I take it towards my PNP major?\nYou will need to contact the PNP administrator who can consider such requests on a case-by-case basis.\nCan summer courses count towards my PNP major?\nCourses taken in summer school do not in normal circumstances count towards the PNP major. In exceptional circumstances they can count, but only subject to PNP administrative approval. Petitions are more likely to succeed for lower-level courses that are prerequisites for the major, rather than for upper-level courses satisfying the core, track-specific, or depth requirements. No course will be considered unless it is taught by a regular, full-time member of the faculty.\u00a0 Please include univeristy/college, syllabus, and your grade in your email request .\nHow does the MBB program count towards the PNP major?\nMBB 120 and MBB122 count as an introductory sequence for the PNP major, so, if you have completed these classes, there is no need to take either PNP 200 (Introduction to Cognitive Science) or PNP 201 (Inquiry in the Cognitive Sciences).\nStudents passing MBB 120 with a grade of B- or higher can satisfy the core Psychology requirements by taking 2 courses from the approved list that need not include PNP 360 (Cognitive Psychology) nor PNP 433 (Psychology of Language).\nMBB 300 counts for 3 units of credit towards either the Psychology core requirements or either the Psychology or Neuroscience depth requirement. You will need <administrative approval<link to PNP@wustl.edu> of the subject matter.\nThe Cognitive Neuroscience course is currently listed as a 400-level course that is writing-intensive. Will I be able to take the course, if I am not a Psychology major?\nThe 400-level course is a WI (Writing Intensive) course for Psychology majors. The Psychology department have committed to keeping Cognitive Neuroscience available as a 300-level course for PNP majors.\nDo I need to do a capstone experience as a PNP major?\nThat depends upon whether you are taking PNP as a primary major or as a second major. For students graduating with PNP as a primary major the capstone experience is mandatory. For students taking PNP as a second major the capstone is highly recommended, but not required.\nWhat is the difference between doing an independent study in, say one of the affiliated disciplines and a PNP Honors project?\nPNP Honors projects are two-semester, 6-unit undertakings that are expected to have a substantial interdisciplinary component.\nAn independent study in one of the affiliated discipline might be only 3 units and is likely to be more narrowly focused, which is why the capstone requirement includes the PNP Book Club.\nI think I want to do an Honors thesis in PNP. What should I do?\nFirst, check the detailed guidelines on the PNP <Honors webpage<link to Honors Page>. These explain what the Honors thesis involves and give a sample timeline, in addition to explaining the eligibility requirements for entry into the Honors program.\u00a0 The PNP Program receives a bound copy of all Honors Thesis and stores them for reference.\nWhat do I need to do for an Independent Work/Study to count towards my capstone requirement?\nPlease see the PNP Independent Study web page.\nI am taking part in a research project at the Medical School. Can I use this towards the capstone experience/depth requirement in the PNP major?\nIn principle, yes. This is straightforward if the project is one that falls under a Biology or Psychology 500 code. Approval from the PNP Administrator is required in order to apply a 500 level credit towards your PNP major. Regular requirements for an Independent Study apply.\nI am working on a research project in the Medical School. Can I receive credit for this?\nIt is in principle possible to receive credit under the PNP 500 course code. This is at the discretion of the PNP Administrator. PNP 500 is a code for independent research.\u00a0 Regular requirements for an Independent Study apply.\n"}, {"score": 1276.4009, "uuid": "3f43b884-5934-5967-a453-519b65701820", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1710wb-77-16195", "target_hostname": "global.ku.edu", "target_uri": "http://global.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/degree-requirements191", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Doctor of <em>Philosophy</em> <em>in</em> <em>Psychology</em>: Degree Requirements - KU Catalog", "snippet": "The quantitative minor is an addition to the regular program and does not replace any existing <em>or</em> future requirements of the student\u2019s <em>major</em> program.

Students also are expected to participate and assist with our regular summer training institutes on advanced quantitative techniques. Opportunities may include teaching undergraduate statistics in psychology, research assistantships in quantitative projects, assisting in research at an institute such as the Institute for Life Span Studies , or working in the Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis . Students have access to quantitative workshops and brown-bag lunches offered regularly by the quantitative training program. Workshops are conducted by national leaders in quantitative methods. Special resources for attending national workshops and conventions are also available.\nQuantitative Minor\nA minor in quantitative psychology is offered for graduate students in any of the department\u2019s major programs and for select programs in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (e.g., sociology). The quantitative minor is an addition to the regular program and does not replace any existing or future requirements of the student\u2019s major program. Students desiring a major emphasis in quantitative psychology should apply directly to the quantitative psychology program.\nThe minor consists of advanced course work in statistics, measurement, and methodology. The quantitative minor provides the student with elevated levels of quantitative expertise to enhance the overall quality of the research program. It gives students a competitive edge in the job market. Many faculty positions now request expertise in both a specific content area and in quantitative methods. Advanced quantitative skills also offer students additional job opportunities. The quantitative minor provides the additional credentials needed to pursue these jobs.\nThe minor requires 5 courses in quantitative methodology beyond the basic foundations course requirement ( PSYC 790 ). The classes normally are taken in the department but can come from other departments with approval. Currently available courses include Categorical Methods, Nonparametric Statistics, Multivariate Methods, Multilevel Modeling I, Structural Equation Modeling I and II, Test Theory, Factor Analysis, and regularly offered Advanced Topics in Quantitative Psychology seminars with varying topics.\nFor more information, contact Todd D. Little, yhat@ku.edu .\nDevelopmental Psychology\nAndrea Greenhoot and Patricia Hawley, Developmental Psychology Program Co-Directors\nTraining in developmental psychology is interdisciplinary and collaborative. The developmental emphasis profits significantly from affiliated faculty in other academic units such as Speech-Language-Hearing: Sciences and Disorders, the School of Education, and doctoral programs in Clinical Child Psychology, Child Language, Gerontology, and Neurosciences. The developmental emphasis is substantively linked to the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies, the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, and the Center for Biobehavioral Neurosciences in Communication Disorders. Many of the developmental psychology faculty have affiliations with more than one entity on campus. This breadth offers students multidisciplinary exposure and experiences that train them to conduct cutting-edge research on developmental phenomena across the life span. The program includes a number of concentrations, including cognitive, social, evolutionary, language, and quantitative. Students work with a faculty mentor to customize a concentration that suits the needs of the student and the expertise of the available faculty. The program is appropriate for students who wish to be trained in the traditional divisions of psychology (e.g., cognitive-developmental, social-developmental, quantitative-developmental) as well as those whose interests may not fall squarely within traditional divisions.\nCurriculum\nThe curriculum involves 35 hours of formal developmental courses in addition to master\u2019s, research skills and responsible scholarship, and dissertation research hours. Students are expected to enroll in a biweekly Proseminar on Developmental Science (6 semesters minimum). The program allows students to pursue their developmental research interests and accumulate academic credentials that give access to the job market of their choice.

The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable\"\nDr Jay E. Adams.\nWhat William Law wrote two centuries ago is even more evident today: \"Man needs to be saved from his own wisdom as much as from his own righteousness, for they produce one and the same corruption.\"\nIt is paradoxical that at a time when secular psychological researchers are demonstrating less confidence in psychological counseling, more and more professing Christians are pursuing it. \"Christian\" counseling centers are springing up all over the nation offering what many believe is the perfect combination: Christianity plus psychology. Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nWhen we suffer from 'the blues' it can just appear so natural and easy to simply follow the path which non-Christian friends and neighbors follow in seeking the psychological help offered by the theories of atheists and secularists...\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism. World-renowned research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \" All truth is God's truth .\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth , has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller 's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem) . In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. [See James Dobson report for this same teaching.] He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELLED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \" mid-life crisis ,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill !] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\nCopyright BDM.

Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism. World-renowned research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \" All truth is God's truth .\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth , has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller 's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem) . In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. [See James Dobson report for this same teaching.] He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \" mid-life crisis ,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill !] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\n* This material has been excerpted and/or adapted from a 6/89 Special Report by the same name from Media Spotlight, which is a condensation of the 1987 book, PsychoHeresy: The Psychological Seduction of Christianity by Martin & Deidre Bobgan, EastGate Publishers and PsychoHeresy Awareness Ministries , Santa Barbara, CA.\nBiblical Discernment Ministries - 11/95\n"}, {"score": 1260.4099, "uuid": "1d086262-cb99-5048-b63c-0b6011a90b42", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-65-21656", "target_hostname": "www.rapidnet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/psych.htm", "page_rank": 4.1099235e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Psychology</em> - Science <em>or</em> Religion?", "snippet": "The second <em>major</em> myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both <em>psychology</em> and the Bible.", "explanation": null, "document": "Psychology\nScience or Religion?*\nWhat William Law wrote two centuries ago is even more evident today: \"Man needs to be saved from his own wisdom as much as from his own righteousness, for they produce one and the same corruption.\"\nIt is paradoxical that at a time when secular psychological researchers are demonstrating less confidence in psychological counseling, more and more professing Christians are pursuing it. \"Christian\" counseling centers are springing up all over the nation offering what many believe is the perfect combination: Christianity plus psychology. Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism. World-renowned research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \" All truth is God's truth .\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth , has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller 's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem) . In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. [See James Dobson report for this same teaching.] He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \" mid-life crisis ,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill !] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\n* This material has been excerpted and/or adapted from a 6/89 Special Report by the same name from Media Spotlight, which is a condensation of the 1987 book, PsychoHeresy: The Psychological Seduction of Christianity by Martin & Deidre Bobgan, EastGate Publishers and PsychoHeresy Awareness Ministries , Santa Barbara, CA.\nBiblical Discernment Ministries - 11/95\n"}, {"score": 1259.6652, "uuid": "c510f87c-d8cf-524b-a1a0-609c57b6f1be", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200wb-80-15473", "target_hostname": "rapidnet.com", "target_uri": "http://rapidnet.com/%7Ejbeard/bdm/Psychology/psych.htm", "page_rank": 1.1724438e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Psychology</em> - Science <em>or</em> Religion?", "snippet": "The second <em>major</em> myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both <em>psychology</em> and the Bible.", "explanation": null, "document": "Psychology\nScience or Religion?*\nWhat William Law wrote two centuries ago is even more evident today: \"Man needs to be saved from his own wisdom as much as from his own righteousness, for they produce one and the same corruption.\"\nIt is paradoxical that at a time when secular psychological researchers are demonstrating less confidence in psychological counseling, more and more professing Christians are pursuing it. \"Christian\" counseling centers are springing up all over the nation offering what many believe is the perfect combination: Christianity plus psychology. Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism. World-renowned research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \" All truth is God's truth .\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth , has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller 's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem) . In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. [See James Dobson report for this same teaching.] He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \" mid-life crisis ,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill !] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\n* This material has been excerpted and/or adapted from a 6/89 Special Report by the same name from Media Spotlight, which is a condensation of the 1987 book, PsychoHeresy: The Psychological Seduction of Christianity by Martin & Deidre Bobgan, EastGate Publishers and PsychoHeresy Awareness Ministries , Santa Barbara, CA.\nBiblical Discernment Ministries - 11/95\n"}, {"score": 1258.7952, "uuid": "624a0fc7-40d9-5d97-a76f-63d6ed2fe3eb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1903wb-88-27045", "target_hostname": "www.marriagehealing.org", "target_uri": "http://www.marriagehealing.org/psychology-/psych2.htm", "page_rank": 1.369369e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>Psychology</em> - Science <em>or</em> Religion?", "snippet": "The second <em>major</em> myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both <em>psychology</em> and the Bible.", "explanation": null, "document": "Psychology\nScience or Religion?*\nWhat William Law wrote two centuries ago is even more evident today: \"Man needs to be saved from his own wisdom as much as from his own righteousness, for they produce one and the same corruption.\"\nIt is paradoxical that at a time when secular psychological researchers are demonstrating less confidence in psychological counseling, more and more professing Christians are pursuing it. \"Christian\" counseling centers are springing up all over the nation offering what many believe is the perfect combination: Christianity plus psychology. Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism. World-renowned research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \"All truth is God's truth.\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth, has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem). In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \"mid-life crisis,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill!] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\n* This material has been excerpted and/or adapted from a 6/89 Special Report by the same name from Media Spotlight, which is a condensation of the 1987 book, PsychoHeresy: The Psychological Seduction of Christianity by Martin & Deidre Bobgan, EastGate Publishers and PsychoHeresy Awareness Ministries, Santa Barbara, CA.\nCopyright BDM.

Potential transfer students have a number of factors to consider about our Undergraduate Program. Transfer students should also read the Transferring to Illinois State Web site .\nDefining Psychology\nPsychology is a scientific discipline with a focus on the behavior of individuals. Some psychologists have interests that overlap most closely with biology; they may study such topics as physiological psychology, neuroscience, perception, learning, memory, information processing, and psychopharmacology. Other psychologists have interests closer to those of social scientists. They study topics such as social development, social psychology, and personality.\nAs a profession, psychology applies scientific principles to specific problems. Examples of applied psychology are clinical or counseling psychology, industrial/organizational psychology, educational psychology, and school psychology. It is important for students who are interested in psychology as a profession to have a thorough understanding of the scientific principles they will apply. It is just as important for students interested in psychology as a science to understand applied problems.\nPsychology has a unique approach to understanding behavior and working with people (or animals) to facilitate behavioral changes. The approach is characterized by an empirical focus, in that, psychology values knowledge that is obtained through empirical, scientific studies. The Major in Psychology focuses on learning about the behavior of individuals and how to facilitate behavioral changes. Students also learn about the research process\u2014how psychology obtains empirical, scientific knowledge and how psychology applies this knowledge to solve problems.\nStudying Psychology\nStudents who take psychology courses in high school are exposed to only the general content of psychology. High school psychology courses should give students enough information to determine if they want to study psychology in depth in college. Students should also consider foreign language courses, because psychology is becoming very multicultural and international in its emphasis. The Major in Psychology at Illinois State builds upon skills in math, science, writing, critical thinking, and reasoning. Therefore, high school students are advised to take college preparatory courses in order to prepare for a variety of challenges that are available in higher education.\nStudents who study psychology in college learn about the entire discipline of psychology. Students study behavior and problem issues as well as the principles and procedures for conducting research. However, students also study more than just psychology; they are exposed to a variety of disciplines in general studies courses and develop skills and attitudes that reflect a broad education. In addition to studying other disciplines (math, english, biology, arts, etc.), students should also enroll in courses that will enhance their ability to evaluate knowledge (i.e., thinking in an analytic manner), to communicate verbally or in writing, and to understand how knowledge occurs in cultural contexts.\nHonors Students in Psychology\nThe Honors Program at Illinois State challenges and stimulates academically-talented and highly-motivated students, offering them the personal attention and collegiate atmosphere often found only at small, liberal arts colleges. Students can apply to the Honors Program when they apply for admission to Illinois State. See the Honors Scholarships Web site for scholarship information for incoming freshmen based on their high school academic achievements. The Honors Program also provides information about national and international awards for Honors students. Honors students can enroll in Honors sections of selected psychology classes. Click here for the Honors In Psychology Web site.\nPreparing for a Career\nPsychology is unlike some areas of study that prepare students for specific careers after they graduate with a bachelor's degree. For example, with a bachelor's degree in social work, graduates can seek employment as a social worker. With a bachelor's degree in education, graduates are eligible for employment as a teacher. However, students with a bachelor's degree in psychology cannot work as psychologists after graduation. Instead, graduates are prepared for two types of post-graduate opportunities:\n1. jobs that utilize the skills acquired as a psychology major. These skills include knowledge of psychological processes, research abilities, and liberal arts skills (e.g., writing, communicating, analyzing, etc.). These jobs are often in areas of social service, business, and education.\n2. or graduate study. Many jobs that utilize a knowledge of psychology require either a master's degree or a doctorate degree. These positions include counseling and psychotherapy, applications in school settings and business, college-level teaching, and advanced research positions.\nBecause the positions obtained by graduates vary, the Major in Psychology at Illinois State is designed to be applicable to students interested in a variety of careers at several educational levels (i.e., bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree). See the American Psychological Association's brochure \"Psychology Scientific Problems Solvers\u2014Careers for the 21st Century\". It is a useful resource that explains the field of psychology and potential careers.\n"}, {"score": 1253.3202, "uuid": "03f7ed90-de65-5fce-b53e-aebd44d19383", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-74-06837", "target_hostname": "www.rosemont.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.rosemont.edu/uc/majors/psychology/index.aspx", "page_rank": 1.466808e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Rosemont College: Undergraduate College \u00bb <em>Majors</em> \u00bb <em>Psychology</em>", "snippet": "Students completing a <em>major</em> <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em> will acquire knowledge of the research process <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em>, will learn to apply their acquired knowledge of <em>psychology</em> to real-life situations, will be ready to pursue graduate work <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em> <em>or</em> related fields, and will be ready to perform effectively <em>in</em>", "explanation": null, "document": "Five Psychology electives at or above the 200 level\n15 credits\nPSY-0100 Basic Concepts in Psychology\nAn introductory course designed to make students aware of the diversity of the field of psychology and the ways in which human behavior can be studied.

The primary cause of all environmental problems is human behavior. These problems are not really problems of the environment, but are the result of a mismatch between the ways in which human beings fulfill their needs and the natural processes that maintain ecological integrity. As experts on human behavior, psychologists have the potential to serve a crucial role in halting our ecologically-destructive trajectory and promoting a sustainable future. This course will examine the connections between human behavior and its impact on the environment. It will address the need to promote environmentally responsible behaviors by applying cognitive and social theories to behaviors such as energy conservation, recycling, and material consumption. No prerequisite. 3 credits. This course fulfills Sustainability requirement in the Undergraduate College\u2019s General Education program.\nPSY-H275 Psychology for Sustainability: Transformation of Self and World\nThe primary cause of all environmental problems is human behavior.

Students graduating in Fall, Spring or Summer of the academic year from the day or night school may be nominated by psychology faculty members for one of three awards. The award\u00a0 criteria are:\nAcademic Award - Presented to senior psychology majors who have shown exemplary effort and enthusiasm in meeting course requirements as demonstrated by classroom behavior, preparation of written and/or oral assignments, and exam grades. Minimum overall and major grade point averages of 3.0.\nResearch Award - Presented to senior psychology majors who have demonstrated clear understanding of the research process, from critically evaluating pertinent literature and designing of a workable study to the statistical analysis of data and preparation of professional quality reports. Although independent study research is not required, it must be evident that the students are capable of demonstrating a fair degree of rigor and independence in their research efforts.\nCommunity Service Award - Presented to senior psychology majors who have demonstrated concern for the college community over-and-above that required for the receipt of course credit or a salary. The services provided have been evaluated in some way as exemplary in the degree of leadership required, commitment shown, or their innovation.\nIf I think I might be qualified for one of these awards, can I ask a faculty member to nominate me?\nYes. The faculty have access to seniors' GPAs through the registrar's office. They are also usually well aware of students whose classroom and other accomplishments meet the criteria of the academic and research awards. However, most faculty are not aware of students' extracurricular activities on- or off-campus. For the community service award, it is very appropriate for students to inform their advisors, instructors, or the department chair of their interest in being nominated for the award. By mid-February, students should provide a faculty member with a list of their accomplishments, including such activities as serving as a Black & Gold leader, assisting with orientation programs, involvement in athletics, and so forth. Internship and volunteer activities qualify here as well.\nDoes receiving a departmental award really mean anything?\nIt can mean a lot. Few students are nominated and then selected for the 3 awards. Typically, 9 or fewer of the graduating psychology majors are presented with awards. If selected, it means you were well recognized by the faculty as outstanding among your peers. Receiving an award should be a clear message to you that you were appreciated as a student, researcher, or community participant. You should be proud of such an accomplishment. Lastly, for those who have supported you as you completed your degree, its a sign that the struggle, financial or emotional, was worthwhile.\nStudents nominated to receive an award should attend the brunch and ceremony provided by the College. They will receive letters of congratulations, with an invitation to the brunch. Bring family and friends along!\nAre there other awards I might be nominated for on campus?\nYes. Many clubs and associations on campus present awards to their most active and deserving members. Check with the Dean of Student Services for a list of possible awards. For scholarship information and applications visit the Financial Aid Office. Both offices are located in Dwight Hall.\nWhat about off-campus honors?\nIn 1997-98, The Massachusetts Public Education System of Higher Education Conference on Undergraduate Research, Scholarly, Creative, and Public Service Activities expanded its format to include all undergraduate scholars in the Commonwealth. Submissions are competitively evaluated at two levels; by faculty of the students\u2019 home-campus and by a multi-institution faculty panel. Students whose submissions receive final acceptance are then invited to present their work orally or in poster format in the Spring.\n"}, {"score": 1246.5449, "uuid": "6c728db2-0d6f-5738-9de8-d69062f43a09", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400tw-55-01697", "target_hostname": "tribalinsight.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://tribalinsight.wordpress.com/", "page_rank": 1.9773483e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "tribalinsight | social <em>psychology</em>, <em>philosophy</em>, consumerism and marketing", "snippet": "Global food giant Heinz has made a bit of a fuss about the growth of private-label <em>or</em> <em>in</em>-house brands <em>in</em> our <em>major</em> supermarkets.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted on 17/02/2012 by Paul Harrison\nA short chat with Julian Morrow on RN Drive about why we don\u2019t bother to change banks.

The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable\"\nDr Jay E. Adams.\nWhat William Law wrote two centuries ago is even more evident today: \"Man needs to be saved from his own wisdom as much as from his own righteousness, for they produce one and the same corruption.\"\nIt is paradoxical that at a time when secular psychological researchers are demonstrating less confidence in psychological counseling, more and more professing Christians are pursuing it. \"Christian\" counseling centers are springing up all over the nation offering what many believe is the perfect combination: Christianity plus psychology. Furthermore, Christians who are not even in the counseling ministry look to psychologists for advice on how to live, how to relate to others, and how to meet the challenges of life.\nIn their attempts to be relevant, many preachers, teachers, counselors, and writers promote a psychological perspective of life rather than a Biblical one. The symbol of psychology overshadows the cross of Christ, and psychological jargon contaminates the Word of God.\nPsychology is a subtle and widespread leaven in the Church. It has permeated the entire loaf and is stealthily starving the sheep. It promises far more than it can deliver and what it does deliver is not the food that nourishes. Yet multitudes of professing Christians view psychology with respect and awe.\nNow, when we speak of psychology as leaven we are not referring to the entire field of psychological study, such as valid research. Our concern is primarily with those areas that deal with the nature of man, how he should live, and how he can change. These involve some values, attitudes, and behavior that are diametrically opposed to God's Word. We will see, therefore, that psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have no compatibility with the Christian faith.\nFOUR MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY\nWhen we suffer from 'the blues' it can just appear so natural and easy to simply follow the path which non-Christian friends and neighbors follow in seeking the psychological help offered by the theories of atheists and secularists...\nAmong professing Christians, there are four major myths about psychology which have become entrenched in the Church:\nThe first major myth is common to Christians and non-Christians alike: that psychotherapy (psychological counseling along with its theories and techniques) is a science -- a means of understanding and helping humanity based on empirical evidence gleaned from measurable and consistent data.\nThe second major myth is that the best kind of counseling utilizes both psychology and the Bible. Psychologists who also claim to be Christians generally claim that they are more qualified to help people understand themselves and change their behavior than are other Christians (including pastors and elders) who are not trained in psychology.\nThe third major myth is that people who are experiencing mental-emotional behavioral problems are mentally ill. They are supposedly psychologically sick and, therefore, need psychological therapy. The common argument is that the doctor treats the body, the minister treats the spirit, and the psychologist treats the mind and emotions. Ministers, unless they are trained in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, are then supposedly unqualified to help people who are suffering from serious problems of living.\nThe fourth major myth is that psychotherapy has a high record of success -- that professional psychological counseling produces greater results than other forms of help, such as self-help or that provided by family, friends, or pastors. Thus, psychological counseling is seen as more effective than Biblical counseling in helping some Christians. This is one of the main reasons why so many professing Christians are training to become psychotherapists.\nIS PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE?\nMen and women of God seek wisdom and knowledge from both the revelation of Scripture and the physical world. Paul contends that everyone is accountable before God because of the evidence that creation gives of His existence (Rom. 1:20).\nScientific study is a valid way of coming to an understanding of God's work, and can be very useful in many walks of life.\nTrue science develops theories based on what is observed. It examines each theory with rigorous tests to see if it describes reality. The scientific method works well in observing and recording physical data and in reaching conclusions which either confirm or nullify a theory.\nDuring the mid-19th century, scholars (philosophers, really) desired to study human nature in the hope of applying the scientific method to observe, record, and treat human behavior. They believed that if people could be studied in a scientific manner, there would be greater accuracy in understanding present behavior, in predicting future behavior, and in altering behavior through scientific intervention.\nPsychology, and its active arm of psychotherapy, have indeed adopted the scientific posture. However, from a strictly scientific point of view, they have not been able to meet the requirements of true science.\nIn attempting to evaluate the status of psychology, the American Psychological Association appointed Sigmund Koch to plan and direct a study which was subsidized by the National Science Foundation. This study involved eighty eminent scholars in assessing the facts, theories, and methods of psychology. In 1983, the results were published in a seven-volume series entitled Psychology: A Study of Science. Koch describes the delusion in thinking of psychology as a science:\n\"The hope of a psychological science became indistinguishable from the fact of psychological science. The entire subsequent history of psychology can be seen as a ritualistic endeavor to emulate the forms of science in order to sustain the delusion that it already is a science.\"\nKoch also says, \"Throughout psychology's history as 'science,' the hard knowledge it has deposited has been uniformly negative.\"\nThe fact is that psychological statements which describe human behavior or which report results from research can be scientific. However, when we move from describing human behavior to explaining it, and particularly changing it, we move from science to opinion.\nTo move from description to prescription is to move from objectivity to opinion. And opinion about human behavior, when presented as truth or scientific fact, is mere pseudoscience. It rests upon false premises (opinions, guesses, subjective explanations) and leads to false conclusions.\nThe dictionary defines pseudoscience as \"a system of theories, assumptions, and methods erroneously regarded as scientific.\" Pseudoscience, or pseudoscientism, includes the use of the scientific label to protect and promote opinions which are neither provable nor refutable.\nOne aspect of psychology riddled with pseudoscience is that of psychotherapy. Had psychotherapy succeeded as a science, we would have some consensus in the field regarding mental-emotional-behavioral problems and how to treat them. Instead, the field is filled with contradictory theories and techniques, all of which communicate confusion rather than anything approximating scientific order.\nPsychotherapy proliferates with many conflicting explanations of man and his behavior. Psychologist Roger Mills, in his 1980 article, \"Psychology Goes Insane, Botches Role as Science,\" says:\n\"The field of psychology today is literally a mess. There are as many techniques, methods and theories around as there are researchers and therapists. I have personally seen therapists convince their clients that all of their problems come from their mothers, the stars, their bio-chemical make-up, their diet, their life-style and even the \"kharma\" from their past lives.\"\nWith over 250 separate systems of psychotherapy, each claiming superiority over the rest, it is hard to view such diverse opinions as scientific or even factual.\nThe actual foundations of psychotherapy are not science, but rather various philosophical world views, especially those of determinism, secular humanism, behaviorism, existentialism, and even evolutionism.

Fuller Torrey is very blunt when he says:\n\"The techniques used by Western psychiatrists are, with few exceptions, on exactly the same scientific plane as the techniques used by witch doctors.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY AS RELIGION\nExplanations of why people behave the way they do and how they change have concerned philosophers, theologians, cultists, and occultists throughout the centuries. These explanations form the basis of modern psychology. Yet psychology deals with the very same areas of concern already dealt with in Scripture.\nSince God's Word tells us how to live, all ideas about the why's of behavior and the how's of change must be viewed as religious in nature. Whereas the Bible claims divine revelation, psychotherapy claims scientific substantiation. Nevertheless, when it comes to behavior and attitudes, and morals and values, we are dealing with religion -- either the Christian faith or any one of a number of other religions, including secular humanism.\nNobelist Richard Feynman, in considering the claimed scientific status of psychotherapy, says that \"psychoanalysis is not a science\" and that it is \"perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"\nCarl Jung himself wrote:\n\"Religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. ... That is why patients force the psychotherapist into the role of a priest, and expect and demand of him that he shall free them from their distress. That is why we psychotherapists must occupy ourselves with problems which, strictly speaking, belong to the theologian.\"\nNote that Jung used the word \"religions\" rather than Christianity. Jung had repudiated Christianity and explored other forms of religious experience, including the occult. Without throwing out the religious nature of man, Jung dispensed with the God of the Bible and assumed the role of priest himself.\nJung viewed all religions, including Christianity, as collective mythologies. He did not believe they were real in essence, but that they could affect the human personality, and might serve as solutions to human problems.\nIn contrast to Jung, Sigmund Freud reduced all religious beliefs to the status of illusion and called religion \"the obsessional neurosis of humanity.\" He viewed religion as delusionary and, therefore, evil and the source of mental problems.\nBoth Jung's and Freud's positions are true in respect to the world's religions, but they are also anti-Christian. One denies Christianity and the other mythologizes it.\nRepudiating the God of the Bible, both Freud and Jung led their followers in the quest for alternative understandings of mankind and alternative solutions to problems of living. They turned inward to their own limited imaginations and viewed their subjects from their own anti-Christian subjectivity.\nThe faith once delivered to the saints was displaced by a substitute faith disguising itself as medicine or science, but based upon foundations which are in direct contradiction to the Bible.\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in his 1978 book The Myth of Psychotherapy, says, \"The basic ingredients of psychotherapy does not always involve repression.\" He points out that while psychotherapy does not always involve repression, it does always involve religion and rhetoric (conversation). Szasz says very strongly that \"the human relations we now call 'psychotherapy,' are, in fact, matters of religion -- and that we mislabel them as 'therapeutic' at great risk to our spiritual well-being.\" Elsewhere, in referring to psychotherapy as a religion, Szasz says:\n\"It is not merely a religion that pretends to be a science, it is actually a fake religion that seeks to destroy true religion.\"\nSzasz also says that \"psychotherapy is a modern, scientific-sounding name for what used to be called the 'cure of souls.'\" One of his primary purposes for writing The Myth of Psychotherapy was:\n\"... to show how, with the decline of religion and the growth of science in the eighteenth century, the cure of (sinful) souls, which had been an integral part of the Christian religions, was recast as the cure of (sick) minds, and became an integral part of medicine.\"\nThe cure of souls, which once was a vital ministry of the Church, has now in this century been displaced by a cure of minds called \"psychotherapy.\" True \"Biblical\" counseling has waned until presently it is almost nonexistent.\nTRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\nAlthough all forms of psychotherapy are religious, the fourth branch of psychology -- the transpersonal -- is more blatantly religious than the others. Transpersonal psychologies involve faith in the supernatural -- something beyond the physical universe. However, the spirituality they offer includes mystical experiences of both the occult and Eastern religions.\nThrough transpersonal psychotherapies, various forms of Eastern religion are creeping into Western life. Psychologist Daniel Goleman quotes Chogyam Trungpa as saying, \"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology.\" Goleman points out how Oriental religions \"seem to be making gradual headway as psychologies, not as religions.\" Also, Jacob Needleman says:\n\"A large and growing number of psychotherapists are now convinced that the Eastern religions offer an understanding of the mind far more complete than anything yet envisaged by Western science. At the same time, the leaders of the new religions themselves -- the numerous gurus and spiritual teachers now in the West -- are reformulating and adapting the traditional systems according to the language and atmosphere of modern psychology.\"\nPSYCHOLOGY PLUS THE BIBLE\nThe Church has not escaped the all-pervasive influence of psychotherapy. It has unwittingly and eagerly embraced the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy and has intimately incorporated this spectre into the very sinew of its life. Not only does the Church include the concepts and teachings of psychotherapists in sermons and seminaries, it steps aside and entrusts the mentally and emotionally halt and lame to the \"high altar\" of psychotherapy.\nMany Church leaders contend that the Church doesn't have the ability to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, and other problems of living. They, therefore, trust the paid practitioners of the pseudoscientisms of psychotherapy more than they trust the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.\nBecause of the confusion between science and pseudoscience, Church leaders have elevated the psychotherapist to a position of authority in the modern Church. Thus, any attack on the amalgamation of psychotherapy and Christianity is considered to be an attack on the Church itself.\nAlthough the Church has almost universally accepted and endorsed the psychological way, there are Christians who have not. Dr. Jay E. Adams says:\n\"In my opinion, advocating, allowing and practicing psychiatric and psychoanalytical dogmas within the church is every bit as pagan and heretical (and therefore perilous) as propagating the teachings of some of the most bizarre cults. The only vital difference is that the cults are less dangerous because their errors are more identifiable.\"\nPsychotherapy is a most subtle and devious spectre haunting the Church, because it is perceived and received as a scientific salve for the sick soul, rather than for what it truly is: a pseudoscientific substitute system of religious belief.\nThe early Church faced and ministered to mental-emotional-behavioral problems which were as complex as the ones that exist today. If anything, the conditions of the early Church were more difficult than those we currently face. The early Christians suffered persecution, poverty, and various afflictions which are foreign to most of the twentieth-century Christendom (especially in the West). The catacombs of Rome are a testimony to the extent of the problems faced by the early Church.\nIf we suffer at all, it is from affluence and ease, which have propelled us toward a greater fixation on self that would likely have occurred in less affluent times. However, the cure for sins of self-preoccupation existed in the early Church and is just as available today. In fact, Biblical cures used by the early Church are just as potent if used today.\nThe Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit are applicable to all problems of living and do not need to be superceded by talk therapies and talk therapists.\nHas the modern Church given up its call and obligation to minister to suffering individuals? If so, it is because Christians believe the myth that psychological counseling is science when, in fact, it is another religion and another gospel.\nThe conflict between the psychological way of counseling and the Biblical way is not between true science and religion. The conflict is strictly religious -- it's a conflict between many religions grouped under the name of psychotherapy (psychological counseling) and the one true religion of the Bible.\nThe worst of the primrose promises of Christian psychology is that the Bible plus psychotherapy can provide better help than just the Bible alone. While this idea has been promulgated and promoted by many \"Christian\" psychotherapists, there is no research evidence to support it. No one has ever shown that the Bible needs psychological augmentation to be more effective in dealing with life's problems.\nNo one has proven that a Christianized cure of minds (psychotherapy) is any more beneficial than the original unadulterated simple cure of souls (Biblical counseling).\nIS THERE A CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY?\nThe Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) is a group of psychologists and psychological counselors who are professing Christians. At one of their meetings the following was stated:\n\"We are often asked if we are \"Christian Psychologists\" and find it difficult to answer since we don't know what the question implies. We are Christians who are psychologists but at the present time there is no acceptable Christian psychology that is markedly different from non-Christian psychology. It is difficult to imply that we function in a manner that is fundamentally distinct from our non-Christian colleagues ... as yet there is not an acceptable theory, mode of research or treatment methodology that is distinctly Christian\" (6/76 CAPS Western Assoc. meeting).\nIn spite of the hodge-podge of unscientific opinions and contradictions, \"Christian psychologists\" proclaim, \" All truth is God's truth .\" They use this statement to support their use of psychology, but they are not clear about what \"God's truth is.\" Is God's truth Freudian pronouncements of obsessive neurosis? Or is it Jung's structure of archetypes? Or is God's truth the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner? Or is God's truth \"I'm OK; You're OK\"?\nPsychology, like all religions, includes elements of truth. Even Satan's temptation of Eve included both truth and lie. The enticement of the \"All truth is God's truth\" fallacy is that there is some similarity between Biblical teachings and psychological ideas. However, similarities do not make psychology compatible with Christianity any more than the similarities between Christianity and other religious systems of belief. Even the writings of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Moslem religions contain statements about attitudes and behavior which may be similar to some Bible verses.\nThe similarities between psychology and Christianity merely indicate that the systems of psychological counseling are indeed religious. Christians should no more turn to psychologists than to leaders of non-Christian religions to find wisdom and help with problems of living.\nSince there exists no standardized \"Christian\" psychology, each so-called Christian psychologist decides for himself which of the many psychological opinions and methods constitute his ideas of \"God's truth.\" In so doing, the subjective observations and biased opinions of mere mortals are placed on the same level as the inspired Word of God.\nThe Bible contains the only pure truth of God. All else is distorted by the limitations of human perception. Whatever else one can discover about God's creation is only partial knowledge and partial understanding. It cannot in any way be equal to God's truth.\nTo even hint that the often conflicting theories of such unredeemed men as Freud, Jung, Rogers, etc. are God's truth is to undermine the very Word of God. The revealed Word of God does not need the support or help of psychological pronouncements. The Word alone stands as the truth of God. That psychologists who call themselves Christian would even use such a phrase to justify their use of psychology, indicates the direction of their faith.\nThe statement \"All truth is God's truth\" is discussed in the popular \"Christian\" publication, Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology. The book claims that its contributors are \"among the finest evangelical scholars in the field.\" In his review of this book, Dr. Ed Payne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Medical College of Georgia, says, \"Almost certainly the message of the book and its authors is that the Bible and psychological literature stand on the same authoritative level.\"\nPayne also states:\n\"Many pastors and laymen may be deceived by the Christian label of this book. Such psychology presented by Christians is a plague on the modern church, distorting the Christian's relationship with God, retarding his sanctification, and severely weakening the church. No other area of knowledge seems to have a stranglehold on the church. This book strengthens that hold both individually and corporately.\"\nBaker Encyclopedia of Psychology merely reflects what the Church has come to accept: Unscientific, unsubstantiated, unproven psychological opinions of men have now been leavened into the Church through the semantic sorcery of \"All truth is God's truth.\" The equating of psychology and theology reveals that the leaven has now come to full loaf.\nTHE GOSPEL OF SELF\nOne of the most popular themes in psychology is that of self-fulfillment. Although this is an extremely popular theme, it is a theme of recent origin, having arisen only within the past forty years [late-1940s] outside of the Church an in the past twenty years with the Church itself.\nAs society moved from self-denial to self-fulfillment, a new vocabulary emerged which revealed a new inner attitude and a different view of life. The new vocabulary became the very fabric of a new psychology known as humanistic psychology. Its major focus is self-actualization and its clarion call is self-fulfillment. And self-fulfillment, with all its accompanying self-hyphenated and self-fixated variations such as self-love, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-worth , has become the new promised land. Then as the Church became psychologized, the emphasis shifted from God to self.\n\"Christian\" books began to reflect what was accepted in society. Some examples are Love Yourself; The Art of Learning to Celebrate Yourself; Loving Yourselves; Celebrate Yourself; You're Someone Special; Self-Esteem: You're Better than You Think; and probably best known, Robert Schuller 's Self Esteem: The New Reformation. Books and examples of a psychological self-stroking mentality are numerous.\nAccording to the psychologizers of Christianity, the greatest detriment to a fulfilling life is low self-esteem. In their quest to bring their followers to the realization of their full potential (self-actualization), they substitute one form of self-centeredness (high self-esteem) for another form of self-centeredness (low self-esteem) . In either case, self is the focal point of the cure as well as the problem.\nLow self-esteem is popular because it's much more palatable to accept the idea of having \"low self-esteem\" than to confess evil, ungodly, self-centered thoughts and then repent through believing what God has said in His Word. While low self-esteem calls for psychological treatment to raise self-esteem, sinful thinking calls for confession, repentance, restoration, and walking by faith in a love relationship with God provided by the cross of Christ. We would suggest that one look to Scripture to discover one's greatest need and to find an antidote to life's problems, rather than attempt to scripturalize some psychological fad. Mankind's greatest need is for Jesus Christ, not self-esteem.\nUnless Scripture is molded to conform to the teachings that promote self, the Bible clearly teaches one to be Christ-centered and other-oriented. Loving God above all else and with one's entire being, and loving neighbor as much as one ALREADY loves oneself, are the primary injunctions of the Bible. The admonition to love oneself or to esteem oneself is missing.\nRather than self-love being taught as a virtue in Scripture, it is placed among the diabolical works of the flesh. For example, Paul addresses the issue of self-love from just the opposite perspective of present-day promoters both inside and outside the Church (2 Tim. 3:1-5).\nThe teachings of self-love, self-esteem, and self-worth have been gleaned from the world rather than from Scripture. They are products of humanistic psychologists rather than the truth of God's Word.\nNumerous are the examples of \"Christian\" psychologists who are ordained ministers. They begin with a desire to Christianize psychology and end up psychologizing Christianity. Dr. Richard Dobbins, founder and director of Emerge Ministries, is one example of the many ministers who have turned to psychology.\nIn his teaching film The Believer and His Self Concept, Dobbins leads the viewers through a series of steps to end up chanting, \"I am a lovable person. I am a valuable person. I am a forgivable person.\" In Dobbins' exercise is found the confusion between the Biblical fact that God loves, values, and forgives His children and the humanistic psychological lie that we are intrinsically lovable, valuable, and forgivable. If we have one iota of loveliness, or one iota of value, or one iota of forgivability, then it makes no sense that Christ should have to die for us.\nGod has chosen to set his love upon us because of His essence, not because of ours, even after we are believers. His love, His choice to place value upon us, and His choice to forgive us are by His grace alone. It is fully undeserved. It is not because of who we are by some intrinsic value of our own or by our own righteousness.\nThe paradoxical, profound, and powerful truth of Scripture is that though we are not intrinsically lovable, valuable, or forgivable, God loves, values, and forgives us. That is the pure theology of Scripture and the overpowering message of Christ's death and resurrection. The Biblical truth is better presented as: \"I am not a lovable person. I am not a valuable person. I am not a forgivable person. But Christ died for me!\"\nThe alternative to self-love is not self-hate, but rather love in relationship with God and others. The alternative to self-esteem is not self-denigration, but rather an understanding of the greatness of God dwelling in a weak vessel of flesh. The alternative to self-fulfillment is not a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. It is God's invitation to be so completely involved with His will and His purposes that fulfillment comes through relationship with Him rather than with self.\nThe realization that the God and Creator of the universe has chosen to set His love upon us, should engender love and esteem for Him rather than for self. The amazing truth that He has called us into relationship with Him to do His will far surpass the puny dreams of self-fulfillment.\nThe psychologizers in the Church are not providing spiritual sustenance to those they try to make comfortable in their self-centeredness. They are robbing them of the riches of Christ offered to all who will humble themselves before Him.\nHumility is not in the language of psychology to any great degree. Dobbins even goes so far as to encourage individuals to express anger at God. [See James Dobson report for this same teaching.] He says, \"If you're angry with God, tell Him you're angry with Him. Go ahead and tell Him. He's big enough to take it.\" Where in Scripture do we have an example that it's okay to be angry with God? Jonah was angry to his own detriment, but no example can be found where anger at God is condoned, let alone encouraged (cf. Eccl. 5:2).\nWhenever psychology is intermingled with Scripture, it dilutes the Word and deludes the Church. Anger is more complex than the dangerous simplicity that Dobbins portrays. His Biblical basis for expressing anger is weak at best and misleading at least. Dobbins' writings and films are based upon his own personal, unproven psychological opinions. Unfortunately, his opinions and conclusions do not square with reality. Apparently, Dobbins would like us to believe what he says because he says so. However, to subscribe to the defunct hydraulic-ventilationist theory and to prescribe tackling dummies, pounding mattresses, punching a bag, etc. (as he does in his writings), and to recommend getting angry with God without valid research or Biblical proof is scientifically inexcusable and Biblically unreliable.\nTHE ROAD MORE TRAVELLED\nPsychiatrist M. Scott Peck has become an extremely popular speaker and writer among professing Christians. His books People of the Lie and The Road Less Traveled have appeared on a leading evangelical magazine's Book of the Year list. The list is a result of votes cast by a group of evangelical writers, leaders, and theologians selected by the magazine. A New York Times book reviewer reveals, \"The book's main audience is in the vast Bible Belt.\" The reviewer describes The Road Less Traveled as \"an ambitious attempt to wed Christian theology to the 20th-century discoveries of Freud and Jung.\"\nIn an interview which appeared in Christianity Today, Peck was asked \"what he meant when he called Christ 'Savior.'\" The reviewer writes,\n\"Peck likes Jesus the Savior as fairy godmother (a term I'm sure he does not use flippantly) and an exemplar, or one who shows us how to live and die. But he does not like the idea of Jesus the Atoner\" (3/1/85, Christianity Today, p. 22).\nPeck's understanding of the nature of God and the nature of man comes from a blend of Jungian psychology and Eastern mysticism rather than from the Bible. He says of God and man:\n\"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination. This is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end\" (cf. Isa. 44:6).\nPeck continues:\n\"It is one thing to believe in a nice old God who will take good care of us from a lofty position of power which we ourselves could never begin to attain. It is quite another to believe in a God who has it in mind for us precisely that we should attain His position, His power, His wisdom, His identity.\"\nThe only words that approach this description are those of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13-14. And indeed, Peck claims godhood for those who will take the responsibility for attaining it:\n\"Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it is possible for man to become God, we can really never rest for long, never say, 'OK, my job is finished, my work is done.' We must constantly push ourselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater effectiveness. By this belief we will have trapped ourselves, at least until death, on an effortful treadmill of self-improvement and spiritual growth. God's responsibility must be our own.\"\nPeck goes further into the morass of Eastern mysticism and Jungian occultism when he says, \"To put it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all the time. God has been with us all along, is now, and always will be.\"\nIn contrast to Peck, the Bible reveals that the only way a person comes into relationship with God is through faith in Jesus Christ as the only Way to the Father. Until a person is born of the Spirit, he resides in the kingdom of darkness and is under the dominion of Satan (Eph. 2:1-5).\nNo matter how personable and well-meaning \"Christian\" therapists (or therapists who claim to be Christian) may be, they are heavily influenced by the ungodly psychological perspective. Psychology thus becomes the means for both interpreting Scripture and applying it to daily living. When one reads the Bible from the psychological perspective of Freud, Jung, Adler, Maslow, Rogers, et al., he tends to conform his understanding of the Bible to their theories. Rather than looking at life through the lens of the Bible, he looks at the Bible through the lens of psychology.\nAmalgamators add the wisdom of men to fill in what they think is missing from the Bible. They take the age-old sin problem rooted in self-centeredness, give it a new name, such as \" mid-life crisis ,\" or some other idea, and offer solutions from the leavened loaf. They integrate psychological ideas with a Bible verse or story here and there to come up with what they believe to be effective solutions to problems they mistakenly think are beyond the reach of Scripture.\nPASTORS UNDERMINED\nPsychological counselors undermine pastors and have developed a formula for referral: (1) Anyone who is not psychologically trained is not qualified to counsel those people with the really serious problems of living; and (2) Refer them to professional trained therapists. This is one predictable and pathetic pattern of the psychological seduction of Christianity.\nPastors have been intimidated by the warnings from psychologists. They have become fearful of doing the very thing God has called them to do: to minister to the spiritual needs of the people through godly counsel both in and out of the pulpit. Some of that intimidation has come from pastors trained in psychology.\nA spokesman for the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, a psychotherapeutically trained group of pastors, says, \"Our concern is that there are a lot of ministers who aren't trained to handle their parishioners' psychotherapy.\" And of course, if the pastors are not trained, they are not considered qualified. Therefore, the predictable benediction to the litany is: \"refer to a professional.\"\nWithin the confines of the psychotherapists' office, the pastoral message confronting sin in the individual's life is subverted. There has been a subtle change in the meanings of words and phrases. The word sin has been substituted with less convicting words such as shortcoming, mistake, reaction to past hurt. Words such as healed and whole replace sanctified and holy. In fact, the word holy has been redefined to mean some kind of psychological wholeness. For the psychologizers, what is literal in Scripture often becomes metaphorical, and what is metaphorical becomes literal.\nBut these redefinitions are not received only by those who pay the price to receive them from psychotherapists; they have become standardized within the professing Christian community at large through the influence of psychotherapy in books, magazines, and in the so-called Christian media.\nIs it any wonder that the few godly pastors that are left today are at their wit's end in attempting to counsel from Scripture those under their care?\nUltimately, those who trust in psychotherapy rather than in Scripture will suffer because they are not brought face-to-face with their sin nature. What psychological system justifies a person before God and gives him peace with God? What psychological system gives the kind of faith in which a person can live by all of God's promises? What psychological system fulfills its promises the way God fulfills His? What psychological system gives the hope of which Paul speaks? What psychological system enables a person to exult in the midst of tribulation? What psychological system increases the kind of perseverance that builds proven character, gives hope, and produces divine love -- love that extends even to one's enemies?\nThroughout the centuries, there have been individuals who have suffered from extremely difficult problems of living who have sought God, and they have found Him to be true and faithful. They looked into the Word of God for wisdom and guidance for living with and overcoming the problems of life. The lives of those saints far outshine the lives of such pitiful souls as those who have followed the siren song of psychotherapy.\nTHE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS\nThe terms mental disease, mental illness, and mental disorder are popular catch-alls for all kinds of problems of living, most of which have little or nothing to do with disease. As soon as a person's behavior is labeled \"illness,\" treatment and therapy become the solutions. If, on the other hand, we consider a person to be responsible for his behavior, we should deal with him in the areas of education, faith, and choice. If we label him \"mentally ill,\" we rob him of the human dignity of personal responsibility and the divine relationship by which problems may be met.\nBecause the term mental illness throws attitudes and behavior into the medical realm, it is important to examine its accuracy. In discussing the concept of mental illness or mental disease, research psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey says:\n\"The term itself is nonsensical, a semantic mistake. The two words cannot go together ... you can no more have a mental 'disease' than you can have a purple idea or a wise space.\"\nThe word mental means \"mind\" and the mind is not the same as the brain. Also, the mind is really more than just a function or activity of the brain. Brain researcher and author Barbara Brown insists that the mind goes beyond the brain. She says:\n\"The scientific consensus that mind is only mechanical brain is dead wrong ... the research data of the sciences themselves point much more strongly toward the existence of a mind-more-than-brain than they do toward the mere mechanical brain action.\"\nGod created the human mind to know Him and to choose to love, trust, and obey Him. In the very creative act, God planned for mankind to rule His earthly creation and to serve as His representatives on earth. Because the mind goes beyond the physical realm, it goes beyond the reaches of science and cannot be medically sick.\nSince the mind is not a physical organ, it cannot have a disease. While one can have a diseased brain, once cannot have a diseased mind, although he may have a sinful or unredeemed mind. Torrey aptly says:\n\"The mind cannot really become diseased any more than the intellect can become abscessed. Furthermore, the idea that mental 'diseases' are actually brain diseases creates a strange category of 'diseases' which are, by definition, without known cause. Body and behavior become intertwined in this confusion until they are no longer distinguishable. It is necessary to return to first principles: a disease is something you have, behavior is something you do.\"\nOne can understand what a diseased body is, but what is a diseased mind? It is obvious that one cannot have a diseased emotion or a diseased behavior. Then why a diseased mind? Nevertheless, therapists continually refer to mental-emotional-behavioral problems as diseases.\nThomas Szasz criticizes what he calls the \"psychiatric impostor\" who \"supports a common, culturally shared desire to equate and confuse brain and mind, nerves and nervousness.\" Not only are brain and mind not synonymous, neither are nerves and nervousness. One might nervously await the arrival of a friend who is late for an appointment, but the nerves are busy performing other tasks. Szasz further says:\n\"It is customary to define psychiatry as a medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. This is a worthless and misleading definition. Mental illness is a myth ... the notion of a person 'having a mental illness' is scientifically crippling. It provides professional assent to the popular rationalization -- namely, that problems in living experienced and expressed in terms of so-called psychiatric symptoms are basically similar to bodily diseases.\"\nAlthough a medical problem or brain disease may bring on mental-emotional-behavioral symptoms, the person does not and cannot rationally be classified as \"mentally ill.\" He is medically ill, not mentally ill. The words psychological and biological are not synonymous. In the same way, mental and medical are not synonymous. One refers to the mind, the other to the body.\nPsychological counseling does not deal with the physical brain. It deals with aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therefore, the psychotherapist is not in the business of healing diseases, but of teaching new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. He is a teacher, not a doctor.\nMany have dishonestly used the term mental illness to describe a whole host of problems of thinking and behaving which should be labeled as \"problems of living.\" Though the term mental illness is a misnomer and a mismatch of words, it has become firmly ingrained in the public vocabulary and is glibly pronounced on all sorts of occasions by both lay and professional persons. Jonas Robitscher says:\n\"Our culture is permeated with psychiatric thought. Psychiatry, which had its beginnings in the care of the sick , has expanded its net to include everyone, and it exercises its authority over this total population by methods that range from enforced therapy and coerced control to the advancement of ideas and the promulgation of values.\"\nThe very term mental illness has become a blight on society. If we really believe that a person with a mental-emotional-behavioral problem is sick, then we have admitted that he is no longer responsible for his behavior. And if he is not responsible for his behavior, who is?\nThe psychoanalytic and behavioristic approaches preach that man's behavior is fixed by forces outside of his control. In the psychoanalytic approach, man is controlled by inner psychic forces. If man's behavior is determined by internal or external uncontrollable forces, it follows that he is not responsible for his behavior. Thus, criminals are allowed to plea bargain on the basis of \"temporary insanity,\" \"diminished capacity,\" and \"incompetent to stand trial.\" The full impact of the evil unleashed upon society by the psychoanalytical professionals is yet to be realized.\nMeanwhile, the mystique surrounding the term mental illness has frightened away people who could be of great help to those suffering from problems of living. Many people who want to help individuals with problems of living feel \"unqualified\" to help a person labeled \"mentally ill.\" The confusion inherent within this strange juxtaposition of terms has led to errors which have often been more harmful than helpful to those thus labeled.\nCase histories abound of governmental intrusion into personal lives, forced incarceration in mental institutions, deprivation of personal rights, and loss of livelihoods because of the stigma attached to the term \"mental illness.\" Nevertheless, the profession continues to promote the false concept of mental illness, to align it with medicine, and consign it to science -- and the public follows. [Even infants are now being diagnosed as mentally ill !] Worse yet, the professing Church follows.\nIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL?\nBecause of the great faith in what is believed to be science and the ever expanding numbers of people labeled \"mentally ill,\" psychotherapy continues to flourish with promises for change, cure, and happiness. Assurances are undergirded by testimonies and confidence in psychological models and methods. Yet research tells us something different about the effectiveness and the limitations of psychotherapy.\nThe best-known earthly research on the success and failure rates of psychotherapy was reported in 1952 by Hans J. Eysenck, an eminent English scholar. Eysenck compared groups of patients treated by psychotherapy with persons given little or no treatment at all. He found that a greater percentage of patients who did not undergo psychotherapy demonstrated greater improvement over those who did undergo therapy. After examining over 8,000 cases, Eysenck concluded that:\n\"... roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association indicates that a definite answer to the question, \"Is psychotherapy effective?\" may be unattainable. Their 1982 research book, Psychotherapy Research: Methodological and Efficacy Issues, concludes: \"Unequivocal conclusions about casual connections between treatment and outcome may never be possible in psychotherapy research.\" In its review of this book, the Brain/Mind Bulletin says, \"Research often fails to demonstrate an unequivocal advantage from psychotherapy.\" The following is an interesting example from the book:\n..\". an experiment at the All-India Institute of Mental Health in Bangalore found that Western-trained psychiatrists and native healers had a comparable recovery rate. The most notable difference was that the so-called 'witch doctors' released their patients sooner.\"\nIf the American Psychopathological Association and the American Psychiatric Association (as well as other independent study groups) give mixed reports about the efficacy of psychotherapy, why do so many \"Christian\" leaders promote the untenable promises of psychology? And if there is so little sound research, and virtually no empirical evidence to support psychotherapy, why are professing Christians eager to substitute theories and therapists for Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit? These are legitimate questions, especially in view of the obvious religious nature of psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Church exists in a hostile world. If its members do not reject the philosophies of the world they will reflect them in their lives. If we are friends with the world (its religions, philosophies, psychological systems and practices) then we must seriously ask ourselves why we do not heed Jesus' words:\nIf the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you (Jn. 15:18-19).\nObviously, if we do not heed His words, it's because we don't believe His words. The Church has been called to reflect Jesus, not the world. Even though we are in the world we are not of the world. Thus, every ministry of the Body of Christ must be Biblical and must not attempt to incorporate worldly philosophies, theories, or techniques.\nJesus is \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" not Freud, Jung, Adler, Rogers, Maslow, Ellis, or any other man. A church that does not seek the Lord as its source but relies on the philosophical and psychological ideas and techniques of men will become as secular as the world. Such a church may indeed have a form of godliness but it has denied the power of God. It has established man as its god.\nAs the Body of Christ we need to pray for cleansing. We need to pray for pruning. We need to seek His face with diligence. We need to put off the old (all that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil), and put on the new (all that is in Jesus Christ).\nLet us therefore drink from the springs of living water that flow from Jesus rather than the broken cisterns of psychological systems.\nCopyright BDM.

The process is largely based on availability as students graduate or otherwise leave the psychology department.\nIs it possible to request a specific advisor?\nMaybe. If a specific advisor is wanted, the student should meet with the chair and discuss why. Should the desired advisor have an opening, it may be possible for a change of advisor. However, given the number of psychology majors, most advisors have very full loads. Advisors may not make switches themselves.\nAs an evening student, do I have an advisor?\nYes. You may get general information about the programs and course offerings of Graduate and Continuing Education by calling (508) 626 - 4550. To speak to a general advisor or to schedule an appointment during advising periods with an academic advisor, ask for Bill Irwin. If you need specific advising about the psychology major, the assigned advisor is Dr. Ludemann. Contact her at (508) 626 - 4868 or pludemann@framingham.edu\nRecommended Course Sequences\nIs there a \"best\" sequence for completing the psychology courses?\nThere are many routes to completing your degree requirements. Some suggestions are:\n100- & 200-level courses should be taken before 300- & 400-level courses. Many upper-level courses have prerequisites, are reserved for juniors/seniors, and have few seats (25 rather than 35). These features make upper-level courses difficult to get into until the end of your college years.\nDuring the first 2 years, students should complete General Psychology, the non-psychology requirements, and a few 200-level psychology courses in preparation for the Core Psychology courses.\nNo later than the first semester junior year, students should complete the statistics requirement.\nNo later than the second semester junior year, students should enroll in the first of the 3 required research courses (Research Methods I).\nDuring the senior year, majors should plan to enroll in the Senior Thesis course.\nSocial psychology is particularly valuable in helping students think of research ideas appropriate for their thesis projects.\nSave some \"easy\" General Education courses for semesters in which Research Methods I & II will be taken. These are very demanding psychology courses.\nIt is strongly recommended that students complete their lab science course(s) before enrolling in the research courses. The time needed for meeting the lab requirements and the demands of the research courses are often difficult to manage together.\nMay I take several of the Core Psychology courses in the same semester?\nNo. Most of the Core courses have prerequisites. General Psychology must be completed before any of the other Core courses may be taken. Research Methods I is the prerequisite for Research Methods II. Research Methods II is the prerequisite for Senior Thesis. Thus, the 3 research courses must be taken sequentially and it will take all students 3 semesters to do so.\nTransferring Courses\nMay I complete some of my requirements at other colleges during summers and transfer the credits to FSU?\nYes, you may transfer up to three-quarters of your course credits and still graduate with a degree from FSU.\u00a0 However, Core courses may not be transferred for credit towards the psychology major once enrolled at FSU.\u00a0 Students who enroll at FSU for the first time as transfer students are sometimes able to meet a minimal number of Core classes in this way.\u00a0 Typically, only credit for General Psychology is granted in transfer-student situations and, in rare situations, Research Methods I.\u00a0 The department Chair makes all such determinations.\nSome courses that are 300-level at FSU and fulfill concentration requirements may not transfer as 300-level.\u00a0 In such cases, the transfer course, despite its title, will not satisfy the requirements of the major.\nBe sure to complete all of the registrar transfer approval forms BEFORE registering and paying for a non-FSU course!\u00a0 Taking a course without doing so may result in nontransference of the credits.\nStudents must earn a C or better in any course before tranfer credit will be granted at FSU.\nMay I fulfill some of my requirements through FSU's evening, Summer or Intersession programs?\nYes and many students do to catch-up or get ahead.\u00a0 DGCE courses, however, generally do not count as part of the full-time day load of courses.\u00a0 If enrolled at FSU as a full-time day student, enrollment in a DGCE course must be paid for separately - in addition to the day school tuition and fees.\u00a0 When these courses are completed, grades will appear on your transcript just like the day school courses; there is no need to do any course transfer requests.\nYear by year, many of the courses offered summers and evenings are online or hybrid.\u00a0 Additionally, most traditional evening courses meet just once per week for 3 hours. These teaching differences may be convenient when students are not living on campus or have other life factors which interfere with being in a traditional classroom-based course 2 to 4 times a week.\nCourse Overloads\nMay I take extra courses through the evening school while I am a full-time day school student?\nUnder certain circumstances it is possible to take a course overload. Only students with GPA's of 3.0 and who obtain approval from their advisors and the department chair are permitted to enroll in a 5th course during any semester. This includes courses taken from the day school, evening school, or on other college or university campuses.\nIf I meet those requirements, it is recommended?\nTypically no. Carrying 5 courses in a semester is very difficult. Anyone planning to do so should be selecting courses that are relatively nondemanding. Taking a fifth course is not a good way to raise a GPA or maintain an already good one. Students taking too many courses often do poorly in all of them. The end result may be the lowering of a student's overall GPA.\n"}, {"score": 1207.1547, "uuid": "1c36c43c-5370-5070-b070-ac7f01892055", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-44-08563", "target_hostname": "www.framingham.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.framingham.edu/psychology-and-philosophy/career-planning/index.html", "page_rank": 1.3378135e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Framingham State University - <em>Psychology</em> and <em>Philosophy</em> - Career Planning", "snippet": "Students are likely to refer to this every semester, as well as after graduation <em>should</em> they have a writing assignment.

Until it's upon them, many students don't realize how stressful finishing college can be. Completing that 32nd course means more than an end to tests, papers, professors, and so forth. For most graduates, it also means the beginning of many other more serious responsibilities - employment applications and interviews, full-time jobs, reduced or no more reliance on mom and dad, college bills to repay, less time to \"play\" with friends, and so forth. Waiting to plan for these events can make the last semester all the more stressful. Although some aspects can't be dealt with early, a few can. Preparing may help reduce anxieties and, hopefully, enable students to secure the jobs they want.\nWhat should I keep as I go through college and after?\nFor the most part, once you complete a course, you probably won't need the textbook again. Texts become out-dated very quickly. If it's worth it to you, sell the book to another student or back to the bookstore. Unfortunately, used textbooks, no matter what the condition, don't command high returns.\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule, however. Psychology majors may want to hold onto texts they feel are in an area of study they enjoy and may pursue later. A familiar text to refer to can speed the finding of information later on. Your APA writing manual is a keeper. Students are likely to refer to this every semester, as well as after graduation should they have a writing assignment. Lastly, your general psychology text provides a good overview of many issues in psychology. Reviewing this text is step one of preparing for the psychology subject test of the GRE's.\nDo I need to keep any course materials?\nYes. There are a few important things to keep. It is recommended that on a semesterly basis, students file away important papers in a notebook or storage box. Many of your professors still have a box or two of old course materials from their own school days. Course materials to consider keeping:\nCollege Catalog: Students must meet the college and major requirements specified in the catalog of the year in which they enrolled. It is the students' responsibility to know these requirements and to inform their advisors should misinformation be provided due to college or departmental changes. Additionally, should a student opt to transfer to another institution, the personnel of that new college may ask to see the catalog or parts of it.\nCourse Syllabi: Course descriptions within college catalogs are deliberately brief and vague. The description allows students to get an idea of what the course will entail as far as content, but without specifics. The instructor then has a fair amount of liberty in structuring the course specifics.\nTransferring: When transferring, it is not unusual for copies of syllabi to be requested. Only by looking at the actual syllabi can registrars or department chairs determine if new students have met prerequisites and such. Most faculty members do not store old syllabi - hardcopy or on computer. Do not expect to be able to request one years or even semesters after completing a course.\nPapers: Though most student papers can be tossed, wise students will hold onto a few that received high grades or are particularly good examples of their writing ability. Sometimes when applying for jobs and often in completing graduate school applications, a writing sample is requested. Providing a paper previously read and edited by an instructor is a better hedge toward success than a spur-of-the-moment paper! In fact, it is strongly recommended that majors revise their experimental papers after the semester. Though this revision will not be graded, someday you may be very happy you took the extra time. This is often a paper worked on for two semesters and that has been revised 6-8 times. Set a post-experimental date by which the final revisions will be made and no excuses for not getting it done!!! If students feel their experimental instructors may not give full attention to a paper that will never be touched again by the student, they should let the instructor know in advance of their intent to revise. Ask for a thorough critique, even if it might mean tougher grading as every flaw is noted!\nNotes: If students have taken courses that may relate to their future employment positions, lecture notes and class activity sheets may come in handy. As an employee, you may be asked to take the lead in a staff meeting. As a graduate student, it is likely that you will be offered a teaching assistantship. As a TA, you will be presenting lectures or conducting recitations (discussions). Though your old notes may not be exactly what you need to do the job, they will provide a start.\n"}, {"score": 1233.386, "uuid": "770336bb-1b60-520d-915e-6f3a8782becc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-79-26988", "target_hostname": "framingham.edu", "target_uri": "http://framingham.edu/psychology-and-philosophy/academic-assistance/index.html", "page_rank": 1.2137042e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Framingham State University - <em>Psychology</em> and <em>Philosophy</em> - Academic Assistance", "snippet": "No later than the second semester junior year, students <em>should</em> enroll <em>in</em> the first of the 3 required research courses (Research Methods <em>I</em>).

The Dean wants this by the end of the semester.\nPromoting undergraduate research.\nHolding a workshop for English majors considering graduate school.\nPerhaps bringing in the new Career Resource Specialist to talk to majors about careers one can pursue with an English major.\nCalling for course descriptions.\nReviving and updating our Facebook page for majors.\nPlanning an end-of-year reception or something similar for our graduating English majors.\nPlanning a reception for English majors as part of Honors Day.\nAfter Dr. Dudley left, the committee discussed all of these proposals and decided to focus on several of them. To that end, we all took tasks: exploring the data to see what hiring we should recommend; trying to find out more about the number of majors we have and how many we might expect to graduate in Spring 2011; researching restaurants and costs for a possible end-of-year banquet; planning a workshop on applying to graduate school; sending out a call for course descriptions to our faculty.\nThe meeting was adjourned at 1:50 p.m.\nRespectfully submitted by Mary Villeponteaux\nThe Major Program Committee met on Tuesday, September 29, to discuss a new rotation plan for major courses at the 3000 level and above. Lloyd opined that at 50 we have far too many such courses on the books but that course combinations or reductions practically speaking are not an option. Of 9 3000+ courses this semester 3 have enrollments below the 15 minimum set for future semesters by Dean Smith; a fourth is at fifteen counting graduate and undergraduate students. The committee discussed a \"wheels within wheels\" rotation schedule that was concocted by Lloyd to facilitate discussion, not be acted on. The majority of courses were on a three year rotation with others (depending on function and need) in two and one year rotations, with a Senior Seminar each semester. The committee discussed the need to place some courses on less than three year rotations. This took up much of the meeting. The question was raised as to whether we are allowed to place courses on three year rotations. [After the meeting, David Dudley checked up the line and advised the committee that there should be no procedural problem]. The committee goal is to have a course rotation to present to the Department before Thanksgiving.\nMeeting Date: 31 October 2008\nAttending: Lloyd, Griffin, Costomiris, Whelan, Kundu\nThe committee met to discuss the new senior seminar which is to be offered as part of the revision of the English major. The committee was charged (after the department meeting of 24 October 2008) with developing more concrete guidelines and outcomes for the senior seminar in order to insure a consistent experience for students. The committee unanimously agreed to recommend the following guidelines for the senior seminar.\nA) Guidelines at the Departmental Level:\n1) Only 12 students will be allowed in each section of the senior seminar. If necessary, up to 15 students per seminar are permissible. If a sufficient number of students wishes to enroll in a senior seminar in a given term, the chair may offer a second section if someone is available to teach it.\n2) At least one section of the senior seminar will be offered in both Fall and Spring semesters.\n3) Students may take the senior seminar only after completing 18 hours of upper division English courses.\n4) Advisors will monitor students\u2019 progress to assure that they take the senior seminar at the appropriate time in their course of study.\n5) The department chair will establish and publicize a tentative rotation of courses (including seminar topics) 1-2 years in advance so that students and faculty will know ahead of time what senior seminars will be offered in the coming 12-24 months.\n6) Success of the senior seminar experience will be assessed by the professor responsible in a brief report submitted to the chair. Such reports should help the department chair in SACS program review.\n7) As many tenured and tenure-track faculty as possible should participate in teaching the senior seminar.\nB) Guidelines for the Seminar:\n1) Students will make two presentations to the seminar consisting of the following.\na) A short (of 10-15 minute duration) critical analysis of an academic essay, a book, a primary text, or other course-relevant material assigned by the professor. This should occur early in the term as a prelude to the student\u2019s own research later in the term.\nb) A short oral version of the student\u2019s \u201cin-progress\u201d seminar paper. This will occur at the end of the term.\nBefore the presentation, professors will provide students with a rubric detailing the required structure and format. They will also advise students on how to conduct themselves during the presentation and on how they will be evaluated.\n2) In the process of researching the seminar paper, students will consult a sufficient number of primary and secondary sources (approved by the professor) in order to demonstrate their competency in the subject.\n3) Students must meet with the professor to discuss their progress on the seminar paper.\n4) Class will meet in seminar format, i.e, once per week for 150 minutes.\n5) Class will meet every week for the first nine weeks of the semester during which time the primary texts will be discussed and the critical issues adumbrated. During weeks 10-12 the seminar will not meet formally, rather students will meet with the professor to discuss their own research projects. During weeks 13-15 the seminar will meet again to allow students to present their short oral versions of the seminar paper.\n6) To encourage a significant level of participation and engagement with all of the works on the syllabus, students will be evaluated not only on their seminar papers and oral presentations, but also on a number of short reaction papers to the works presented and discussed in the first nine weeks of the term. The final grade should be broken down in roughly the following way: final paper 75%; presentations and short reaction papers 25%\n7) There will be no final exam in this course.\nC) Outcomes:\n1) Students will demonstrate the ability to use a style guide to correctly document their work in MLA style.\n2) Students will demonstrate mastery of literary/textual analysis, research methods, and resources (both electronic and paper) appropriate to the discipline.\n3) In a 15-20 page research paper (not counting notes and Works Cited pages), students will identify a critical problem in a literary work, demonstrate their understanding of the critical debate related to this problem, and arrive at a satisfying synthesis of the critical heritage and their own original thesis on the subject.\n4) Students will demonstrate proficiency in publicly presenting their work via oral presentations to the seminar.\nMajor Program Committee Minutes\nMeeting Date: 19 September 2008\nAttending: Lloyd, Griffin, Costomiris, Whelan\nAbsent: Kundu\nThe committee met to discuss the new senior seminar which is to be offered as part of the revision of the English major. Those attending the meeting unanimously recommend that the department adopt the following guidelines for the senior seminar.\n1) 12 students per seminar is ideal. No more than 15 students in any instance. If more than 15 students enroll in a seminar, another section will be opened.\n2) One senior seminar / semester will be offered for a total of two / year.\n3) Students may take the senior seminar only after completing 18 hours of upper division English courses.\n4) Advisors will monitor students\u2019 progress to assure that students take the senior seminar at the appropriate time.\n5) The department chair will establish a rotation of courses 1-2 years in advance so that students and faculty will know what senior senior seminar topics will be offered during the next 12-24 months.\n6) Minimum requirements for students in the senior seminar:\n1) a 15-20 page research paper based on original research.\n2) Students must identify a critical problem and demonstrate their understanding of the critical debate about this problem.\n7) Success of the senior seminar experience will be assessed by the professor in a brief report submitted to the chair. Such reports should help the department chair in SACS program review.\n8) In order to demonstrate the accomplishments of the department as a whole, all tenured and tenure-track faculty should participate in teaching the senior seminar.\n9) Proposed topics for the senior seminar will be presented to and approved by the department\nMajor Program Committee Minutes\nMeeting Date: 10 September 2008\nAttending: Lloyd, Kundu, Griffin, Costomiris, Whelan\nAbsent: none\nThe committee met to discuss how to configure the new senior seminar which is to be offered as part of the revision of the English Major. No recommendation was reached.\nMajor Program Committee Minutes\nMeeting Date: 3 September 2008\nAttending: Lloyd, Kundu, Griffin, Costomiris, Whelan\nAbsent: none\nThe committee met to discuss the progress on the paperwork involved to complete the revisions to the English major.\nThe number of units required for the English minor was also discussed and no change was recommended.\nAt the request of Dr. Dudley, the committee also discussed how the American Dream course might continue to be offered via UGA distance learning.\nTo: Faculty of the Department of Literature and Philosophy\nFrom: Major Program Committee\nSubject: Response to Faculty Suggestions Regarding the English Major Proposal Presented to the Department on 2/8/08\nDate: 3 April 2008\nPreamble:\nAfter presenting the proposal to revise the English Major to the department on 2/8/08, the committee solicited comments from the faculty. Six people responded with comments ranging from very particular issues to entirely different revision schemes. The committee met 5 times to discuss these suggestions and offers its response below. We have tried to address all the suggestions that came in and provide a rationale for all of our decisions. The committee appreciates the department\u2019s contribution to this process. We believe the new proposal is stronger as a result and one that the department can embrace.\nI. Concerning the Composition of Area F\nA) Number of British and American Surveys\nSome members of the department advocated requiring students to take only one each of the British Literature and American Literature surveys. The committee considered this recommendation but, after canvassing other members of the department and examining the issue again, we decided to keep the requirement that students take both British Literature surveys and one of the American surveys. This is our current practice so, in effect, we are not changing anything here.\nOur decision is based on the following:\n1) Familiarity with the full range of British literature is important to the study of all literature in English.\n2) The longer chronology of British Literature means that both semesters of Brit Lit cover a longer span of years than either of their American Lit counterparts. As a result, a student who takes only one Brit Lit survey misses exposure to relatively greater swath of literary history than a student who takes only one American survey.\n3) Students have more exposure to American literature in high school than they do to British literature\n4) Students going to graduate school or becoming high school teachers are usually expected to demonstrate a knowledge of the full range of British Literature.\nB) Prerequisites for the British and American Surveys\nThe committee agreed with the suggestion that Engl 1101 and 1102 should be prerequisites to taking Brit/Amer surveys, but recommends that Engl 2111 and 2112 no longer be prerequisites for the Brit/Amer surveys once they become 2000 level courses.\nC) Anglophone Literature instead of American and British Surveys\nThe committee does not recommend substituting two surveys titled Anglophone Literature for the more traditional British and American Literature surveys. No other university in the state treats the surveys in this manner and students might find it difficult to transfer such course credits to other institutions who continue to use more traditional nomenclature.\nD) Place of British and American Surveys within a Student\u2019s Course of Study\nThe committee recommends that two of the three Brit/Amer surveys serve as prerequisites for upper division coursework in place of our current practice which uses the World Literature surveys as prerequisites for upper division coursework. The introductory nature of the Brit/Amer surveys suggests that students should take them before embarking on more in-depth upper division coursework. Taking these surveys before upper division courses will also give a student some insight in selecting elective courses.\nEnglish 2111 will still be part of a student\u2019s Area F requirements and English 2112 will still be part of Area C, but a student need not complete them before enrolling in upper division courses\nE) Courses within the Area F Grab Bag\nThe committee accepted the recommendation that we remove Psychology from the grab bag and replace it with Introduction to Religion (RELS 2130). The committee felt that current emphases in the field of psychology are not as relevant to literary study as they once were and that Introduction to Religion would be more beneficial our majors overall.\nII. Concerning Introduction to Literary Studies\nA) Placement of Course\nSome members of the department advocated moving Intro to Literary Studies to Area F in conjunction with requiring only one British and one American survey. Our recommendation to require three surveys necessitates leaving Introduction to Literary Studies as part of the major requirements if we are to maintain any degree of choice for students from the grab bag part of Area F.\nB) Numbering of Course\nIn an effort to achieve some of the goals of those who advocate placing Introduction to Literary Studies within Area F, the committee recommends that we NOT make this a 3000 level course as we first proposed, but instead keep it as a 2000 level course even though it will fall within the major requirements. This is actually our current practice and affords us the benefit of allowing students to take an additional English course at the 3000 level and above, and still not exceed the CLASS limit of 30 hours devoted to Major Requirements.\nC) Title of Course\nThe committee supports keeping the title to this course as is. This title is common amongst English majors at other universities yet sufficiently vague to allow for a variety of emphases according to the professor teaching it.\nD) Prerequisites for Course\nThe committee decided to remove any prerequisites for this course other than English 1101 and 1102 in order to encourage students to take this course early in their careers.\nIII. Concerning the Major Requirements\nSuggestions regarding the Major Requirements centered on two issues: how the courses were distributed across the four recommended areas, and the number of required courses. We received two competing suggestions: one suggested requiring only one course, reducing the number of course offerings in Areas 1, 2, and 3 and greatly expanding the courses and hours devoted to Area 4; another suggested spreading all of our courses more evenly across three broad areas while also increasing the number of elective hours. The committee recommends taking a middle path that will maximize student choice in all of the areas while still affording the student a lot of latitude to choose elective courses. It will be helpful to look at the attached spreadsheet of distribution requirements when reading the committee\u2019s response to this section.\nA) American Realism and American Romanticism\nThe committee continues to recommend two 19th century American Literature courses. American Realism and American Romanticism are commonly found in other English majors in the state of Georgia and offer students more choice within Area 3.\nB) British Novel and American Novel Courses\nOne colleague suggested that the American and British novel courses be moved to Area 4 on the grounds that they are genre courses and not historical surveys. The committee feels, however, that when these courses are provided with definable periods that they will effectively serve a survey type function. Taking these courses out of Areas 2 and 3 also reduces the overall number of courses within these areas and thus limits students options to choose within those areas.\nC) Studies in Drama Courses\nIn a concomitant development, the committee has adopted the scheme found in one of the proposals that keeps drama courses an integral part of the literary periods comprising Areas 1, 2, and 3. Thus we recommend three classes as follows: in Area 1, Studies in British Drama up to the Restoration; in Area 2, Studies in British Drama from the Restoration to the Present; and in Area 3, Studies in American Drama. This change would move some courses out of Area 4 by eliminating English 5333, Studies in British Drama, and English 5335, Modern Drama. Only English 5330, World Drama, would remain in Area 4. This change would also offer students more choice within Areas 1, 2, and 3.\nD) Multi-Cultural Lit Course\nIn response to the suggestion that the department offer a multi-cultural American Literature course, the committee recognizes that such a course might be desirable but recommends that such a course first be offered as a Selected Topics course before it becomes a regular part of the rotation.\nE) Placement of Single Author Courses\nThe committee continues to recommend that the single-author courses of Shakespeare, Milton, and Chaucer remain in Area 1. Although these courses have no direct parallel in Areas 2 and 3, the Medieval and Early Modern periods are traditionally heavy in single-author courses and such courses are usually placed in the Early British literature areas of other English majors in the state.\nF) Senior Seminar\nThe committee recommends that the senior seminar be a separate class and not conflated with a single author course. The committee believes that if the senior seminar is to successfully do service as a SACS assessment tool, its distinctive nature should be clear to both faculty and students. Although the structure and desired \u201coutcomes\u201d of the senior seminar await a lengthier discussion by the English faculty, the committee wishes at this point to stress the importance of maintaining a small seminar environment with a maximum of 12 students in order to insure that the class is clearly a \u201ccapstone\u201d experience.\nG) Clarification of Hours Applicable to Each of the Four Areas.\nBecause there was some confusion about how many hours a student may apply to each of the four areas, the committee has placed a minimum and maximum number of hours at the head of each of the four areas. We hope that this change will make clear that a student who wishes to take twelve hours from Area 4 may do so, but also that a student must take at least six hours from that area.\nEnglish Major Program Committee\nRecommendations for Area F Requirements, 18 hours total\nApril 11, 2008\n"}, {"score": 1221.6342, "uuid": "0bb48036-d2db-5d2a-9422-e8119f559f6a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-51-06671", "target_hostname": "www.iep.utm.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-psy/", "page_rank": 1.1825239e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Evolutionary <em>Psychology</em> [Internet Encyclopedia of <em>Philosophy</em>]", "snippet": "\u201cReview of Richardson\u2019s Evolutionary <em>Psychology</em> as Maladapted <em>Psychology</em>.\u201d <em>In</em>: New Horizons <em>in</em> <em>Psychology</em>.

Historic and Systematic Roots\nModern Evolutionary Psychology has its roots in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when psychologist Leda Cosmides and anthropologist John Tooby from Harvard joined the anthropologist Donald Symons at The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) where they currently co-direct the Center for Evolutionary Psychology. It gained wide attention in 1992 with the publication of the landmark volume The Adapted Mind by Jerome Barkow, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, and since then numerous textbooks (for example, Buss 1999) and popular presentations (for example, Pinker 1997, 2002; Wright 1994) have appeared. These days, Evolutionary Psychology is a powerful research program that has generated some interesting research, but it has also sparked a heated debate about its aspirations and limitations (see, for example, Rose and Rose 2000).\nEvolutionary Psychology is effectively a theory about How the Mind Works (Pinker 1997). The human mind is not an all-purpose problem solver relying on a limited number of general principles that are universally applied to all problems\u2014a view that dominated early artificial intelligence (AI) and behaviorism (for example, Skinner 1938, 1957). (For the idea of an all-purpose problem solver see, for example, Newell and Simon 1972; for some of the earliest AI work related to this idea see, for example, Newell and Simon 1961, Newell et al. 1958.) Rather, the human mind is a collection of independent, task-specific cognitive mechanisms, a collection of instincts adapted for solving evolutionary significant problems. The human mind is sort of a Swiss Army knife (Pinker 1994). This conception of the mind is based on three important ideas adopted from other disciplines (Cosmides and Tooby 2003, 54; Samuels 1998, 577): the computational model of the mind, the assumption of modularity, and the thesis of adaptationism.\na. The Computational Model of the Mind\nFollowing the development of modern logic (Boole 1847; Frege 1879) and the formalization of the notion of computation (Turing 1936), early AI construed logical operations as mechanically executable information processing routines. Eventually, this led to the idea that mental processes (for example, reasoning) and mental states (for example, beliefs and desires) may themselves also be analyzable in purely syntactic terms. The \u201cComputational Theory of Mind,\u201d developed by philosophers like Hilary Putnam (1963) and Jerry Fodor (1975, 1981), for instance, conceives of mental states as relations between a thinker and symbolic representations of the content of the states, and of mental processes as formal operations on the syntactic features of those representations.\nEvolutionary Psychology endorses the computational model of the mind as an information processing system or a formal symbol manipulator and thus treats the mind as a collection of \u201ccomputational machines\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 2003, 54) or \u201cinformation-processing mechanisms\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990a, 21) that receive input from the environment and produce behavior or physiological changes as output. To this, it adds an evolutionary perspective: \u201cThe evolutionary function of the human brain is to process information in ways that lead to adaptive behavior; the mind is a description of the operation of a brain that maps informational input onto behavioral output\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 282). The brain is thus not just like a computer. \u201cIt is a computer\u2014that is, a physical system that was designed to process information\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 16; italics added).\nThe Computational Model of the Mind: The human mind is an information processing system, physically realized in the brain, and can be described at a computational level as a device whose evolutionary function is to process information by mapping informational input onto behavioral output.\nb. The Modularity of Mind\nEarly attempts at simulating human intelligence revealed that artificial cognitive systems that are not already equipped with a fair amount of \u201cinnate knowledge\u201d about a particular problem domain are unable to solve even the easiest problems (see, for example, the idea of \u201cscripts\u201d in Schank and Abelson 1977). In the 1970s and 1980s, the work of scientists like Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor, or David Marr further undermined the idea of the mind as a \u201cblank slate\u201d which acquires knowledge about the world by means of only a couple of general learning mechanisms. Their findings suggested instead that the mind incorporates a number of cognitive subsystems that are triggered only by a certain kind of input. While Marr (1982) was working on the neuroscience of vision, Chomsky famously criticized the behaviorist idea that language acquisition is just an ordinary kind of learning that follows the stimulus-response model by proving the intractability of some learning algorithms (see, for example, his 1959 review of Skinner\u2019s Verbal Behavior or Chomsky 1957; for a later statement of similar ideas see Chomsky 1975). According to his \u201cPoverty of the Stimulus\u201d argument, a child cannot learn her first language through observation because the available stimuli (that is, the utterances of adult speakers) neither enable her to produce grammatically correct nor prevent her from producing grammatically incorrect sentences. Instead, Chomsky argued, we possess a \u201clanguage acquisition device\u201d which, rather than extracting all information from the world through some general mechanism, comes already equipped with a certain amount of \u201cinnate knowledge.\u201d Just as our body contains a number of innate, genetically predisposed organs that serve a specific function, our mind also contains a number of information processing systems (like the language acquisition device), so called mental organs or modules in Fodor\u2019s (1983) terminology, that are designed to perform a particular cognitive function.\nThe model of the mind as a general learning mechanism that is indiscriminately applied to any problem domain was also disconfirmed in other areas of cognitive science. Garcia and Koelling (1966) showed that while rats can learn some associations by means of stimulus-response mechanisms, others, albeit structurally similar, cannot be learned at all, or only much slower: rats that are given food that makes them nauseous subsequently avoid that kind of food, but they are unable to learn an association between a sound or a light and feeling nauseous. Galef (1990) demonstrated that rats readily eat a new kind of food if they smell it at another rat\u2019s mouth, but not if they smell it at another part of the body. Mineka and Cook (1988) showed that a laboratory raised monkey that initially did not show fear of snakes started to do so once he observed another monkey exhibiting fear of snakes; yet, he didn\u2019t start to show fear of flowers when observing the other doing so. Comparable \u201clearning biases\u201d have been found for humans in various areas (for example, Cook et al. 1986; Marks and Nesse 1994; Seligman and Hagar 1972).\nEvolutionary Psychologists conclude that the assumption that the human mind is composed mainly of a few content-free cognitive processes that are \u201cthought to govern how one acquires a language and a gender identity, an aversion to incest and an appreciation for vistas, a desire for friends and a fear of spiders\u2014indeed, nearly every thought and feeling of which humans are capable\u201d (Ermer et al. 2007, 155) is inadequate. Such mechanisms would be \u201climited to knowing what can be validly derived by general processes from perceptual information\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 92) and thus incapable of efficiently solving adaptive problems (see section 2d ). Instead, Evolutionary Psychologists claim, \u201cour cognitive architecture resembles a confederation of hundreds or thousands of functionally dedicated computers\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1995, xiii), the so-called \u201cmodules\u201d:\nModularity: The mind consists of a (possibly large) number of domain-specific, innately specified cognitive subsystems, called \u201cmodules.\u201d\nc. Adaptationism\nSince cognitive mechanisms are not directly observable, studying them requires some indirect way of discovering them (see section 2b ). Evolutionary Psychologists adopt the kind of adaptationist reasoning well known from evolutionary biology that also characterizes many works in sociobiology (Wilson 1975). Ever since Charles Darwin (1859/1964) proposed his theory of evolution by natural selection, evolutionary biologists quite successfully offer adaptationist explanations of physiological features of living things that explain the presence of a trait by claiming that it is an adaptation, that is, a trait current organisms possess because it enhanced their ancestors\u2019 fitness. During the 1970s, sociobiologists argued that \u201csocial behaviors [too] are shaped by natural selection\u201d (Lumsden and Wilson 1981, 99; for the original manifesto of sociobiology see Wilson 1975) and started to seek adaptationist explanations for cognitive, cultural, and social traits, like the ability to behave altruistically, different mating preferences in males and females, or the frequently observed parent-offspring conflicts.\nEvolutionary Psychologists have inherited sociobiology\u2019s adaptationist program: \u201cThe core idea \u2026 is that many psychological characteristics are adaptations\u2014just as many physical characteristics are\u2014and that the principles of evolutionary biology that are used to explain our bodies are equally applicable to our minds\u201d (Durrant and Ellis 2003, 5). Our mind, they argue, is a complex, functionally integrated collection of cognitive mechanisms, and since the only known natural process that can bring about such functional complexity is evolution by natural selection (Cosmides and Tooby 1991, 493; Symons 1987, 126; Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 382), these cognitive mechanisms are likely to be adaptations to the adaptive problems of our ancestors. This, Evolutionary Psychologists hold, intimately links psychology with evolutionary theory: \u201cBecause the architecture of the human mind acquired its functional organization through the evolutionary process, theories of adaptive function are the logical foundation on which to build theories of the design of cognitive mechanisms\u201d (Ermer et al. 2007, 153\u20134). While evolutionary theory is used to describe the relevant ancestral problems and to make educated guesses about the information processing cognitive mechanisms that have been shaped by natural selection in response, the task of psychology is to establish that current humans actually possess these mechanisms (see section 2b ).\nAdaptationism: The human mind, like any other complex feature, was shaped by a process of evolution through natural selection. Its subsystems, the modules, are adaptations for solving recurrent information processing problems that arose in our ancestors\u2019 evolutionary environment.\n2. Key Concepts and Arguments\nAccording to Evolutionary Psychology, the human mind is a set of cognitive adaptations designed by natural selection. Since such design takes time, the adaptive problems that shaped our mind are not the ones we know from our life as industrialists during the past 200 years, or from our life as agriculturalists during the past 10,000 years, but those characteristic of our past life as hunter-gatherers. Since these problems varied considerably, the human mind contains many problem-specific adaptations. The task of Evolutionary Psychology is to discover these modules by means of what is called a \u201cfunctional analysis,\u201d where one starts with hypotheses about the adaptive problems faced by our ancestors, and then tries to infer the cognitive adaptations that must have evolved to solve them.\nThis theoretical framework of Evolutionary Psychology centers on a couple of key ideas which will be explained in this section: (1) The cognitive mechanisms that underlie our behavior are adaptations. (2) They have to be discovered by means of functional analysis. (3) They are adaptations for solving recurrent adaptive problems in the evolutionary environment of our ancestors. (4) Our mind is a complex set of such mechanisms, or domain-specific modules. (5) These modules define our universal human nature.\na. Adaptation and Adaptivity\nThat our evolutionary history influenced not only our bodies, but also our brains, and thus our minds, is not very controversial. But how exactly has evolution affected the way we are, mind-wise? How exactly can evolutionary theory elucidate the structure and function of the human mind?\nIt may seem that \u201cbehavioral traits are like any other class of characters\u201d (Futuyama 1998, 579), so that they can be subject to natural selection in the same way as physiological traits. In that case, an evolutionary study of human behavior could then proceed by studying behavioral variants and see which of them are adaptive and which selectively neutral or detrimental. However, since natural selection is heritable variation in fitness, it can act only on entities that are transmitted between generations, and behavior as such is not directly transmitted between generations, but only via the genes that code for the proximal cognitive mechanisms that trigger it. Hence, \u201c[t]o speak of natural selection as selecting for \u2018behaviors\u2019 is a convenient shorthand, but it is misleading usage. \u2026 Natural selection cannot select for behavior per se; it can only select for mechanisms that produce behavior\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 281).\nHence, an evolutionary approach to human psychology must proceed by studying the cognitive mechanisms that underlie our behavior: \u201cIn the rush to apply evolutionary insights to a science of human behavior, many researchers have made a conceptual \u2018wrong turn,\u2019 \u2026 [which] has consisted of attempting to apply evolutionary theory directly to the level of manifest behavior, rather than using it as a heuristic guide for the discovery of innate psychological mechanisms\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 278\u20139). By sharply distinguishing between adaptive behavior and the cognitive mechanisms that are adaptations for producing adaptive behavior, Evolutionary Psychologists provide \u201cthe missing link between evolutionary theory and manifest behavior\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1989, 37). [The drawback is that things become more complicated since \"it is less easy to sustain claims that a trait is a product of natural selection than claims that it confers reproductive benefits on individuals in contemporary populations\" (Caro and Borgerhoff Mulder 1987, 66). Section 2b shows how Evolutionary Psychologists try to cope with this difficulty, and section 5a discusses a version of evolutionary psychology that focuses on adaptive behavior.]\nWe quite often do things detrimental to survival and reproduction (we use contraceptives, consume unhealthy doses of fatty food, and blow ourselves up in the middle of crowded market places). We also willfully refrain from doing things that would be conducive to survival (buy some healthy food, exercise) or boost our potential for reproduction (donate our sperm or eggs to cryobanks). If Evolutionary Psychology is right that our mind contains cognitive mechanisms that are adaptations for producing adaptive behavior, then why are we behaving maladaptively so often?\nThe claim that the brain is an adaptation for producing adaptive behavior does not entail that it is currently producing adaptive behavior. Adaptations are traits that are present today because of the selective advantage they offered in the past, and the past environment arguably differed notably from the current one. The modern metropolis in which we live in unprecedented large groups, consume fast food and use contraceptives is not even 100 years old, and even agriculture arose only some 10,000 years ago. Compared to this, our ancestors spent an unimaginably long time in Pleistocene conditions (roughly, the period spanning 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago) living in small nomadic hunter-gatherer bands. The cognitive mechanisms produced by natural selection are adaptations for producing adaptive behavior in these circumstances, not for playing chess, passing logic exams, navigating through lower Manhattan, or keeping ideal weight in an environment full of fast food restaurants. [Which is why we are so bad at these things: \"it is highly unlikely that the cognitive architecture of the human mind includes procedures that are dedicated to solving any of these problems: The ability to solve them would not have enhanced the survival or reproduction of the average Pleistocene hunter-gatherer\" and hence \"the performance of modern humans on such tasks is generally poor and uneven\" (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 95).]\nAmong the day-to-day problems of our ancestors that shaped the human mind are: \u201cgiving birth, winning social support from band members, remembering the locations of edible plants, hitting game animals with projectiles, \u2026, recognizing emotional expressions, protecting family members, maintaining mating relationships, \u2026, assessing the character of self and others, causing impregnation, acquiring language, maintaining friendships, thwarting antagonists, and so on\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 2003, 59). In these areas, we still behave the way we do because our behavior is guided by cognitive mechanisms that have been selected for because they produced behavior that was adaptive in our ancestors\u2019 evolutionary environment. As Evolutionary Psychologists colorfully put it: \u201cOur modern skulls house a Stone Age mind\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1997, 85).\nIt is thus crucial to distinguish between a trait\u2019s being an adaptation and its being adaptive. A trait is an adaptation if it was \u201cdesigned\u201d by natural selection to solve the specific problems posed by the regularities of the physical, chemical, ecological, informational, and social environments encountered by the ancestors of a species during the course of its evolution\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 383), while a trait is adaptive if it currently enhances its bearer\u2019s fitness. Since the environment in which a trait was selected for may differ from the current one, \u201c[t]he hypothesis that a trait is an adaptation does not imply that the trait is currently adaptive\u201d (Symons 1990, 430). But if cognitive adaptations can neither be discovered in the brain, nor by observing current human behavior, how can they be studied?\nb. Functional Analysis\nVerifying the claim that a trait is an adaptation is difficult because this is essentially a historical claim. A trait is an adaptation because it was adaptive in the past, and it is unclear what the past was like, let alone what would have been adaptive under past conditions. According to Evolutionary Psychology, however, it is possible to verify adaptationist claims:\nResearchers can identify an aspect of an organism\u2019s physical, developmental, or psychological structure \u2026 as an adaptation by showing that (1) it has many design features that are improbably well suited to solving an ancestral adaptive problem, (2) these phenotypic properties are unlikely to have arisen by chance alone, and (3) they are not better explained as the by-product of mechanisms designed to solve some alternative adaptive problem or some more inclusive class of adaptive problem. Finding that a reliably developing feature of the species\u2019 architecture solves an adaptive problem with reliability, precision, efficiency, and economy is prima facie evidence that an adaptation has been located. (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 28)\nWhat Tooby and Cosmides suggest is a procedure known as functional analysis. One uses evolutionary reasoning to identify the adaptive problems our ancestors presumably awaited in their evolutionary environment, infers from this the cognitive mechanisms that one thinks must have evolved to solve these problems, conducts psychological experiments to show that they are actually found in current human beings, and rules out alternative explanations.\nA bit more precisely, identifying adaptations by means of functional analysis proceeds in six steps (Tooby and Cosmides 1989, 40\u20131):\nStep 1 uses evolutionary considerations to formulate a model of the past adaptive problems the human mind had to solve.\nStep 2 generates hypotheses about exactly how these problems would have manifested themselves under the selection pressures present in the evolutionary environment of our ancestors.\nStep 3 formulates a \u201ccomputational theory\u201d that specifies \u201ca catalog of the specific information processing problems\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 289) that had to be solved to overcome the adaptive problems identified in step 2.\nStep 4 uses the computational theory \u201cas a heuristic for generating testable hypotheses about the structure of the cognitive programs that solve the adaptive problems in question\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 302).\nStep 5 rules out alternative accounts of the cognitive mechanisms in question that do not treat them as the result of evolution by natural selection.\nStep 6 tests the adaptationist hypotheses by checking whether modern Homo sapiens indeed possess the cognitive mechanisms postulated in step 4. If this test is successful, Evolutionary Psychologists contend, it is quite likely that the cognitive mechanisms are indeed adaptations for solving the problems identified in step 1. (For examples of empirical research that, by and large, follow this theoretical framework, see section 3 .)\n(One may add a seventh step which tries to discover the neural basis of the cognitive mechanisms, so that eventually theories of adaptive problems guide the search for the cognitive mechanisms that solve them, while knowing what cognitive mechanisms exist in turn guides the search for their neural basis.)\nThe procedure of functional analysis shows what sort of evidence would support the claim that a cognitive mechanism is an adaptation for solving a given adaptive problem. However, since functional analysis itself relies on hypotheses about the adaptive problems prevalent in our ancestors\u2019 past, the obvious question is: How can we today know with any certainty which adaptive problems our ancestors faced?\nc. The Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness\nSince the \u201cdescription of ancestral conditions is one indispensable aspect of characterizing an adaptation\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 387), discovering the mind\u2019s modules requires knowing what exactly the environment that Bowlby (1969) calls the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA) looked like. The human EEA consists in the set of environmental conditions encountered by human populations during the Pleistocene (from 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago), when early hominids lived on the savannahs of eastern Africa as hunter-gatherers. Yet, the EEA \u201cis not a place or a habitat, or even a time period. Rather, it is a statistical composite of the adaptation-relevant properties of the ancestral environments encountered by members of ancestral populations, weighted by their frequency and fitness consequences\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 386\u20137). More specifically, it is a \u201ccomposite of environmental properties of the most recent segment of a species\u2019 evolution that encompasses the period during which its modern collection of adaptations assumed their present form\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 388). Importantly, \u201cdifferent adaptations will have different EEAs. Some, like language, are firmly anchored in approximately the last two million years; others, such as infant attachment, reflect a much lengthier evolutionary history\u201d (Durrant and Ellis 2003, 10). Speaking about the EEA is thus at least misleading, since strictly speaking one has to distinguish between the EEA of a species and the EEA of particular cognitive adaptations.\nThere are two crucial questions with regard to the EEA: First, why suppose that our cognitive mechanisms, even if they are adaptations, are adaptations to exactly the problems faced by our ancestors in the EEA? Second, how can we today determine the EEA of a particular adaptation in enough detail?\nEvolutionary Psychologists offer two related arguments in response to the first question. The first draws attention to the large amount of time our ancestors spent in Pleistocene conditions compared to the brief stretch of time that has passed since the advent of agriculture or industrialization: \u201cOur species spent over 99% of its evolutionary history as hunter-gatherers in Pleistocene environments. Human psychological mechanisms should be adapted to those environments, not necessarily to the twentieth-century industrialized world\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 280). The second argument maintains that since natural selection is a slow process, there just have not been enough generations for it to design new cognitive mechanisms that are well-adapted to our post-agricultural industrial life: \u201cIt is no more plausible to believe that whole new mental organs could evolve since the Pleistocene \u2026 than it is to believe that whole new physical organs such as eyes would evolve over brief spans. \u2026 [and] major and intricate changes in innately specified information-processing procedures present in human psychological mechanisms do not seem likely to have taken place over brief spans of historical time\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1989, 34).\nBoth arguments seem to suffer from the same difficulty. The 10,000 years that have passed since the Pleistocene correspond to roughly 400 generations, and if the selection pressure and the heritability (roughly, a measure of the response to selection) are high enough, quite a lot can happen in 400 generations. In particular, no one needs to hold that \u201cwhole new mental organs could evolve since the Pleistocene.\u201d In order to undermine the claim that we are walking fossils with Stone Age minds in our heads, it is sufficient to show that significant changes can occur within 400 generations. The same observation threatens the first argument: How much time our ancestors spent in one environment as compared to another is completely irrelevant, if the selection pressures in one differ radically from those in the other.\nIn response to the second question, Evolutionary Psychologists point out that, first, we can be relatively sure that the physical conditions were comparable to the ones today\u2014\u201dan enormous number of factors, from the properties of light to chemical laws to the existence of parasites, have stably endured\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 390)\u2014and, second, we can be relatively certain on paleontological grounds that a great deal of our ancestors spend a great deal of their time on African savannahs as hunter-gatherers. Yet, since it is in response to the social problems faced by our ancestors that our cognitive adaptations are said to have evolved, what matters is not so much the physical environment (which may have stayed constant, by and large) but the social environment, and the question is what we can know with any certainty about the social life of our ancestors, given that social traits do not fossilize.\nEvolutionary Psychologists contend that with regard to the social environment little has changed, too: our ancestors arguably had to attract and retain mates, provide care for their children, understand the intentions and emotions of those with whom they engaged in social exchange, and so forth, just as we do. However, such general knowledge about the EEA seems to be of little use, for discovering cognitive adaptations requires formulating a computational theory that provides \u201ca catalog of the specific information processing problems\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 289; italics added), and that goes significantly beyond being told that our ancestors had to find mates, care for children, find food and so forth (for more on this see section 4c ).\nd. Domain-specificity and Modularity\nEmpiricism in philosophy, behaviorism in psychology and the rules and representation approach to artificial cognitive systems characteristic of GOFAI (\u201cgood old fashioned artificial intelligence\u201d), roughly speaking, shared the belief that our mind contains only a few domain-general cognitive mechanisms that account for everything we can learn, be it speaking and understanding a language, solving algebra equations, playing chess or driving a bike. In contrast, Evolutionary Psychologists insist that \u201c[f]rom an evolutionary perspective, the human cognitive architecture is far more likely to resemble a confederation of hundreds or thousands of functionally dedicated computers \u2026 than it is to resemble a single general purpose computer equipped with a small number of domain-general procedures\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 2000, 1171).\nEvolutionary Psychologists have advanced three arguments for this modularity, or massive modularity, hypothesis. In short, a domain-general psychological architecture cannot guide behavior in ways that promote fitness for at least three related reasons:\nWhat counts as fit behavior differs from domain to domain, so there is no domain-general criterion of success or failure that correlates with fitness.\nAdaptive courses of action can be neither deduced nor learned by general criteria, because they depend on statistical relationships between features of the environment, behavior, and fitness that emerge over many generations and are, therefore, not observable during a single lifetime.\nCombinatorial explosion paralyzes any truly domain-general system when encountering real-world complexity. (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 91)\nSimply put, the idea behind the first argument is that \u201c[t]here is no such thing as a \u2018general problem solver\u2019 because there is no such thing as a general problem\u201d (Symons 1992, 142). Our ancestors faced a host of different adaptive problems, and \u201cdifferent adaptive problems frequently have different optimal solutions\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1991, 500): what counts as a successful solution to one, say choosing a mate, arguably differs from what counts as a successful solution to another, say choosing nutritious food. Hence, there is no domain-general criterion of success or failure: \u201cA woman who used the same taste preference mechanisms in choosing a mate that she used to choose nutritious foods would choose a very strange mate indeed, and such a design would rapidly select itself out\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 90). Hence, because different solutions can be implemented only by different, functionally distinct mechanisms, there must be as many domain-specific subsystems as there are domains in which the definitions of successful behavior differ. \u201cThe human mind \u2026 is composed of many different programs for the same reason that a carpenter\u2019s toolbox contains many different tools: Different problems require different solutions\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 2000, 1168). In response to this argument, the critics have pointed out that there is no reason why a cognitive system that relies on a few domain-general mechanisms that are fed with innate domain-specific information should not be as good as a modular cognitive architecture (see, for example, Samuels 1998, 587).\nAccording to the second argument, a domain general decision rule such as \u201cDo that which maximizes your inclusive fitness\u201d cannot efficiently guide behavior because whether or not a behavior is fitness enhancing is something an individual often cannot find out within its own lifetime, given that the fitness impact of a design feature relative to alternative designs \u201cis inherently unobservable at the time the design alternative actually impacts the world, and therefore cannot function as a cue for a decision rule\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990b, 417). As Buss has put it: \u201cthe relevant fitness information only becomes known generations later and hence is not accessible to individual actors\u201d (Buss 1995, 10). For instance, whether one should prefer fatty food over vegetables, or whether one should decide to have children with potential partner A or with rival B are behavioral decisions whose impact on one\u2019s fitness clearly cannot be learned empirically at the time these decisions have to be made. While in the former case, it may help to have a look at what others are doing, that strategy is of no avail in the latter case. And even in the former case the appeal to the possibility of learning from others only pushes the problem one step further because \u201c[i]mitation is useless unless those imitated have themselves solved the problem of the adaptive regulation of behavior\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, 295).\nAs Ermer et al. (2007) have put the point, the problem for domain-general cognitive architectures is that we are living in \u201cclueless environments\u201d:\nContent-free architectures are limited to knowing what can be validly derived by general processes from perceptual information available during an individual\u2019s lifetime. This sharply limits the range of problems they can solve: When the environment is clueless, the mechanism will be, too. Domain-specific mechanisms are not limited in this way. They can be constructed to embody clues that fill in the blanks when perceptual evidence is lacking or difficult to obtain (Ermer et al. 2007, 157).\nAt this point, a natural question to ask for the critic would be how natural selection is supposed to operate if \u201crelevant fitness information\u201d is indeed not available. As Buss puts it: would the result of a really \u201cclueless environment\u201d not be extinction, rather than adaptation?\nCosmides and Tooby\u2019s third argument for the claim that domain-general systems could not live up to the tasks our mind regularly solves concerns the general computational problems faced by such systems. As they put it, a domain-general architecture \u201cis defined by what it lacks: It lacks any content, either in the form of domain-specific knowledge or domain-specific procedures, that can guide it toward the solution of an adaptive problem\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 94). Therefore, they argue, a domain-general system must evaluate all alternatives it can define, and this raises an obvious problem: \u201cPermutations being what they are, alternatives increase exponentially as the problem complexity increases. By the time you analyze any biological problem of routine complexity, a mechanism that contains no domain-specific rules of relevance, procedural knowledge, or privileged hypotheses could not solve the problem in the amount of time the organism has to solve it\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1994, 94). Given that a specialization-free architecture contains no rules of relevance, or domain-specialized procedural knowledge, to restrict its search of a problem space, it could not solve any biological problem of routine complexity in time.\nThese theoretical considerations (see Samuels 1998 and Buller 2005, ch. 4 for criticism), together with the empirical support for the modularity hypothesis that comes from cognitive science (see section 1b ), have led Evolutionary Psychologists to the conclusion that \u201cthe mind is organized into modules or mental organs, each with a specialized design that makes it an expert in one area of interaction with the world\u201d (Pinker 1997, 21). The mind is a Swiss Army knife containing evolved, functionally specialized computational devices like, for example, \u201cface recognition systems, a language acquisition device, mindreading systems, navigation specializations, animate motion recognition, cheater detection mechanisms, and mechanisms that govern sexual attraction\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 2003, 63).\nAlthough there can be little doubt that the mind is modular to some extent, it is currently a hotly debated question exactly how modular it is. Is it really massively modular in the sense that it is a collection of hundreds or thousands of modules, or is it modular in a weaker sense (see, for example, the debate between Carruthers 2006, Prinz 2006, and Samuels 2006)? Interestingly, even the most ardent advocates of Evolutionary Psychology have recently acknowledged that \u201c[t]he mind presumably does contain a number of functionally specialized programs that are relatively content-free and domain-general,\u201d but they have insisted that \u201cthese can regulate behavior adaptively only if they work in tandem with a bevy of content-rich, domain-specialized ones \u2026\u201d (Ermer et al. 2007, 156; see also Tooby and Cosmides 1998, 200).\ne. Human Nature\nAccording to Evolutionary Psychologists, since the modules of which the human mind is made up have been constantly selected for during a vast stretch of time there is ample reason to think that \u201chuman universals \u2026 exist at the level of the functionally described psychological mechanism\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1989, 36; italics added). That is, the modules discovered by functional analysis constitute \u201can array of psychological mechanisms that is universal among Homo sapiens\u201d (Symons 1992, 139), they are \u201cthe psychological universals that constitute human nature\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990a, 19). As a consequence, Evolutionary Psychology has the potential to discover a \u201chuman nature [that] is everywhere the same\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1992, 38).\nApart from the observation that enough time has passed with constant selection pressures for our cognitive modules virtually being driven to fixation, Cosmides and Tooby have offered two arguments for the universality of our psychological adaptations (see also Buller 2005, 73\u20134). The first argument is more or less a plausibility argument, according to which since our bodies and our minds are both the result of evolution by natural selection, and our bodies are universal, so should be our minds:\n[T]he fact that any given page out of Gray\u2019s Anatomy describes in precise anatomical detail individual humans from around the world demonstrates the pronounced monomorphism present in complex human physiological adaptations. Although we cannot directly \u2018see\u2019 psychological adaptations \u2026, no less could be true of them. (Tooby and Cosmides 1992, 38)\nThe second argument first appeared in Tooby and Cosmides (1990a), has been repeated in Tooby and Cosmides (1992) and is treated by Evolutionary Psychologists as a definite proof of universal panhuman design. In a nutshell, the argument is that since in sexual reproduction a child\u2019s genome is a mixture of its father\u2019s and its mother\u2019s genes, and since cognitive adaptations are complex and thus not coded for by a single gene but require hundreds or thousands of genes to work in concert for their development, \u201cit is improbable that all of the genes necessary for a complex adaptation would be together in the same individual if the genes coding for the components of complex adaptations varied substantially between individuals\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1992, 78\u20139).\nIf there is a complex series of interdependent adaptations required to produce a sex, a behavioral strategy, or a personality type, there is only one way to ensure the necessary coordination. All of the parts of the genetic programs necessary to build the integrated design must be present when needed in every individual of a given type. The only way that the 50 genes, or 100 genes, or 1,000 genes that may be required to assemble all of the features defining a given type can rely on each other\u2019s mutual presence is that they are all present in every individual. (Tooby and Cosmides 1990a, 45)\nEvolutionary Psychologists are thus not claiming that human behavior or culture is the same everywhere. Quite obviously, there is significant behavioral and cultural diversity throughout the world. What they claim is that the genes that are required for our cognitive adaptations to develop, and thus the cognitive adaptations themselves, must be the same all over the world, although, of course, the behavior that results from them may differ (for more on this, see section 4a ).\n3. Examples of Empirical Research\nEvolutionary Psychology has sparked an enormous amount of empirical research covering nearly any imaginable topic, including issues as diverse as language, morality, emotions, parental investment, homicide, social coercion, rape, psychopathologies, landscape preferences, spatial abilities, or pregnancy sickness (see, for example, Buss 1999, 2005; Barkow et al. 1992 for an overview).\nFor instance, Margie Profet (1992) has argued that pregnancy sickness\u2014a set of symptoms like food aversion, nausea, and vomiting that some women experience during the first three months of pregnancy\u2014is an adaptation for protecting the embryo against maternal ingestion of toxins abundant in natural foods by lowering the typical human threshold of tolerance to toxins during the period of the embryo\u2019s maximum susceptibility to toxins. Irwin Silverman and Marion Eals (1992) have argued that from an evolutionary point of view the male advantage in spatial abilities usually found in psychological experiments does not make sense. Although hunting, the primary task of our male ancestors, clearly required spatial abilities, no less is true of gathering plants, the primary task of our female ancestors. In order to be efficient foragers, our female ancestors must have been able to encode and remember the locations of thousands of different plants. When Silverman and Eals designed spatial tests that measured subjects\u2019 ability to recall the location of items in a complex array or objects in a room, they found that women indeed consistently recalled more objects than men did, and recalled their location more accurately.\nDavid Buss has argued that there are major differences between males and females regarding mate choice and jealousy that are evolved responses to different selection pressures (see, for example, Buss 1992, 1994, 2000; Buss and Schmitt 1993). For instance, he reasoned that because men need to guard against cuckoldry, while women need to guard against losing their mate\u2019s economic resources, men should be concerned more by signs of sexual infidelity than about the loss of their partner\u2019s emotional attachment, while women should be troubled more by cues that signal emotional infidelity than by signs of sexual infidelity. Buss et al. (1992) asked males and females from the USA, Europe and Asia whether they would be more distressed by sexual or emotional infidelity:\nPlease think of a serious committed romantic relationship that you have had in the past, that you currently have, or that you would like to have. Imagine that you discover that the person with whom you\u2019ve been seriously involved became interested in someone else. What would distress or upset you more (please circle only one):\n(A) Imagining your partner forming a deep emotional attachment to that person.\n(B) Imagining your partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with that other person.\n(Buss et al. 1992, 252)\nNowhere did women report sexual infidelity to be more upsetting than men, and on average, 51% of the men, but only 22% of the women chose option B above (for data and critical discussion, see Buller 2005, 316\u201345). These results have been taken to confirm Buss\u2019 evolutionary hypothesis about sex differences with regard to jealousy (for a dissenting view see, for example, DeSteno and Salovey 1996; Harris and Christenfeld 1996).\nThe flagship example of Evolutionary Psychology is still Cosmides and Tooby\u2019s work on cheater detection. In the 1960s, the Swedish psychologist Peter Wason devised the so-called \u201cWason Selection Task\u201d in order to investigate how good subjects are at checking conditional rules (Wason 1966). He gave subjects a rule of the form \u201cIf P, then Q\u201d (for example, \u201cIf a person goes to Boston, then that person takes the subway\u201d), and showed them four cards. Two of the cards exemplified the P- and not-P-option, respectively (for example, \u201cBoston\u201d and \u201cNew York\u201d), and two of them exemplified the Q and not-Q-option, respectively (for example, \u201csubway\u201d and \u201ccab\u201d). The subjects were told that the unseen sides of the P and not-P-cards could contain an instance of either Q or not-Q, and vice versa, and that they should indicate all and only the cards that would definitely have to be turned over in order to determine whether they violated the rule. Since a material conditional is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false, the logically correct response would be to pick the P- and the not-Q-card. However, Wason discovered that most subjects choose either only the P-card or the P- and the Q-card, while few choose the P- and the not-Q-card. More importantly, subjects\u2019 performance was apparently influenced by the content of the rules. While 48% correctly solved the Boston/transportation problem, successful performance dropped to less then 25% for the rule \u201cIf a person has a \u2018D\u2019 rating, then his documents must be marked code \u20193\u2032\u201d (with the options \u2018D\u2019, \u2018F\u2019, \u20193\u2032, \u20197\u2032), and increased to nearly 75% for the rule \u201cIf a person is drinking beer, then he must be over 21 years old\u201d (with the options \u201cdrinking beer,\u201d \u201cdrinking coke,\u201d \u201c25 years old,\u201d \u201c16 years old\u201d) (Cosmides and Tooby 1992, 182\u20133). By the 1980s, the psychological literature was full with reports of such \u201ccontent effects,\u201d but there was no satisfying theory to explain them.\nEvolutionary biologists had long been puzzled by our ability to engage in altruistic behavior\u2014behavior an individual A performs for the benefit of another individual B, associated with some significant cost for A (like warning calls, help in raising offspring, saving a drowning child, and so forth). How could a tendency to behave in a way that increases another individual\u2019s fitness at some non-negligible cost to oneself be produced and retained by natural selection? Robert Trivers (1971) argued that altruistic behavior can evolve if it is reciprocal, that is, if A\u2018s act a has benefit bB for B and cost cA for A, B reciprocates with some act a* with benefit bA for A and cost cB for B, where bA outweighs cA and bB outweighs cB. Interactions that satisfy this cost-benefit structure constitute what is called a \u201csocial exchange.\u201d Since in social exchanges both A and B incur a net-benefit, Trivers reasoned, altruistic behavior can evolve. Yet, the problem is that once a propensity for altruistic behavior has evolved, it is obviously better for an individual to cheat by accepting the benefit of an altruistic act without paying the cost of reciprocation. In the long run, this would lead to an increase in the number of cheaters until altruism was driven to extinction. In order for altruism to evolve, Trivers (1971, 48) concluded, natural selection must \u201cfavor more acute abilities to detect cheating.\u201d\nCosmides and Tooby saw a connection between the need to detect cheaters in acts of social exchange and the content effect discovered by Wason (Cosmides 1989; Cosmides and Tooby 1989, 1992). Since the ability to test abstract logical rules would not have had any adaptive value in the EEA, we should not expect natural selection to have endowed the human mind with some general conditional reasoning capacity. Rather, natural selection should have designed a module that allows us to detect those who accept the benefit without reciprocating accordingly in situations of social exchange. Consequently, we should be better at testing social contract rules that say \u201cIf person A provides the requested benefit to or meets the requirement of person or group B, then B will provide the rationed benefit to A\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 2000, 1260) than at testing conditional rules that do not describe such conditions.\nWhen Cosmides and Tooby categorized \u201ccontent effects according to whether they conformed to social contracts, a striking pattern emerged. Robust and replicable content effects were found only for rules that related terms that are recognizable as benefits and cost/requirements in the format of a standard social contract\u201d (Cosmides and Tooby 1992, 183). They argued that the content effect found in Wason Selection Tasks is due to the fact that some tasks involve a social contract rule.\nIn order to substantiate this hypothesis, they conducted a series of experiments designed to rule out alternative explanations of the content effects. One plausible explanation, for instance, would be that our cognitive system is able to deal better and more effectively with familiar problems (like the drinking/age problem) than with unfamiliar problems (like the letter/number problem). They therefore compared performance on unfamiliar social rules with performance on unfamiliar non-social rules. If familiarity is the issue, then subjects should perform equally bad on both unfamiliar rules. If, however, the increased performance in the drinking/age problem is due to the fact that here the subjects are dealing with a social contract rule, then performance should be better on the unfamiliar social than on the unfamiliar non-social rule.\nCosmides designed two unfamiliar Wason Selection Tasks. One rule read \u201cIf a man eats cassava root, then he must have a tattoo on his face\u201d (with the options \u201ceats cassava root,\u201d \u201ceats molo nuts,\u201d \u201ctattoo,\u201d \u201cno tattoo\u201d). The other read \u201cIf you eat duiker meat, then you have found an ostrich eggshell\u201d (with the options \u201cduiker,\u201d \u201cweasel,\u201d \u201costrich eggshell,\u201d \u201cquail eggshell\u201d). The first was accompanied by a story according to which the inhabitants of a Polynesian island have strict sexual mores that prohibit sex between unmarried people and thus mark married men with a facial tattoo and do not permit unmarried men to eat cassava root, which is a very powerful aphrodisiac. The second story said that anthropologists who notice that the natives frequently say that if someone eats duiker meat, then he has found an ostrich shell hypothesize that this is because duikers often feed on ostrich shells. Thus, the first rule clearly represents a social contract\u2014having a tattoo is the requirement one has to meet if one is being permitted the benefit of eating cassava root\u2014while the second is a non-social rule which simply expresses the hypothesis that duikers and ostrich eggs are frequently found in close proximity.\nThe results confirmed the cheater detection prediction (Cosmides and Tooby 1992, 186\u20137): 75% correctly answered the unfamiliar social problem, but only 21% the unfamiliar non-social problem.\nCosmides also hypothesized that if there is a cheater detection module, then subjects should pick the cards that represent cheating even if they correspond to the logically incorrect answer. She thus switched the logical role of the P/not-P- and the Q/not-Q-cards in both the cassava root/tattoo and the duiker meat/ostrich shell problem. The switched rules read \u201cIf a man has a tattoo on his face, then he eats cassava root\u201d and \u201cIf you have found an ostrich eggshell, then you eat duiker meat.\u201d Since the not-P- and the Q-card (\u201cno tattoo\u201d and \u201ceats cassava root\u201d) still represent accepting a benefit without meeting the requirement, the cheater detection hypothesis predicts that subjects should pick the logically incorrect cards in the first case, whereas performance in the ostrich shell/duiker meat case should be unaffected. Again, the prediction was confirmed (Cosmides and Tooby 1992, 188\u20139): 67% of the subjects chose the logically incorrect not-P- and Q-cards in response to the switched social problem, but only 4% did so for the switched non-social problem. (For a criticism of Cosmides and Tooby\u2019s work on cheater detection and for further references see Buller 2005, 163\u201390.)\n4. Problems and Objections\nEvolutionary Psychology is a successful research program, but it has its problems. Some difficulties have already been mentioned in section 2 in connection with the theoretical underpinnings of Evolutionary Psychology (for a recent critique of Evolutionary Psychology at a methodological and conceptual level see Panksepp and Panksepp 2000). These and a couple of others will be briefly reviewed in this section.\na. Genetic Determinism\nOne of the most often heard criticisms is also one of the least convincing. The charge is that Evolutionary Psychology is committed to, or at least willfully embraces, a genetic determinism according to which our behavior is determined by our genetic make-up, which, since it is a human universal, cannot be influenced by means of social learning, education, and so forth, Dorothy Nelkin (2000, 27), for instance, claims that Evolutionary Psychology implies \u201cgenetic destiny,\u201d and Robin Dunbar maintains that it seems \u201cto be looking for genetically determined characters that are universally valid for all humans,\u201d observing that this makes little sense because the \u201cnumber of genuinely universal traits are \u2026 likely to run to single figures at most\u201d (Dunbar 1988, 168).\nIt is true that Evolutionary Psychologists are looking for human universals, and it is also true that they think that if humans were not genetically very similar, there could be no cognitive adaptations (see section 2e ). Yet, they are not committed to \u201ca form of \u2018genetic determinism,\u2019 if by that one means the idea that genes determine everything, immune from an environmental influence\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1990a, 19). Their claim is that the cognitive mechanisms underlying behavior are human universals, and that does not entail that our behavior is genetically determined, or the same all over the world. Quite the contrary: It is universally agreed among Evolutionary Psychologists that behavior, like any other human trait, is the result of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic determinism is false because \u201cevery feature of every phenotype is fully and equally codetermined by the interaction of the organism\u2019s genes \u2026 and its ontogenetic environments\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 1992, 83; italics added), as is nicely illustrated by the fact that not even genetic clones, monozygotic twins, are phenotypically identical. In fact, work in Evolutionary Psychology has emphasized the highly flexible and contingent nature of cognitive adaptations. For instance, Martin Daly and Margo Wilson\u2019s often cited work on violence toward children by stepparents (for example, Daly and Wilson 1988a, 1988b) is in fact entirely concerned with contextual factors\u2014the presence of a stepparent in a household, they argue, is one of the primary predictors of fatal violence toward children.\nb. Moral and Societal Issues\nA related charge is that Evolutionary Psychology is defending the status quo regarding sex, race, intelligence differences, and so forth, by arguing that, first, there is nothing we can do, given that these differences are the result of our hard-wired cognitive mechanisms, and, second, there is no need to do something, because these differences, being the result of natural selection, are optimal solutions to longstanding adaptive problems.\nThe first claim is just wrong. As seen in section 4a , it is not \u201call in our genes\u201d because the environment heavily influences what behavior issues forth from cognitive mechanisms, even if the latter are evolutionarily hard-wired.\nThe second claim is an instance of what many scholars would regard as the fallacious inference from \u201cis\u201d to \u201cought\u201d (see Naturalistic Fallacy ). As Robert Kurzban (2002) has pointed out, Evolutionary Psychologists are well aware that it is illegitimate to move from the first to the second, that there is a difference \u201cbetween science, which can help us to understand what is, and morality, which concerns questions about what ought to be.\u201d Regarding cognitive adaptations, one cannot infer \u201cought\u201d from \u201cis\u201d because (1) there is no guarantee that natural selection always finds an optimal solution, (2) since the environment has changed, something that was good for our ancestors may no longer be good for us, and (3) the sense in which it was \u201cgood\u201d for our ancestors that, say, they possessed a cognitive mechanism that pre-disposed them to kill children of their mating partners that were not their own (\u201cgood\u201d in the sense of \u201cfitness increasing\u201d) is definitely not the sense of \u201cgood\u201d that is relevant to ethical discourse (\u201cgood\u201d in the sense of \u201cmorally praiseworthy/obligatory\u201d).\nc. Untestability and Story Telling\nOne of the key problems for Evolutionary Psychologists is to show that the adaptationist explanations they offer are indeed explanations properly so called and not mere \u201cjust-so-stories\u201d that feature plausible scenarios without its being certain that they are historical fact. Stephen Jay Gould, for instance, who famously criticized evolutionary biology for its unreflected and widespread adaptationism that tends to ignore other plausible evolutionary explanations (Gould and Lewontin 1979), has argued that the sole task of Evolutionary Psychology has become \u201ca speculative search for reasons why a behavior that harms us now must once have originated for adaptive purposes\u201d (Gould 2000, 119).\nThere is something to this charge, but things are more difficult. Evolutionary Psychologists stress that \u201c[i]t is difficult to reconcile such claims with the actual practice of EP, since in evolutionary psychology the evolutionary model or prediction typically precedes and causes the discovery of new facts, rather than being constructed post hoc to fit some known fact\u201d (Sell et al. 2003, 52). The discussion of functional analysis in section 2b has shown that there is a clear sense in which adaptationist hypotheses can be tested: functional analysis predicts the existence of yet unknown cognitive mechanisms on the grounds of evolutionary reasoning about potential adaptive problems in the EEA, and these predictions are then empirically tested. The hypotheses Evolutionary Psychologists derive from their computational theory thus allow them \u201cto devise experiments that make possible the detection and mapping of mechanisms that no one would otherwise have thought to test for in the absence of such theories\u201d (Sell et al. 2003, 48). It is therefore not true that \u201cclaims about an EEA usually cannot be tested in principle but only subjected to speculation\u201d (Gould 1997, 51) because if the purported cognitive mechanisms fail to show up in psychological experiments, the adapationist explanation is falsified.\nFirst, however, this holds only for research that conforms to Cosmides and Tooby\u2019s theoretical model (arguably, Cosmides and Tooby\u2019s work on cheater detection, Buss\u2019 work on sex differences with regard to jealousy, and Silverman and Eals\u2019 work on differences in spatial abilities belong to this category). It does not apply to research that does not generate a prediction based on a putative problem, but tries to infer the historical function of an organism\u2019s traits from its current structure. Profet\u2019s work on pregnancy sickness would be a case in point: here, one already knows the trait (pregnancy sickness) and merely speculates about its historic function, in contrast to the other cases, where the existence of the trait (an ability to detect cheaters, sex specific responses to jealousy, or sex specific spatial abilities) is inferred from evolutionary considerations about the problems prevalent in the EEA.\nSecond, the controversial claim is not that our psychological faculties have evolved. It is that they are adaptations, and, more specifically, adaptations for solving particular adaptive problems. Successful psychological tests that show that current Homo sapiens indeed possesses the hypothesized cognitive mechanisms establish that these traits have evolved, but they fail to establish that they are adaptations, let alone adaptations for, say, detecting cheaters or remembering the location of edible plants. For all these tests tell us, the traits in question could still be exaptations, or even spandrels. In order to show that they are indeed adaptations, a point that is forcefully made by Richardson (2008), additional information would be needed, and it is not clear that this additional information can be had (for a sketch of Richardson\u2019s argument see Walter 2009).\nThird, there seems to be a sense in which adaptationist explanations are still \u201cjust-so-stories.\u201d Functional analysis relies on claims about the nature of the EEA which cannot be directly verified because there is very little we can know with any confidence about the conditions that obtained in the EEA. As Evolutionary Psychologists like to point out, there are some things which have arguably stayed constant since the EEA:\n[R]esearchers know with certainty of high confidence thousands of important things about our ancestors, many of which can be used to derive falsifiable predictions about our psychological architecture: our ancestors had two sexes; contracted infections by contact, collected plant foods; inhabited a world where the motions of objects conformed to the principles of kinematic geometry; had color vision; were predated upon; had faces; lived in a biotic environment with a hierarchical taxonomic structure, and so forth (Sell et al. 2003, 52\u20133).\nThe problem is that knowing that our ancestors inhabited a world with two sexes where the motions of objects conformed to the principles of kinematic geometry does not enable us to formulate the adaptive problems our ancestors putatively faced in enough detail. Both our male and female ancestors lived in such a world (as, by the way, did the ancestors of apes, spiders and flies), and yet they evolved different mating strategies, different responses to emotional versus sexual infidelity, different spatial abilities, and so forth. The descriptions of the past adaptive problems that Evolutionary Psychologists rely on in order to explain these differences are much more specific than the platitudes of which we can be relatively certain, and it is unclear how we could ever be confident that we got the specific details right. As Stephen Jay Gould puts it vividly:\nBut how can we possibly know in detail what small bands of hunter-gatherers did in Africa two million years ago? These ancestors left some tools and bones, and paleoanthropologists can make some ingenious inferences from such evidence. But how can we possibly obtain the key information that would be required to show the validity of adaptive tales about an EEA: relations of kinship, social structures and sizes of groups, different activities of males and females, the roles of religion, symbolizing, storytelling, and a hundred other central aspects of human life that cannot be traced in fossils? (Gould 1997, \u00a731; see also Gould 2000, 120)\nIn the case of Buss\u2019 research on the evolution of sex differences with regard to jealousy, for instance, we can only hypothesize about such things as group structure and size, mating structures, similarities between ancestral and current group structures, or the alleged differences in mating behavior in ancestral groups that are appealed to or presupposed in the formulation of the adaptive problem (again, a point made convincingly by Richardson 2008).\nOf course, as Sell et al. (2003) point out, if our assumptions about our ancestors\u2019 problems are wrong, our computational theory is wrong, too, and should thus predict the existence of cognitive mechanisms that will not be found when checked for empirically. Yet, even if this is so, the two qualifications above apply to this move mutatis mutandis. (For more on the role of historical evidence in the search for adaptations and the kinds of problems that may arise, see Kaplan 2002.)\nd. Psychological Inadequacy\nIn Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature, David Buller argues \u201cnot only that the theoretical and methodological doctrines of Evolutionary Psychology are problematic, but that Evolutionary Psychology has not, in fact, produced any solid empirical results\u201d (Buller 2005, 15). What is wrong with Evolutionary Psychology is that the psychological experiments used to establish the existence of the hypothesized cognitive mechanisms in current Homo sapiens are flawed because the data are exiguous, inconclusive and do not support the claims made by Evolutionary Psychologists, as Buller tries to show in detail for the classical studies of Cosmides and Tooby, Buss, and Daly and Wilson on cheater detection, mating strategies, jealousy, and discriminative parenthood. Whereas Richardson (2008) claims that Evolutionary Psychology is problematic as Evolutionary Psychology, Buller challenges the psychological credentials of evolutionary psychology, arguing that Evolutionary Psychology fails as Evolutionary Psychology.\n5. Evolutionary Approaches to Mind, Culture, and Behavior: Alternatives to Evolutionary Psychology\nIn its broad sense, evolutionary psychology attempts to adopt \u201can evolutionary perspective on human behavior and psychology\u201d (Barrett et al. 2002, 1) by applying Darwinian reasoning to behavioral, cognitive, social, or cultural characteristics of humans. Evolutionary Psychology is one strand of evolutionary psychology, but there are others, and the literature is full of different labels: \u201csociobiology,\u201d \u201cevolutionary anthropology,\u201d \u201chuman behavioral ecology,\u201d \u201cDarwinian psychology,\u201d \u201cgene-culture coevolution,\u201d to name just a few. These approaches share the idea that evolutionary reasoning can enhance our understanding of mind, culture, and society, but they disagree about exactly how Darwinian thinking ought to enter the picture. This is not the place to go into the details, but a brief survey of the theoretical landscape (see Laland and Brown 2002 for a book-length overview) may help to understand the difference between evolutionary psychology as a general field of inquiry and Evolutionary Psychology as a narrowly circumscribed research paradigm.\na. Human Behavioral Ecology\nEvolutionary Psychologists insist that an evolutionary approach to human psychology must ask whether a trait is an adaptation, not whether it is currently adaptive. They thereby separate themselves sharply from an approach Symons (1989) dubbed \u201cDarwinian anthropology\u201d that instead focuses on the current adaptiveness of our behavior (for a more reconciliatory approach see, for example, Downes 2001). Human behavioral ecology, as it is nowadays called (Borgerhoff Mulder 1991), originated in the late 1970s when, after the upheaval caused by Wilson\u2019s Sociobiology, some anthropologists decided to go out and test the controversial hypotheses of Wilson and others by means of real data from hunter-gatherer populations (Chagnon and Irons 1979; Hinde 1974). Using quantitative ethnographic information and optimality models, human behavioral ecologists investigate whether and how the current adaptiveness of an individual\u2019s behavior is influenced by its ecological and cultural environment and in which way the different behaviors individuals develop to cope with environmental challenges lead to and account for cultural differences between them.\nNatural selection, human behavioral ecologists argue, has created an extraordinary flexibility\u2014known as phenotypic plasticity\u2014that allows our \u201cbehavior to assume the form that maximizes inclusive fitness\u201d (Irons 1979, 33) across a wide variety of widely diverse habitats. Since there has been selection for a general phenotypic plasticity, we are not so much \u201cadaptation executers\u201d as rather \u201cfitness maximizers\u201d: \u201cModern Darwinian theory predicts that human behavior will be \u2026 designed to promote maximum reproductive success\u201d (Turke and Betzig 1985, 79; italics added). As a consequence, human behavioral ecologists are less interested in discovering proximal cognitive mechanisms than in checking whether the behavior they trigger is actually adaptive (a strategy known as phenotypic gambit).\nb. Memetics\nA rather different approach is adopted by memetics (Blackmore 1999; Distin 2005). Memetics tries to explain cultural characteristics and processes and the way they influence our behavior by postulating a process of cultural evolution that is analogous to the process of biological evolution, but largely independent of it. Dawkins (1976) introduced the idea that evolution by natural selection is a substrate neutral process that can act on what he called a \u201creplicator,\u201d that is, any heritable entity for which there is variation in a population and that is associated with different degrees of fitness. The gene, Dawkins said, is the replicator in biological evolution, but the cultural realm also has a replicator, which he famously dubbed a meme: a meme is \u201ca unit of cultural inheritance, hypothesized as analogous to the particulate gene, and as naturally selected in virtue of its phenotypic consequences on its own survival and replication in the cultural environment\u201d (Dawkins 1982, 290). Memes form the substrate of cultural evolution, a process in which different memes are differentially transmitted from individual to individual. One of the key challenges for memetics is to spell out exactly what memes are, and although suggestions abound, there is no agreed consensus [for instance, according to Dawkins \"examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches\" (Dawkins 1976, 206), while Dennett (1995, 347\u20138) cites the ideas of the wheel, of wearing clothes, the vendetta, the right triangle, the alphabet, chess, perspective drawing, Impressionism, Greensleeves, and deconstructionism as examples]. Importantly, whatever memes are, they must be sufficiently similar to genes to warrant the claim that cultural evolution is more or less analogous to biological evolution, and critics of memetics argue that this constraint is unlikely to be met (for example, Boyd and Richerson 2000; for a more optimistic view, see Blackmore 1999, ch. 5).\nc. Gene-Culture Coevolution\nDefenders of what is known as \u201cgene-culture coevolution\u201d or \u201cdual inheritance theory\u201d (Boyd and Richerson 1985, 2005a, 2005b; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldmann 1981; Durham 1991) agree with memetics that transmitted cultural information is too important a factor to be ignored by an evolutionary approach to human culture and behavior. After all, one of the most striking facts about humans is that there are important and persistent differences between human groups that are due to culturally transmitted ideas, and not to genetic, biological, or ecological factors. Yet, although culture is a Darwinian force in its own right, they argue, there is no substantial analogy between cultural and biological evolution. In both processes information is transmitted between individuals and both create patterns of heritable variation, but the differences are much more salient: culture is not based on direct replication but upon teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning, the transmission of culture is temporally extended and not restricted to parents and their offspring, cultural evolution is not necessarily particulate, and not necessarily random (Boyd and Richerson 2000).\nCulture is part of human biology, gene-culture coevolutionists argue, but accounts concerned solely with genetic factors are inadequate because they ignore the fact that culture itself shapes the adaptive environment in which biological evolution takes place by creating a culturally constructed environment in which human genes must evolve. Conversely, accounts aimed solely at explaining cultural replication are also inadequate because they ignore the fact that genes affect cultural evolution, for instance by forming psychological predispositions that bias what people imitate, teach, or are able to learn. Hence, a truly evolutionary approach to culture must acknowledge that genesand culture coevolve, and try to investigate the circumstances under which the cultural habits adopted by individuals are influenced by their genes, and how the natural selection pressures that guide biological evolution may be generated by culture.\n6.

Lastly, your general <em>psychology</em> text provides a good overview of many issues <em>in</em> <em>psychology</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Henry Whittemore Library\nGetting Organized\nThere are many things students can do while still in school that will make life after college easier. Until it's upon them, many students don't realize how stressful finishing college can be. Completing that 32nd course means more than an end to tests, papers, professors, and so forth. For most graduates, it also means the beginning of many other more serious responsibilities - employment applications and interviews, full-time jobs, reduced or no more reliance on mom and dad, college bills to repay, less time to \"play\" with friends, and so forth. Waiting to plan for these events can make the last semester all the more stressful. Although some aspects can't be dealt with early, a few can. Preparing may help reduce anxieties and, hopefully, enable students to secure the jobs they want.\nWhat should I keep as I go through college and after?\nFor the most part, once you complete a course, you probably won't need the textbook again. Texts become out-dated very quickly. If it's worth it to you, sell the book to another student or back to the bookstore. Unfortunately, used textbooks, no matter what the condition, don't command high returns.\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule, however. Psychology majors may want to hold onto texts they feel are in an area of study they enjoy and may pursue later. A familiar text to refer to can speed the finding of information later on. Your APA writing manual is a keeper. Students are likely to refer to this every semester, as well as after graduation should they have a writing assignment. Lastly, your general psychology text provides a good overview of many issues in psychology. Reviewing this text is step one of preparing for the psychology subject test of the GRE's.\nDo I need to keep any course materials?\nYes. There are a few important things to keep. It is recommended that on a semesterly basis, students file away important papers in a notebook or storage box. Many of your professors still have a box or two of old course materials from their own school days. Course materials to consider keeping:\nCollege Catalog: Students must meet the college and major requirements specified in the catalog of the year in which they enrolled. It is the students' responsibility to know these requirements and to inform their advisors should misinformation be provided due to college or departmental changes. Additionally, should a student opt to transfer to another institution, the personnel of that new college may ask to see the catalog or parts of it.\nCourse Syllabi: Course descriptions within college catalogs are deliberately brief and vague. The description allows students to get an idea of what the course will entail as far as content, but without specifics. The instructor then has a fair amount of liberty in structuring the course specifics.\nTransferring: When transferring, it is not unusual for copies of syllabi to be requested. Only by looking at the actual syllabi can registrars or department chairs determine if new students have met prerequisites and such. Most faculty members do not store old syllabi - hardcopy or on computer. Do not expect to be able to request one years or even semesters after completing a course.\nPapers: Though most student papers can be tossed, wise students will hold onto a few that received high grades or are particularly good examples of their writing ability. Sometimes when applying for jobs and often in completing graduate school applications, a writing sample is requested. Providing a paper previously read and edited by an instructor is a better hedge toward success than a spur-of-the-moment paper! In fact, it is strongly recommended that majors revise their experimental papers after the semester. Though this revision will not be graded, someday you may be very happy you took the extra time. This is often a paper worked on for two semesters and that has been revised 6-8 times. Set a post-experimental date by which the final revisions will be made and no excuses for not getting it done!!! If students feel their experimental instructors may not give full attention to a paper that will never be touched again by the student, they should let the instructor know in advance of their intent to revise. Ask for a thorough critique, even if it might mean tougher grading as every flaw is noted!\nNotes: If students have taken courses that may relate to their future employment positions, lecture notes and class activity sheets may come in handy. As an employee, you may be asked to take the lead in a staff meeting. As a graduate student, it is likely that you will be offered a teaching assistantship. As a TA, you will be presenting lectures or conducting recitations (discussions). Though your old notes may not be exactly what you need to do the job, they will provide a start.\n"}, {"score": 1203.2867, "uuid": "df8f437c-e5c3-5bad-be2c-f4f8c342b2c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0818wb-23-29830", "target_hostname": "experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2006/03/experimental_ph.html", "page_rank": 1.1797111e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Experimental <em>Philosophy</em>: Experimental <em>Philosophy</em> <em>in</em> Slate", "snippet": "But the really big deal is &quot;empirically informed <em>philosophy</em>&quot;.

Junior Year: Brainstorm Topic Areas.\nYou want a topic that will sustain your interest for a year and that is sufficiently focused that you can work productively. At this stage, focus on what interests you.\n(2) Second Semester, Junior Year\n(A) Find a Primary Adviser.\nYour Primary Advisor will be your chief contact on the thesis. It might help to consult the list of faculty advisors , but note that the list is partial and incomplete. Your Advisor should be someone you're comfortable working with, someone who shares your interest in your topic; but must be a faculty member (e.g. no lab managers) If you find a potential adviser not in our list, please contact the PNP Administrator .\nUndertaking an Honors Thesis is a serious commitment. Your interest in your chosen topic must be supported by self-discipline, organizational skills, and a willingness to work independently. For the benefit of both student and Advisor, we ask that students follow PNP policies closely.\nIf you are studying abroad during the Junior year, it is vital to plan ahead carefully. If possible, you should secure the agreement of a Primary Advisor prior to departure.\nYour committee members--your Primary Advisor and a Secondary Advisor assigned by PNP--must agree to be available the week after Spring break or willing to schedule a defense before then.\n(B) Develop a Topic\nAn Honors Thesis might be predominantly theoretical, or it might involve a substantial empirical component, but it should have more of an interdisciplinary focus than an Honors Thesis in Philosophy, Psychology, or another of the component disciplines. A PNP Honors Thesis would normally be 30-60 pages, divided into chapters, although theses that are more empirical in their orientation may take a different form.\nDo I need funding?\nYou should talk with your Primary Adviser about whether you will be required to acquire funding for your project, and, if so, what funding resources might be open to you. The Office of Undergraduate Research can be helpful in this regard as well.\nWhat if my project involves human subjects?\nIf your Thesis involves human participants, you will need to obtain prior authorization from the Human Research Protection Office . You are urged to plan ahead and factor in the significant lead time this process involves. You will need to take a brief Human Subject Education course, submit a complete description of your experiment, and await approval before you can begin collecting your data. This process can easily take two months or longer, especially if revisions are requested.\nDo not assume that you do not need to get permission even if your Advisor tells you it is unimportant. Washington University policy is clear on this: students who do not follow these procedures \"will not be allowed to use the data in an Honors Thesis, presentation, or publication of any sort. Blatant violations may be referred to WU academic integrity or research integrity review boards.\"\nFAQ for Undergraduate Research Projects.\nFaculty in the Medical School and the Psychology Department are typically well versed in these procedures and might be able to give you some guidance on filling out and submitting these forms.\n(3) Prior to Last Day of Classes, Junior Year: Apply for Honors\nComplete an Application (link at bottom of page) for the PNP Senior Honors program.\u00a0 Include a succinct summary of your thesis project, specifying the general topic area in which you plan to write your thesis. Have this approved by your thesis advisor and the PNP Administrator . Return your application to Kimberly Mount in the PNP office, Wilson 208.\n(4) Registration Junior Year: Register for PNP 499 Study for Honors Thesis\nPrimary Advisors must contact the PNP Administrative Assistant to register for PNP 499.\n(5) Monday of Second Week of Fall Semester: Thesis Abstract and Bibliography\nOn the Monday of the second full week of Fall Semester classes, you must submit a Thesis abstract. Think of the abstract as a 500-1000 word update and revision of the summary from the summer--see item (3), above. An abstract defines the area of study and a means of approaching the area of study.\nIn consultation with your Primary and Secondary Advisors, you will also produce a bibliography for the topic area, identifying a selection of books and articles to be read over the course of the semester. Think of the bibliographic project as part of learning the 'lay of the land' in a given topic area. The abstract and bibliography must be approved by both advisors.\nHelpful Hint: students will find the PNP-specific online search services , and the PNP librarian, Melissa Vetter , most helpful at this stage.\n(6) Early in the Fall Semester\nYou will need to identify a secondary adviser.\u00a0 Remember that at least one of the two committee members must be a core PNP faculty member.\u00a0 If you have a preference for a secondary adviser, please notify Kimberly Mount .\u00a0 If you do not have a preference, a secondary adviser will be assigned to you by the honors director.\n(7) End of Fall Semester: Mid-Project Review\nBy the end of the first semester of your senior year, you are expected to be approaching a complete first draft of your thesis. This means, at a minimum, that:\n(a) you have a complete outline of the thesis\n(b) you a complete draft of at least one half of the honors thesis\n(c) you have a summary making clear how the thesis will unfold over the Spring Semester\nThese milestones are necessary to ensure that you are able to meet the strict week-after-spring-break deadline for completion of the thesis in the Spring semester. Failing to carry through on (a)-(c) will make you ineligible to enroll in Honors for the Spring Semester.\nIf your Primary Advisor determines that you work is satisfactory (worthy of a grade of at least a B-), the Advisor should then contact the PNP Administrator indicating that you are on track for completion, and providing a grade. The Administrator will see that grade is assigned for the Fall Semester of PNP 499, and that continuation for the spring semester is approved.\nIf you fall short of a B-, the Thesis Committee will terminate the Thesis Project, and, once your Primary Advisor notifies the PNP Administrator , you will be assigned a grade for PNP 500: Independent Study.\n(8) Spring of Senior Year: Undergraduate Research Symposium\nWe strongly encourage students to present their Thesis in a 'poster' at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium\n(9) Friday of the Sixth Week of the Spring Semester: Complete Thesis Draft.\nAt the end of the sixth week of the semester, a complete draft of your Honors Thesis must be in the hands of your Thesis Committee. The Committee for the thesis comprises your Primary and Secondary Advisors. Your Advisors are encouraged to return the draft with comments as quickly as possible. Your Thesis defense should be scheduled as soon as your Primary Advisor approves the thesis for defense. Advisors: please note time constraints in (9) and (10), and the defense deadline in (11).\n(10) Friday Before Spring Break: Final Draft\nOn the Friday before Spring Break, you should supply a copy of the thesis to each of your Committee members.\n(11) Defense\nYour thesis defense must be held by the end of the first week after Spring Break.\n*Notification and Approval of defense date must be made through the PNP office .\nExpect your defense to last about an hour. You will be asked to deliver a brief overview of the thesis, then face questioning from the committee. At the conclusion, you will be asked to leave the room, and the Thesis Committee determines both a grade for the thesis and a recommendation as to the level of Latin Honors. When you return, you will be informed of the result.

I\u2019ve talked about the benefits of completing a Philosophy major (Bachelor of Arts degree) in detail . However, the prospective Philosophy major should also be forewarned in terms of:\n- You will need plenty of self discipline to distil the real gold nuggets from a philosophy major; viz, critical thinking skills and ability to clearly write and communicate.\n- No one is going to hand you a job after you graduate with your degree and\u00a0you will need to work extra hard to turn the skills you learned as a Philosophy major into practical, applicable, knowledge that translates well within the marketplace (sorry, this is just a reality).\n- You may need a professional degree if you can\u2019t apply skills learned as an undergraduate into a job category that is in demand. \u00a0That is to say, you may need to quickly aquire an MBA, JD, or other professional degree to get a job. \u00a0I graduated from University in the late 1990\u2032s and the .com boom was underway and many jobs were available (this is currently not the case in the US) and I had a practical skill set thanks to work-study position I held for a number of years.\n3.\u00a0Has Your Philosophy degree ever been a burden?\nI think the only time I\u2019ve felt negative about studying Philosophy as an undergraduate was during my first two years at University. \u00a0Studying Philosophy comes with lots of criticism from peers, parents, professors, etc. and it\u2019s especially tough to ignore the negative comments when you\u2019re still new to campus and college life, in general. \u00a0A typical scenario is your Engineering major roommate constantly bombarding you with questions on why you\u2019re wasting your time studying something so obtuse and unimportant (be ready with thick skin and a couple of good arguments).\n4.\u00a0I recommend doing a full Philosophy major because only then will you get to take some intense seminar level classes on specific philosophers and topics. \u00a0You may even become interested in some specific aspect of Philosophy (such as Philosophy of Mind) and may want to write a senior thesis (this is great practice for the real world in terms of thinking through an idea, justifying the idea, and thereafter defending the premise of your argument). \u00a0In addition to my Philosophy major I have two minors in Linguistics and Psychology. \u00a0Looking back, I may have opted for a dual major in Philosophy and Economics.\n"}, {"score": 1189.776, "uuid": "e5334790-3126-5609-8fc5-9ce4ff276191", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0710wb-73-29025", "target_hostname": "mycoursecalendar.lakeheadu.ca", "target_uri": "http://mycoursecalendar.lakeheadu.ca/previouscals/2008-2009/programs/Faculty_of_SocSci_%26_Humanities/philprog.html", "page_rank": 1.267074e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Philosophy</em> Programs", "snippet": "Students planning to combine a minor <em>in</em> Professional Ethics with a <em>major</em> <em>in</em> <em>Philosophy</em> <em>should</em> be aware that only <em>Philosophy</em> 1100 may be double credited toward the <em>Philosophy</em> component of the <em>major</em>.

Working while enrolled in college full-time is not recommended. To get the most out of your education, you will need time to study, to participate in extra-curricular activities, and to take advantage of opportunities available only to students.\u00a0 Every student should be thinking about activities that will impress future employers or graduate school committees, as well as enhance skills and knowledge.\u00a0 Typically, it is not student-level employment positions that impress future employers.\u00a0 What employers and graduate committee members look for are internships, specialty courses, participation in the campus community (e.g., student government, leadership roles, etc) and evidence of academic achievement over and above a GPA (e.g., honor societies and memberships, pre-professional memberships, awards, conferences, etc.).\u00a0 Engaging in such activities and doing well requires time and flexible scheduling.\u00a0 Attending classes and just getting by with studies so that work hours may be met is far from the ideal.\u00a0 It also leaves your reference writers with little to write about and few means to really get to know you and your potential.\nWhat if I have to work in order to afford college? You are not alone.\u00a0 College is a choice and so sometimes compromises must be made.\u00a0 Being a college student is a full-time \"job.\"\u00a0 Students need to realize that they are investing time and money in their future earning potentials and job satisfaction.\u00a0 Doing well these 4 years will greatly impact students' futures.\u00a0 Going to college may mean applying for loans, grants or work-study, borrowing from family members, giving up luxuries like a new car, electronic devices and being \"poor.\"\u00a0 But it is temporary student poverty level!\u00a0 If you must work, work as few hours as possible and not more than 15 per week.\u00a0 If you must work full-time or nearly full-time, consider enrolling in the evening program (DGCE) or go part-time which is one or two courses a semester.\u00a0 This may simply not be the time for college for you.\nWhat if I pay for all my college expenses by credit card. Is that a good idea? Absolutely not!\u00a0 Credit card interest rates are very high and late fees add on quickly!\u00a0 Use of credit cards for more than you can pay off by the end of the month is an easy way to get into debt you may never escape from!\u00a0 You do not want to work just to pay off credit cards or to graduate with credit debt with no end in sight!\u00a0 College loans, in contrast, have lower interest rates, lower monthly payments and these payments often do not start until after graduation (though interest is still added on).\u00a0 Talk to your family banks before deciding credit cards will be used to pay for tuition and fees.\nI hate oral presentations. Is it possible to avoid them as a psychology major? No. More and more, educators and employers are demanding that people be able to communicate well orally. Practice truly makes perfect in this case. The more students stand before their peers and present, the easier it gets - though maybe not any more enjoyable for some. The majority of the upper-level psychology courses require individual or group oral presentations. Some may be a matter of minutes, others may require presenting for a fair portion of the class meeting. There are many ways to reduce your anxiety:\nPrepare early. Give yourself ample time to learn your topic. The better a topic is known, the easier the words will come out and make sense to you.\nPractice. Rehearse aloud to yourself and then to friends.\nVisit the room after-hours. Get comfortable looking at all the chairs. Imagine your peers and instructor. Stand at the podium. Walk around.\nUse lots of appropriate visual aids. Dim lights can help hide a flushed face or sweaty brow - start with an overhead! Put your title up on the screen, followed by an outline of your information. If that's not possible, prepare handouts - an outline at the least - start your talk by referring to the handout to get some of those eyes off of you!\nRelax before your talk begins - go to the bathroom, take deep breaths, close your eyes, arrive at class early, plan to begin with an overhead and darkened room. Do whatever it takes to calm yourself down.\nWear your favorite nice clothing. When you dress comfortably, you will be able to relax more easily and feel more confident. It works the other way too - people who look nice are taken more seriously. You will look as if you know what you're saying!\nDon't sweat small mistakes. With the exception of maybe the instructor, no one will know if you make a mistake. Just keep going. If the error was an important point, come back to it as if you never said it before. If the instructor thinks it's important to clarify the error, odds are he/she will do it without drawing attention to what you said.\nI have a hard time writing. How important is writing as a psychology major? Very. It's not just being a psychology major. As a college graduate, certain abilities and behaviors are expected. One of these is that you are more literate than the average person. In applying for jobs and to graduate school, your writing errors will be glaring! Once employed, you will forever be writing - letters, reports, minutes for meetings - the list is endless. You may never have to write another paper for a class, but you will be writing. Errors will be embarrassing and no longer just the cause of a few lost points. Do not graduate from college without learning to write well. Take extra writing classes, pay attention to the editing your instructors provide, and/or take advantage of the services you pay for through your student fees. As a student, you have the luxury of many sources for writing help. Use them!\nWhere can I go for help with my writing? In the building housing CASA, the college provides writing tutors. Free of charge, students may make appointments to meet with an instructor or trained tutor to review their writing. It is recommended that students experiencing a lot of difficulty go to the Center as soon as the semester starts. Bring your course requirements with you and any writing on which you have started to work. Students feeling they write fairly well may want to stop by and have a grammar check-up. Bring a paper you feel proud of and have someone find all your errors. A review of the mistakes you commonly make may be invaluable.\nSign-up sheets for Writing Tutor appointments may be made at the front table of the CASA wing.\nAppointments may be made on short notice (walk-ins) or by signing up for appointments several weeks in advance.\nIs math important as a psychology major? Math is always important. Basics are used every day. However, the only specific requirement of the psychology major is a course in statistics. The statistics courses at FSC are tough. Talk to students who have completed the course and ask about their instructors. Try to find an instructor whose style of teaching fits yours.\u00a0 Also consider making regular appointments with a math tutor at CASA. As with writing help, the services are free of charge and hours vary from day to evening.\nAre high grades really important? No doubt that we are a country of overly grade-conscious people. GPA\u2019s of at least 3.0 are often required for admission into graduate programs.

Working while enrolled in college full-time is not recommended. To get the most out of your education, you will need time to study, to participate in extra-curricular activities, and to take advantage of opportunities available only to students.\u00a0 Every student should be thinking about activities that will impress future employers or graduate school committees, as well as enhance skills and knowledge.\u00a0 Typically, it is not student-level employment positions that impress future employers.\u00a0 What employers and graduate committee members look for are internships, specialty courses, participation in the campus community (e.g., student government, leadership roles, etc) and evidence of academic achievement over and above a GPA (e.g., honor societies and memberships, pre-professional memberships, awards, conferences, etc.).\u00a0 Engaging in such activities and doing well requires time and flexible scheduling.\u00a0 Attending classes and just getting by with studies so that work hours may be met is far from the ideal.\u00a0 It also leaves your reference writers with little to write about and few means to really get to know you and your potential.\nWhat if I have to work in order to afford college? You are not alone.\u00a0 College is a choice and so sometimes compromises must be made.\u00a0 Being a college student is a full-time \"job.\"\u00a0 Students need to realize that they are investing time and money in their future earning potentials and job satisfaction.\u00a0 Doing well these 4 years will greatly impact students' futures.\u00a0 Going to college may mean applying for loans, grants or work-study, borrowing from family members, giving up luxuries like a new car, electronic devices and being \"poor.\"\u00a0 But it is temporary student poverty level!\u00a0 If you must work, work as few hours as possible and not more than 15 per week.\u00a0 If you must work full-time or nearly full-time, consider enrolling in the evening program (DGCE) or go part-time which is one or two courses a semester.\u00a0 This may simply not be the time for college for you.\nWhat if I pay for all my college expenses by credit card. Is that a good idea? Absolutely not!\u00a0 Credit card interest rates are very high and late fees add on quickly!\u00a0 Use of credit cards for more than you can pay off by the end of the month is an easy way to get into debt you may never escape from!\u00a0 You do not want to work just to pay off credit cards or to graduate with credit debt with no end in sight!\u00a0 College loans, in contrast, have lower interest rates, lower monthly payments and these payments often do not start until after graduation (though interest is still added on).\u00a0 Talk to your family banks before deciding credit cards will be used to pay for tuition and fees.\nI hate oral presentations. Is it possible to avoid them as a psychology major? No. More and more, educators and employers are demanding that people be able to communicate well orally. Practice truly makes perfect in this case. The more students stand before their peers and present, the easier it gets - though maybe not any more enjoyable for some. The majority of the upper-level psychology courses require individual or group oral presentations. Some may be a matter of minutes, others may require presenting for a fair portion of the class meeting. There are many ways to reduce your anxiety:\nPrepare early. Give yourself ample time to learn your topic. The better a topic is known, the easier the words will come out and make sense to you.\nPractice. Rehearse aloud to yourself and then to friends.\nVisit the room after-hours. Get comfortable looking at all the chairs. Imagine your peers and instructor. Stand at the podium. Walk around.\nUse lots of appropriate visual aids. Dim lights can help hide a flushed face or sweaty brow - start with an overhead! Put your title up on the screen, followed by an outline of your information. If that's not possible, prepare handouts - an outline at the least - start your talk by referring to the handout to get some of those eyes off of you!\nRelax before your talk begins - go to the bathroom, take deep breaths, close your eyes, arrive at class early, plan to begin with an overhead and darkened room. Do whatever it takes to calm yourself down.\nWear your favorite nice clothing. When you dress comfortably, you will be able to relax more easily and feel more confident. It works the other way too - people who look nice are taken more seriously. You will look as if you know what you're saying!\nDon't sweat small mistakes. With the exception of maybe the instructor, no one will know if you make a mistake. Just keep going. If the error was an important point, come back to it as if you never said it before. If the instructor thinks it's important to clarify the error, odds are he/she will do it without drawing attention to what you said.\nI have a hard time writing. How important is writing as a psychology major? Very. It's not just being a psychology major. As a college graduate, certain abilities and behaviors are expected. One of these is that you are more literate than the average person. In applying for jobs and to graduate school, your writing errors will be glaring! Once employed, you will forever be writing - letters, reports, minutes for meetings - the list is endless. You may never have to write another paper for a class, but you will be writing. Errors will be embarrassing and no longer just the cause of a few lost points. Do not graduate from college without learning to write well. Take extra writing classes, pay attention to the editing your instructors provide, and/or take advantage of the services you pay for through your student fees. As a student, you have the luxury of many sources for writing help. Use them!\nWhere can I go for help with my writing? In the building housing CASA, the college provides writing tutors. Free of charge, students may make appointments to meet with an instructor or trained tutor to review their writing. It is recommended that students experiencing a lot of difficulty go to the Center as soon as the semester starts. Bring your course requirements with you and any writing on which you have started to work. Students feeling they write fairly well may want to stop by and have a grammar check-up. Bring a paper you feel proud of and have someone find all your errors. A review of the mistakes you commonly make may be invaluable.\nSign-up sheets for Writing Tutor appointments may be made at the front table of the CASA wing.\nAppointments may be made on short notice (walk-ins) or by signing up for appointments several weeks in advance.\nIs math important as a psychology major? Math is always important. Basics are used every day. However, the only specific requirement of the psychology major is a course in statistics. The statistics courses at FSC are tough. Talk to students who have completed the course and ask about their instructors. Try to find an instructor whose style of teaching fits yours.\u00a0 Also consider making regular appointments with a math tutor at CASA. As with writing help, the services are free of charge and hours vary from day to evening.\nAre high grades really important? No doubt that we are a country of overly grade-conscious people. GPA\u2019s of at least 3.0 are often required for admission into graduate programs. However, when students do their best, seek appropriate help from professors, and show continued improvement, the effort is noticed. Effort may not guarantee high course grades or overall GPA's, but effort does show up in letters of recommendation. \"Glowing\" letters paired with good scores on standardized tests (GRE\u2019s) may still get students with mediocre GPAs into graduate programs or open doors to other desired opportunities.

General ability was determined by taking a composite of the verbal, spatial, and math ability scores.\u00a0 The data are represented in z-score or standard deviation units.\u00a0 For example, social science majors were about 0.8 standard deviations above the mean of the entire sample, whereas engineering majors were about 1.3 standard deviations above the mean of the entire sample.\u00a0 This makes sense because people who earn higher educational degrees are usually above average in ability.\nSee All Stories In\nSearch for a mental health professional near you.\nFind Local:\nHere is the rank order of the groups examined:\n1. Engineering\n9. Education\nData from the Graduate Record Examination (a select sample)\nSo, are these results replicated in other samples?\u00a0 The answer is yes.\u00a0 We also examined data from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).\u00a0 But first, let's address a key question you may be asking yourself: does the GRE really measure general ability?\nIt turns out that Meredith Frey of Otterbein University and Douglas Detterman of Case Western Reserve University have demonstrated in a paper published in the prestigious journal Psychological Science that the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) to a large extent measures general ability and that SAT scores can even be translated into IQ scores.\u00a0 Along with their colleague Katherine Koenig, they have also demonstrated similar findings for the American College Test (ACT).\u00a0 Because these standardized tests measure general ability to a large degree, it would make sense that the GRE would as well, although that still needs to be empirically demonstrated.\u00a0 However, regardless of whether the GRE measures general ability or not, the fact that we see the same pattern in a select sample (GRE) in addition to a nationally representative stratified random sample (Project TALENT) illustrates that the average score patterns for majors are quite robust.\nWhen taking the GRE, individuals are asked to indicate which major they intend to pursue for graduate study.\u00a0 Keep in mind that the GRE is a select sample of the population because only a subset of individuals who have graduated from college take this test.\u00a0 The graph below takes an average of the math and verbal subscores to indicate general ability.\u00a0 As can be seen below, the rank order of the major groups is essentially preserved, with minor variations (arts are now ahead of social science).\nHere is the rank order of the groups examined:\n1.

Education\nSo what does this all mean?\nLet me give you an anecdote.\u00a0 An individual who saw this data for the first time immediately exclaimed: \"Oh, this means I'm smarter than my brother!\"\u00a0 (In his head he probably was thinking that he finally had data to confirm what he knew all along).\u00a0 He had majored in math and his brother had majored in a social science. \u00a0I had to point out to him that this data could not be used to necessarily conclude that he was smarter than his brother, just that on average, math majors are smarter than social science majors.\u00a0 His brother could have been a super smart social science major and he could have been a less smart math major.\u00a0 There is wide variability within each group and much overlap across groups.\u00a0 What was needed in that case to determine who was smarter were their individual ability scores.\nSo remember: group averages don't necessarily give accurate information about individuals.\u00a0 The flip side of this is that if you had no information about a person other than the fact that they were a math or social science major, it is more likely that the math major is smarter than the social science major.\u00a0 But if you then found out the social science major earned their degree from an elite university and the math major earned their degree from a community college, then perhaps you might then adjust your expectation that the social science major might be smarter, because the level of institution attended also gives you a rough indication of the individual's ability level.\nKeep in mind that there are extremely smart people in all disciplines and at all colleges and universities.\u00a0 And perhaps the smartest social scientist is as smart as the smartest mathematician.\u00a0 However, that is a hypothesis that is in need of an empirical test.\nFinally, let's not forget a critical factor: what someone chooses to major in has a lot to do with their interests.\n\u00a9 2011 by Jonathan Wai\nYou can follow me on Twitter , Facebook , or G+ .

Psychology knows otherwise; Freud told them so!! The vast majority of psychologists agree with Freud, possibly without knowing their debt to him or their agreement with him. Foucault (the current holder of the Chair of The History and Systems of Thought, College De France) in his analysis of Freud concludes: no one in the human sciences (psychology is at times part of this array) is out of his debt. Thus everyone (so holding in psychology) is linked with the paradox which surrounds Freud. Freud the giant; the first major theorist to break with the Classical Age's enforced silence on madness; Freud the first to systematically listen to madness; Freud the first not to condemn madness into silence; the first to pronounce that in interchange with the knower, the knower can be known; silenced this very knower in the rescue. Freud opened up (Foucault lets us see) a discourse with difference (madness), spoke to/with difference as his theory allowed him to speak, and ordered that difference within which is every person; part of the thought of all, and part of all which is thought. It is that wide hand which Freud had; a further reason for the appropriateness of Foucault's suggestion: 'no one is out of his debt.' The paradox, of course, is that rescue brought silence, robbed the knower of the very possibility of knowing as knower (the internal paradox: that the interdict from the Vedas-is immediately confirmed by the denier: by Freud) as a double reductionism was offered by Freud: biological and theoretical. The illogic of reductionism, as knowledge, has not fully entered the marrow of psychological claims (be they 'models,' 'paradigms,' or displacements). Freud killed the possibility of the authority of the knower knowing, as only via 'biology' and Freud's theory can one know. Thus the hoax (which generally goes unnoticed), of the claim that via psychotherapy/analytics (or whatever contemporary or ancient paraphrase) 'one' can know oneself.\nBut suppose: 'one' is zero. The argot which allows primacy to the 'one of one' relationship has totally swallowed Freud. Let me give an FDA caveat to this ingestion. This mongrel claim (see: the ordinary language philosophers) that an account of 'psychotherapeutic' interchange is 'one on one,' reveals hope dragged out as knowledge (remember Mr. Dawson's quoting Koch on this bit of legerdemain). One careful account (impossible for Freud the reductionist) of the exchange termed therapy is: 'One on zero.' (This phrase emerged in one of my lectures.) The 'zero' is you, me, everyone, or that part of everyperson ('just that part' Freud was after) which is different; that which in the Classical Age (as Foucault has demonstrated) wasn't there (remember G. Stein 'On Oakland'); and which in the Modern age was locked into 'existence' by the Modern episteme. That very presence, the knower, radicalized (as we now say) the episteme, signaled (among other facets) the Modern episteme's total break with the Classical discourse (hence the sleight of hand comparisons of Kuhn and Foucault). The knower (Foucault's MAN-an expanded definition of that critical term in a moment) is authorized in the Modern age as inalienable authority, along with and separate from the authority of science. The knower, called forth in the break with the discourse of the Classical age, saw as his legend the demise of a single authority, namely; the word. Representation was the calendar of the Classical age. The 'word knew.'\nTake the word 'medicine.' In the classical age (Foucault allows us to notice) seeing/saying are still one fundamental level of language. 'Bile pied up in the body,' 'blood had become impoverished, thickened'; what was said (e.g. re: Bile, re: Blood) and what was 'there' are united in a manner totally unlike the medical dialog of the modern age. (Certainly there are remnants in the Modern age: e.g. the doctor/patient encounter//relationship; seen by Foucault as re-emergence via 'the pale powers of matrimonial fantasies'...'to so much non-thought.' The verbal performance (a critical term for Foucault) for the physician of the classical age was: 'What is the matter with you?' For the physician of the Modern age the query changed to: 'Where does it hurt?' In the Modern age verbal performance and object have the kind of independence which for example Wittgenstein gave it in his post-Tractatus work. In Freud, the gaze brings its own constant light: see the Oedipus complex.\n'One on Zero' (though admittedly coined by me as a quick reply to student alliteration) seems to tell the mark about 'psychotherapy.' Szasz has spoke about the Myth of Psychotherapy, and has kept that article's title for a forthcoming book. Szasz seems to be moving from his earlier Ryleian position to a Wittgensteinian one when he terms psychotherapy as independent, both of the psyche and of therapy, but replete as: conversation. Szasz, in his efforts to clarify psychological claims uses the work of the Ordinary Language Philosophers, Mill, and Laissez-faire economics. In Szasz's use of this trilogy, the unifying force is: 'To let be.' The 'let be' notion is the double integral of the Ordinary Language Philosophy view. 'Things (word/sentence/object) are what they are.' 'Value lies outside of the world' (of factual knowledge). The second (and smaller integral) is that of: clarification. Freud too insists on clarification, and Wittgenstein is therefore often compared to Freud. Wittgenstein too speaks of sickness (re language) seeming for some to (further) cement a bridge to Freud. Their common ground is language, though the announced similarity is vitiated by Freud's concern with 'thought,' with reductionism, with prior causes, with continuity, with teleology, with theory, etc. Two great men touching fingers for a second is the most I dare venture.\nNothing in the ordinary language philosophies, Mill, and/or laissez-faire economics seems capable of rescue of psychotherapy (now understood as 'conversation'). The 'let be' injunction, and that is precisely what 'psychotherapy' can NOT advocate, fits institutional practice no more than it fits private practice. Thus, Szasz's distinction between institutional practice/private practice seems strained (while important because of the obvious differences in control of human beings // see: psychology's most famous animal trainer, B. F. Skinner). If psychotherapy is remaindered to 'conversation,' private practice is voided. If Szasz leaves conversation to professionals, he stands among Benda's traitorous clerks. To license (as in psychiatry/psychology) conversation seems to violate basic precepts of our founding documents (free speech/derived powers), and to do exactly what Foucault sees happening; namely kill MAN.\nIn search of a designation of psychotherapy (other than the attractive one of conversation) one can offer what Dr. Ralph has offered for 'psychology in application,' namely: litany, police practice, fraud, chauvinism. All of the aforementioned can be taught (professors have no fear-your courses are safe), can be tested for, can form curricula. If the Classical age is your forte, if robbing of language is your joy, if the guarantees of our founding documents are but a nuisance, by all means write about and practice psychotherapy. Please notice that while Foucault allows psychoanalysis to be ordered under 'knowledge,' he excludes it as science. So there you are, with your christian science, as Dr. Ralph suggested. That too (christian science) can be learned, can be taught, is wanted-so what! Is it enough to use your office, your affiliation to rationalize your sound? Remember Mr. Dawson, psychology is NOT what psychologists Do! Howler, yes-sense, No!\nAllow me to take another turn, to make you look at the monumental travesty: psychology speaking as MAN. The turn is the work of Foucault. Unlike Santayana's famous quote Foucault directs us to 'archeology;' as he claims to be doing neither History nor Philosophy. The touchpoint between the two men is that without clarification of the penumbra of the discourse (used here in a general/not Foucaultian sense) what is said/is, remains unclear. Archeology is the technique through which Foucault ferrets out the 'unconscious' of discourse (not to be confused with the unconscious of Freud-though there is a touchpoint as well), allowing the user (insert psychology) to see 'for the first time' (T. S. Elliot) the full of the verbal performance (insert psychological claim/statement). Archeology allows one to notice just what it is that is/must be said and can be said in no other way (archeology is not a substitute for the empirical-does not generate empirical knowledge).\nIn the absence of archeological clarification (in our case) the psychologist will verbally perform without the consciousness that what is given (verbally performed) is given precisely because 'that and only that' can be voiced in that particular discourse. The telling point: an end to will, choice, solipsism, phenomenology; an end to a priori causes; an end to hidden meanings. No room for the 'good heart' (of the individual clinician-except as nonsense), no room for the 'I won't cop out-power to the people' claim of the therapist; no room for virginal consciousness raising; no room for entering therapy as sex; no room for 'the family' as the unity of therapy; no room for 'the marriage' as counsel; for the 'governing' confines are the parameters of the discourse.\n(An aside: This is one of the points in common between Kuhn and Foucault; the other significant similarity is the total break between epistemes/paradigms. Dialog across epistemes is not possible, nor is it possible to mix dialogs within epistemes. Kuhn, of course, has no 'archeology,' and therefore a Kuhnian analysis is not interchangeable with a Foucaultian analysis of discourse.)\nTo the remark that 'really Foucault is just using Freud's unconscious' (whether that remark is used as rescue of therapy, or as ignorance) let me reply: that Foucault's unconscious unlike Freud's unconscious, is neither theory, nor vector, nor force, nor teleology but ambience of discourse. A parallel to Foucault's unconscious is Wittgenstein's rule/meaning/object.\nFoucault argues: ...A moment would come when, from animality (the girding conception of 'madness' in the Classical age) would be deduced the idea of mechanistic psychology ...where the blindness (of madness) became the psychological effect of a moral fault; AND thereby comprises what had been (in the Classical age) essential in the experience of unreason. What had been blindness would become unconsciousness, what had been error would become fault, and everything in madness that designated the paradoxical manifestation of non-being would become the natural punishment of a moral evil. In short, that whole vertical hierarchy which constituted the structure of Classical madness, from the cycle of material causes to the transcendence of delirium, would now collapse and spread over the surface of a domain which psychology and morality would soon occupy together and contest with each other. ...The \"scientific psychiatry/psychology as MAN\" of the nineteenth century became possible. ...It was in these \"diseases of the nerves\" and in these 'hysterias,' which would soon provoke its irony, that this psychiatry/psychology took its origin.\n(An aside: To drop the medical model is to drop 'nothing' since medicine was never a founding condition of the discourse (psychiatry/psychology as MAN). The putative rescue of to/as psychology (via the removal of the medical model) is but fraud and ignorance. Szasz, generally credited with being the high priest of this error (voiding of the medical model and by return: the rescue of \"clinical psychology\"), has actually avoided this pitfall by being a Ryleian/Million/Laissez-faire economist, and recently by depicting 'psychotherapy' as conversation.)\nTo continue with the archeology of Psychology as MAN. Foucault allows that: ...the nineteenth century, by investing the famous \"moral methods,\" has brought madness and its cure into the domain of guilt. The distinction between the physical and the moral becomes a practical concept in the medicine of the mind ONLY when the problematics of madness shifts to a interrogation of the subject responsible. The purely moral space, which is then defined, gives the exact measurements of that psychological inwardness where modern man seeks both his depth and his truth...Psychology, as a means of curing, is henceforth organized around punishment...A purely psychological medicine (of course neither medicine nor psychology) was made possible only when madness was alienated in guilt... In the Classical period, it is futile to try to distinguish physical therapeutics from psychological medications, for the simple reason that psychology did not exist. When the consumption of bitters was prescribed, for example, it was not a question of physical treatment, since it was the soul as well as the body that was to be scoured... When, in the years that followed, this great experience of unreason, whose unity is characteristic of the Classical period, was dissociated, when madness, entirely confined within a moral intuition, was nothing more than disease, then the distinction we have just established assumed another meaning; what had belonged to disease pertained to the organic, and what had belonged to unreason, to the transcendence of its discourse, was relegated to the psychological. And it is precisely here that psychology was born-NOT as the truth of madness, but as a sign that madness was henceforth nothing but a phenomenon adrift, insignificant upon the undefined surface of nature ...An enigma without any truth EXCEPT THAT WHICH COULD REDUCE IT (rise Freud-rise you saviors in psychological drag).\nPsychology is born. Thus, in the modern world, what had been the great irreparable confrontation of reason and unreason became the secret thrust of instincts against the solidity of the family institution and against its most archaic symbols. Foucault lets us see that the language of Freud took over a foundation of silence rationalized around transgression. He states: ...When Freud, in psychoanalysis, cautiously reinstitutes exchange, henceforth eroded into monologue (remember my 'one on zero'), should we be astonished that the formulations he hears are always those of transgression? In this inveterate silence, transgression has taken over the very sources of speech. (See the demise of, e.g., 1st amendment guarantees, as well as the demise of the authority of the individual: the basis of all power in a free society.)\nFoucault continues ...Freed from the chains that made it a purely observed object, madness lost, paradoxically, the essence of its liberty, which was solitary exaltation... ...an ordinary police tribunal sat permanently (vis-a-vis the patient) ...the doctor (read psychologist) is not there (vis-a-vis the patient) by virtue of a medical skill or power that he possesses in himself and that would be justified by a body of objective knowledge. It is not as a scientist that homo medicus (read psychologist) has authority. ...If the medical profession (psychology) is required, it is as a juridical and moral guarantee, NOT in the name of science.\n...the essential nucleus of madness ...was a microcosm in which were symbolized the massive structure of bourgeois society and values. (An aside: discourse/praxis is NOT to be understood via the much used term \"ideology.\" Foucault rejects this effort, on similar grounds on which Wittgenstein rejects 'values' as an explication of 'words/sentences' or earlier: of propositions/simples. What is/is (for Wittgenstein and similarly for Foucault) the world 'is what is,' and all value lies outside of it; what's more what is/is accidental (thus into metaphysics/nonsense go: purposes, meanings, will and such accounts as ideology. Warning: do not confuse the 'archeological' inclusion of bourgeois ideology (as forming discourse) with 'ideology' as explicator of discourse. Foucault's persistent (and Wittgensteinian) derision of 'ideology' is of ideology as explicator of discourse. (Further aside: The term ideology seems to vie with Kuhn's paradigm for inexplicability.)\nTo continue with Foucault's analysis: ...the authority he (the psychiatrist/psychologist) has borrowed from order, morality, and the family now seems to derive from himself (remember: psychology is NOT what psychologists do) ...the objectivity (of psychiatric/psychological praxis) was from the start a reification of a magical nature... ...accomplished with the complicity of the patient...beginning from a transparent and clear moral practice, gradually forgotten in its origins and its meaning, ...soon madness itself would be held responsible for such anomalies... (what was offered then was) ...cures without basis, which must be recognized as not being false cures... but as true cures of FALSE ILLNESSES.\nFor Foucault MAN is: to think again what has been thought/verbally performed-thus essentially empirico-and also transcendental; to think again, while rooted in what is available-the time and space, the setting, the surround: for Foucault, Life, Labor, Language. What the modern episteme authorized for the first time in Western history was the finitude of each moment as thought/said by MAN. MAN is that ...living being who, from within the life to which he entirely belongs, and by which he is traversed in his whole being, constitutes representations by means of which he lives, and on the basis of which he possesses that strange capacity of being able to represent to himself precisely that life ...who provides himself with a representation of language itself.\nUnlike psychology's conventional depictions, Foucault works out in devastating detail that: MAN can not be understood as: (borrowing from biology) ...possessing functions-receiving stimuli (physiological ones, but also social, interhuman, and cultural ones, reacting to them, adapting himself, evolving, submitting to the demands of an environment, coming to terms with the modification it imposes, seeking to erase imbalance, acting in accordance with regularities, having in short, conditions of existence and the possibility of finding average norms of adjustment which permit him to perform his functions ...All this Foucault argues is but an appearance on the projected surface of biology: thus a double reductionism to biologism/scientism. Foucault allows us to see that on the projected surface of economics (another reductionism) MAN APPEARS as having needs, desires, as seeking to satisfy them, and therefore as having interests, desiring profits, entering into opposition with other men; in short he appears in an irreducible situation of conflict. Foucault thru his archaeological analysis brings us (psychology) face to face with Ghosts (Ibsen behold) out of which we (psychology) pretend substance.\n(An aside: the decades of work on 'reductionism' have seemingly not entered our (psychology's) analytics.)\nFoucault continues: ...(on the projected surface of economic) MAN is depicted as if he evades these conflicts, he escapes from them or succeeds in dominating them, in finding a solution that will-on one level at least, and for a time-appease their contradictions; he establishes a body of rules which are both a limitation of the conflict and a result of it.\n...on the projected surface of language (another reductionism), man's behavior appears as an attempt to say something; his slightest gestures, even their involuntary mechanisms and their failures, have a meaning; and everything he arranges around him by way of objects, rites, customs, discourse, all the traces he leaves behind him, constitute a coherent whole and a system of signs.\n(An aside: what now of the various schools/views of psychology? What now, given the archeological explication of Foucault, of 'what we know psychology to be'? How is it that psychological efforts to speak of MAN, and more devastating, to speak as MAN, fall outside of science; and even (as Foucault allows) as psychological verbal performance falls within knowledge, that knowledge falls outside of the Modern discourse, the very discourse which gave it birth, which allowed it to emerge as 'proper verbal performance'?)\nReply: For Foucault it is not simply a matter of reductionism, of scientism, or of reification, but it is because psychological discourse of/as MAN fails to meet the requirements of science in the Modern episteme, as well as the requirements of science in the Classical episteme. To restate: Psychological discourse (of/as MAN) is neither science now nor was it science then-even if psychology (as science) had existed in the Classical age-the usage we now have as psychology does not meet the standards of science of the Classical age. Psychology today does however imitate the philosophical statements of the 18th Century.\nFurther: as knowledge (which Foucault allows to psychology 'of Man,' as he does to the other Human Sciences), psychology can not speak 'as MAN'; since only Man (each individual) can speak 'as MAN.' The Finitude (which is MAN) prevents even that individual from restating what had been stated (shades of Gertrude Stein, of Wittgenstein, of Derrida). Remember again, that the authority which 'issued' MAN allowed that speaker an inviolability, an inalienable status. An obvious tie (here) to the vesting to each and every person those 'self evident truths' and 'powers' to which the state is subordinate and only derivative-an obvious tie to the cornerstones of our founding documents. No wonder that Psychology is seen as the least liberal of the 'human sciences,' and psychologists as the first among totalitarians.\nLet me touch on another related critical question. Why is the progress in the science of psychology so slow? Foucault's reply is that: neither the 'complexity of man' (a common hiding place for the admitted lack of progress in psychology); nor the misuse of statistics and of design (another conventional criticism used to rationalize the admitted lack of progress in psychology); nor the absence of adequately refined mathematics (an oft expressed lament-Foucault offers superb detail of the rush into mathesis-as error); none of these have kept psychology in arrears; nor have they kept the mound of scientific knowledge in psychology to a child's sandcastle. What retards psychology is its attempts to speak of/as MAN. (Wittgenstein has long ago offered a similar account.) Clearly (given Foucault/Wittgenstein) a radical reordering of what is psychology is long overdue.\nSince MAN is not of psychology, what is left? Macro-neurology? Macro-Cybernetics? Macro-Linguistics? This question nettles; and the best that I have been able to offer to date is: chronology (episodic/continuous). This 'chronology' would be a step different from literature; but if Wittgenstein holds, this chronology could say/depth grammar: nothing.\nWhat future does Foucault see for MAN? Given the ascending authority of Science, of the so called Human Sciences, of the State; given the nod to psychology-Foucault suggests that MAN will ...be erased like a face drawn in the sand at the edge of the sea.\nFor those interested in the guarantees of the founding documents of our nation, that would indeed be \"beyond freedom and dignity.\"\nI have attempted to sketch for you Foucault's arguments: 1. That neither science nor psychology can speak of/as MAN; 2. That the human sciences (those parts of psychology, linguistics, sociology, ethnology, et al, which attempt to speak of/as MAN are not science, but imitation of the philosophical discourse of the 18th century, and 3. That the standard explanations for the lack of progress of the science of psychology are delusion. I am suggesting that to speak of/as MAN is to violate the guarantees of our founding documents: the guarantee of equality (which I read as the inviolability of differences), and the guarantee that power to govern (e.g. speak) rests solely in the people (which I read: in the individual). Since a professed aim of psychology is to draw man into science, into nomotheticness, thus into sameness, a collision course has existed ever since that aim was enunciated at the birth of psychology. The archaeological analysis of Foucault has exposed the double folly of that aim.\nFor those of you who would push aside Foucault, to rescue psychology (whatever that is): let me alert you to another older combat, Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein takes man (the language user) out of nature-thus out of the grasp of science. He eliminates, as factual discourse, any part of psychology involving language usage. Wrestle with that. You might try it on the mat of promise, with Fodor, or on the sketch pad with Quine.\nAn invitation. Foucault will be a Distinguished Visiting Scholar on our campus during the week of October 17-join us in a dialog with him. Let me leave you then, with the beginning.\nKnowledge shall not, finally, know the knower. And, add to that: whatever Psychology is, MAN is not a part of it.\n1. Aron, H. (1977, September).

Learn more about the Ph.D. psychology degree as well as a few alternative graduate options that might also want to consider.\nWhat Is a Ph.D. in Psychology?\nA Ph.D., or Doctor of Philosophy, is one of the highest level degrees you can earn in the field of psychology. If you are considering pursuing a graduate degree, you might be wondering how long it takes to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology . Generally, a bachelors degree takes four years of study. While a masters degree requires an addition two to three years of study beyond the bachelors, a doctorate degree can take between four to six years of additional graduate study after earning a bachelors degree.\nRecently, a relatively new degree option known as the Psy.D. , or Doctor of Psychology, has started to grow in popularity as an alternative to the Ph.D. The type of degree you decide to pursue depends on a variety of factors including your own interests and career aspirations.\nWhat Can You Do With a Ph.D. in Psychology?\nA doctorate degree in psychology is required if you want to open your own private practice. In most cases you will need this level of degree if you want to teach and conduct research at the college or university level. While there are some opportunities available for people with a masters degree in various specialty fields, such as industrial-organizational and health psychology , those with a doctorate-level degree will generally find higher pay, greater job demand and more opportunity for growth.\nHow to Earn a Ph.D. in Psychology\nIn order to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology, you need to first begin by earning a bachelors degree. While earning your undergraduate degree in psychology can be helpful, students with bachelors degrees in other subjects can also apply to psychology Ph.D. programs. Some students may also earn a masters degree in psychology, but many doctorate programs do not require it.\nAfter you\u2019ve been admitted to a graduate program, it generally takes at least four years to earn a Ph.D. and another year to complete an internship. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, students can take state and national exams to become licensed to practice psychology in the state where they wish to work.\nWhich Specialty Area Should You Choose?\nOnce you enter the graduate level of psychology, you will need to choose an area of specialization such as clinical psychology, counseling psychology, health psychology or cognitive psychology. The American Psychological Association accredits graduate programs in three areas: clinical, counseling and school psychology. If you are interested in going into one of these specialty areas, it is important to choose a school that has received accreditation through the APA.\nFor many students, the choice may come down to a clinical psychology program versus a counseling psychology program. There are many similarities between these two Ph.D. options, but there are important distinctions that students should consider. Clinical programs may have more of a research focus, while counseling programs tend to focus more on professional practice. The path you choose will depend largely on what you plan to do after you complete your degree.\nAlternatives to the Ph.D. in Psychology\nOf course, the Ph.D. in Psychology is not the only graduate degree option. The Psy.D. is a doctorate degree option that you might also want to consider. While there are many similarities between these two degrees, traditional Ph.D. programs tend to be more research oriented while Psy.D. programs are often more practice oriented. The Ph.D. option might be your top choice if you want to mix professional practice with teaching and research, while the Psy.D. option might be your preferred choice if you want to open your own private psychology practice.\nSocial work, counseling, education and the health sciences are other graduate options that psychology undergraduates may also want to consider if they decide that a doctorate degree is not the best fit for their interests and career goals.
